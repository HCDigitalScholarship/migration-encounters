I didn&#39;t sit through your survey, so I don&#39;t know much about you, but can you tell me what the circumstances were for you to migrate to the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sure, absolutely. Well, it was because I was really poor when I was a young kid, and my father starts to work as a teacher, and then he had to get another job as a police officer. It was kind of difficult for me to get concentration for my work, school and everything like that. When I was 17, I decided to move because there was not enough money. So I decided to move. I gave it a try at first. I moved to Baja, California and then one of my friends in there told me we can try to cross the border. There&#39;s some people you paid and they put you inside a truck and there you go.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you hope for the best.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really because you felt that you didn&#39;t have enough money? You thought you couldn&#39;t concentrate on your studies?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was because we didn&#39;t have enough money. And by dad, mom, and my grandparents were very, very sick, I mean, in an ill way. One of them had cancer and my grandmother had some issues on her throat. She wasn&#39;t able to speak really good. My brothers began to work too. One of them became a police officer, too. One of them become a military man. I&#39;m the youngest one from all of them, so I decided to move. It was a chance presented to me by some friends. Like I mentioned before, we moved first to Baja, California, and from there we crossed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much school had you finished before you went?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, I finished high school. And then the process that I was... and the time that I spent in the US was three years, but the first two of them, I was in Los Angeles. Then I came back and I began my university studies. But then something happened that my brother became sick. He got cancer, so I had to move again. I spent another year over there and one of those days my mom called me, &quot;You know what? Your brother is really sick. We need you to come back.&quot; Two months after I came back, he died for the cancer. Since that moment I&#39;ve been living here. I&#39;ve been thinking to maybe move, but not right now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, how many years were you in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years. And were you working or going to school while you were there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No working, working, working. Yeah. The first time I arrived there, I work in a kitchen. Here on the high school, we got some... how to say it?... like side activities. And they show us how to cook, some procedures for cooking and things. And when I arrived there, I began working in a kitchen. Then the money was not enough, and one of my cousins that live in Delaware told me, &quot;You know, I know a guy over there that has some work on construction. You want to give it a shot?&quot; And I said, &quot;Yes, let&#39;s take it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you went from California to&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I stayed there in Los Angeles, but in construction.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but your cousin knew someone in LA?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. I see. </span><span class="c1">You did construction and then you went back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s correct. Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip; to Mexico? And then you came back to the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s correct. Crossing the border again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times did you&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two times.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the second time did you do construction as well?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Construction and then in kitchen again. The very last job that I had there was in kitchen. The last six months that I spent there, I hadn&#39;t a job in there. I was living with some of my family members in Pomona, and they were paying me to do all the home job, like washing the dishes, cleaning all the house. They didn&#39;t pay me a lot, but they allowed me to live in there and to have some money to send to my mom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you went to the US it was really to make money for the people back in Mexico? That&#39;s why you went?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was before your brother got sick?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But your grandparents were sick, so there were medical bills.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is correct. Medical bills and then, like I mentioned, the last time that I came back, it was because of my brother that died two months after I came here. The mainly reasons that I went there was to make money.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how long have you been back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hm?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you been back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In here? It has been six years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#39;m very sorry about your brother.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not worry. Also, some kind of bad stuff happened to me once that I came back here. The reason why I came back here, they never deported me. Fortunately, they never deported me, but I was catched by the police because I was dreaming too much to become a musician over there. I&#39;m always been passionate for the music. So I went to a concert and somebody call and they say, &quot;We got some wetbacks here.&quot; Yeah. So they catch me...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a raid?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A raid at the music festival?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah, yeah. And somebody called that there was some wetbacks. They catch us up and they hit me once. They told me, &quot;You know what? We will not deport you.&quot; They only throw me on to the streets. The police officers that catch me were Mexican, so it was kind of funny. They tell me, &quot;We will not deport you, but you make your choice.&quot; And I was like, &quot;What I&#39;m going to do?&quot; As soon as my mom called me and told me that my brother was sick, I said, &quot;You know what? Maybe it&#39;s not the time for me to be here. I have to leave.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;So I went to the border in California and I crossed. The only thing that the police officer told me to me, &quot;Please do not come back unless you have your papers.&quot; That&#39;s the only thing they told me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, when I arrived to Baja, California, because I crossed for el puente... that&#39;s what they call the bridge. There was a program called Welcome... how to say it... It is called Welcome Paisano. And they arranged some things for them to translate me from to here to Toluca, because I&#39;m from Toluca. They moved me from Baja, California to Toluca. They paid everything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, the government. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They paid everything to bring me here. And then I began working again in a kitchen, and then I moved here to the Mexico City. And some of my friends that were deported, they told me, &quot;You know what? We know a company which is TTEC here that is hiring people like us.&quot; Okay. Let&#39;s give it a shot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you worked for them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year. A year and three months. Unfortunately, the first month, was when my son born. After that month, he died because he was premature&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m so sorry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip; and he died, so I been in a really bad situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ve had a hard life. I&rsquo;m so sorry. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. We&#39;ve been trying to give our best.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still with the baby&#39;s mother?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely yes. She was my friend since I was 13 years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wow. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met her in a concert in Queretaro. I met her in there. I was playing in a band where I was a really, really, really young musician in that time. I met her and we keep chatting. Once that I came back three years ago, we start dating and then the last year we decided to have... Not the last year, two years ago, we decided to move together and we had a baby. Like I mentioned, unfortunately he died, but I&#39;m still with her and she is the love of my life. And I been away from every single... I never touch a drug or alcohol, nothing like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still practicing your music?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, sometimes. Yes. I play the drums and also I play the bass guitar.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you in a band?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Absolutely, yeah. I work in... as you see my image is from a, how do you say it?... rocker or something like that, but I also play salsa with a group and I have my metal band, another rock and metal band. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A metal band?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how often do you get gigs?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every 15 days. This Friday we&#39;re going to have one. Last Friday we didn&#39;t have it, but 15 days before, yes, we have it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Do you get paid?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not too much, but it is really good because I&#39;m doing what I love.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you love. Yeah. You weren&#39;t in the US a whole lot, but you speak great English. Did you know English before you went for the first time?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a little bit. Yeah, just a little bit, because since I was four, something like that, I was very interested on English music because of my father. When he was young, many, many years ago, he used to play in a band that actually, before he left them... sorry, after he left them, like three years he left them, they became famous.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. What&rsquo;s their name?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are called, Peace and Love Super Banda. They were from California, from Baja, California. They played in our Mexican Woodstock called Av&aacute;ndaro, so they became famous in there, but my father didn&#39;t make it. He was on the road and the boss, he was coming just... How to say it? It burned, the motor burned and he didn&#39;t make it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fortunately, no, no, no, no. Just the bus. He didn&#39;t make it there. The band says, &quot;You know what? We don&#39;t want you any longer in here.&quot; Three years after that they became really famous. Well, at least here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is that&hellip; listening to English music? Is that how you learned English?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Actually, listening to English music. I was really passionate with Pink Floyd, Rush and many bands like used the English in a proper way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there was some bands that I didn&#39;t like the way that they used the language, using bad words and something like that. And many of the United Kingdom bands, they were like more proper in the ways to use the language. So I was like, &quot;Oh, I like it.&quot; So I guess I learned listening to music. By that moment my father bought me a Larousse, a dictionary, to check the words, so I was listening and I write as I understand it, and then check the book. Oh, it is written like this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. That&#39;s great. Wow. And so, by the time you got to the US you were fair, at least, at speaking?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. I was able to communicate with the other people. I tried to imitate the accent, because on the first moment, it was really hard for me to get understood by the people because I had my Mexican accent, and I still have it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You speak very well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly an accent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much. I tried to imitate and do some play roles, because yeah, it was really hard. I remember the first time I arrived to LA,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I went to a Dunkin&#39; Donuts and it was kind of racist because the guy didn&#39;t understand me.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;And he took up a little menu and told me, &quot;Just pick the number.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Okay, this one.&quot; Now, okay, okay. I been practicing. In that moment I was practicing with some friends, and that&#39;s how I learned it. Then when I came back, I studied with a program called SEPA Ingl&eacute;s, Learn English, approved by the SEP, which is... Well, it&#39;s a government organization that rules all over the education here in Mexico. It is called Public Education Secretariat. Yes. Yes. That&#39;s what SEP is. I studied there when I came back and I was only one year minor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm. So did you like the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I like it a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you like about it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I liked the most, it was the... how to say it? It kind of sounds weird, but I liked the people in there. You know? There was some people that didn&#39;t like me, that hit me like I mentioned, that&#39;d be racist with me, but there was a lot of people, very, very, very nice. I love the way that they treat me, the way that they told me, &quot;There is my hand. If you want to, hold it and we&#39;re going to do this together.&quot; That&#39;s something that at least, at least here at Mexico for the last year has been lost because of the violence, because of the cartels, because of the drug sellers, for the kidnappers. That&#39;s something that has been lost. And in the US, still the people is in that way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I love the fact that I was earning more money than in here, because in here, when I worked in the kitchen, I was paid... for the week, I was paid not much, like $80, something closer, when the dollar in that time was like 12 pesos. And we really, really, really needed the money. And then actually another thing that I like a lot is the culture in general. That has the most high to me.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I tried to apply for a citizen, but I didn&#39;t make it because I have the record when they catch me on the concert.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the concert?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Yes, they told me that not that I was not... how they say it? They say like suitable to be a citizen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all you had done is just you were here without papers?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They make a record of it, unfortunately. Sorry. No, no, no. Fortunately, when I came back, that record was erased.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh good. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip; because I don&#39;t know how they call it, but it&#39;s like a special program that is active for three months. And in that moment, if I wanted to apply, I didn&#39;t make it, and that&#39;s what happened. They told me, &quot;You&#39;re not suitable for this, so just erase that idea from your mind.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">But now that&#39;s been expunged, so you can apply for a visa to go back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes I can apply. Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will you go back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to, I want to, because on the first moment when my son was alive, I thought, &quot;I&#39;m going to bring the best for him.&quot; I talked to my wife and we decided to move to the US.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Like I mentioned, then they told me about this and I say, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll just give it a shot in here.&quot; Yes, I really want to move or stay here and help people. Something that I like a lot is to show people how to do the things. My nephews, my cousins, also my aunts, whenever I come to my house, because my house is from here, like to one you have to travel like three hours. So whenever I go to visit them, I do some English lessons for them. I understand that maybe I&#39;m not very good at this, but I try to give them an idea. So they know the numbers, the ABC, the colors. Whenever I have the chance, I buy movies for them, only in English, Mickey Mouse and everything like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do my effort to improve the things. By now, fortunately my father is... how to say it... retired. By now they are living good. All the bad stuff that happened to us, like we say here, it happens for something. By now they are good. My two remaining brothers, they have a good life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes, yes, yes. And we have to do the best. We try to do the best in here as much as we can.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreams for always is to be a musician, maybe not famous, but to be a musician. That&#39;s what I love the most. And maybe, because I was also involved in gangs, to show the kids to not involve in that. It&#39;s not good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When were you involved in gangs?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was 13 years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Because a lot of... Where I live, actually where I live it&#39;s called Tenancingo. In Delaware, there&#39;s a small place... well, not too small... that they call them Tenancingo Chiquito, small Tenancingo because there&#39;s a lot of people from Tenancingo living in there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Delaware?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. A lot of neighbors that been deported that went and came back and everything like that, so they were in gangs. So I was a young kid with nothing else to do than study and do... how to say it... I don&#39;t know. Can we use just a small, bad word?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you can use as many bad words as you want.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Stupid things. I was a small kid just studying and doing stupid things, and I decided to get into the gang. And in there, I was kind of hurt because... kind of hard to me, because I took drugs, alcohol. I was a mess in that moment. Then I realized, why are we fighting for a piece of ground? You know? We&#39;re fighting for something that doesn&#39;t belong to us and we are hitting each other. When I came to the US, it was kind of hard because where I used to live, I lived in a truck. There was a lot, a lot of Sure&ntilde;os. How you said it? Southside 13 gang members. And it was like, &quot;If you want to be here, you got to join us.&quot; And I was like, &quot;No. Don&#39;t want to do.&quot; I was like-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you thought you had gotten away from the gangs?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fortunately I realized very young that I committed a mistake being in a gang. I was like 16 years old when I realized, &quot;No, this is not what I want. I only give some like sadness to my family if I keep here, so let&#39;s quit it.&quot; But when I went there, it was like, &quot;You got to be with us because if you want to remain and to keep yourself safe, you got to be with us. You have to go to work with us.&quot; And I was like, &quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. We hear a lot about young Mexicans who go to the States as children. They grow up and they join gangs in the US.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you were in Mexico. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the gang been exported from Delaware to your hometown?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. Yes, absolutely. It was exported from there because in here... well, in Tenancingo, in my city, there was kind of gangs, but the only things that they were doing is like painting graffitis and fighting between them. That&#39;s all. It was back in the 2000s... like in 2003, 2004, if I can remember... that the first like US gang appear in there. And it was a lot of Chicanos, like they know them, forming a gang, and they&#39;re here in Mexico. By that moment I had my computer with internet, so I began to get into it, and I realized how they work, that they were in a lot of states here in Mexico. But yeah, they growed in the jails, then they became out to the streets and then here to Mexico. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&#39;ve expanded?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. A lot. Almost like 70% of people that works in the building with me are gang members. Some of them be in jail for killing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In TTEC?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70%?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like 70%.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are still gang members?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe not still, not still active, but they used to. Yeah. Some of them, from that 70%, like almost like the half, been in jail for robbing, for killing, some of them. Some of them were deported and that&#39;s why they end up in jail like one or two years. And that&#39;s all. What I feel glad about is that I didn&#39;t have to pass through that. I passed a lot before, so that&#39;s what made me think about to do the right things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ve had a lot of hardship. You&#39;re strong.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much. Yeah. The most recent death that we had to cross together, my wife and me, it was his father. His father was one of my biggest friends. He was like, actually like me. He was 45 years old... no, 48 years old... and he was the coolest person that I ever met. He had his ears expanded like me. He was a part of like a&hellip; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a minute. Ears expanded? What does that mean?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the earrings.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ear plugs. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. And he was 48.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was an old guy to do that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He used to work for the electric company here called Mexican Electric Syndicate, but that syndicate just got sold and he got paid when they cut him. So he paid for him to leave and he used the money to make himself a business, a small business, a small restaurant. And he enjoyed the rest of his life being a hippie. And he passed away on December 29. Yeah. It was really hard because we were doing everything for the New Year&#39;s Eve. I was working here. I was eating some tacos in the corner and they call me. &quot;You know what? Your father-in-law died.&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it sudden?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He passed away because of a heart attack. He had one like two months before and he make it. But for the second one he didn&#39;t make it. It&#39;s been hard, but here we are.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here you are. Do you think your wife and you will... or your girlfriend, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re married...will try to have another child?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes, of course. Like I mentioned, when we were coming up here, the reason why I&#39;m afraid to elevators it is because we were at the funeral of my son and the funeral was... Not the funeral. I don&#39;t know the correct word for that. I don&#39;t have it, but at the funeral, when we were doing the preparations and everything like that, we have to go like to the fifth floor, and I got stuck in the elevator for like 20 minutes. The worst thing is that I was with one of my small nephews. By now he&#39;s four years old, but at that moment he was three. And the only thing that I did in that moment is to keep myself calm. I put him some videos on my cell phone and he never noticed about that we&#39;d been in there, but, but it was a really bad experience for me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I went to psychological therapy and also I&#39;m on psychological therapy because of my son&#39;s death. We&#39;ve been working and we decided that by the end of this year, we will try. We&#39;ll try. And also one of the dreams of my brother, it was to adopt a child. My brother made it, like we say, he made it. He become a chef. He went to Germany, to the Czech Republic, to Spain, to the US. Actually, he&#39;s the one that helped my family and me a lot. I was like his small... how to say it, like his small kid. Yeah. And he helped me with with my studies, with the school. And he helped a lot to my parents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never told us that he was cancer until he died. We realized that, that he was cancer. He was 33 years old when he passed away. But since he was 19, he was working a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And travelling&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah. He made successful of himself and all his dreams, he make it. But the only one that he didn&#39;t make true, it was to adopt a child and give the opportunity. Because like I mentioned, my house when I was a child, it was made from wood and from paper. Yeah. I remember all these days when it was raining, it was really hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Wow. Well, you&#39;ve come a long way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;re strong and you have great dreams.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, sure, sure, sure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your wife, does she work as well?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. She work as well, and by now, I work a lot in here. And also I work doing some cakes in my house. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You make cakes?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. What they call them 3D cakes. We use fondant to make like sculptures with cakes and everything like that. And I sold them and I... well, I sell them and we raised enough money by now she&#39;s going to end her university. She&#39;s studying to be a teacher. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s great.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will finish like in two months.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. You guys are doing great. Given all the hardship that&mdash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s really inspiring.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspiring. I think we can finish up, but is there anything you want to say to finish, share with people about your story that people might want to hear about you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Javier</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sure. Absolutely. One thing that I always keep in mind is never stop dreaming, because the real life, it&#39;s all those dreams that somebody make real. This building was a dream. Somebody make it real. My job was a dream from someone and he make it real. This full life is made of dreams, so never stop dreaming. That&#39;s what I have to say.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Anne</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thank you so much.
