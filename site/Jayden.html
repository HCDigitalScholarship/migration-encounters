My first question for you is why did you leave Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I left Mexico when I was five years old, I mean, I was very little. My brother, my older brother... We&#39;re four brothers. Well, two girls, one boy now. My older brother is in the US, and my older sister was in the US as well, and my other brother and me were here in Mexico. So, my mom and my dad decided to move over there to join them, just reunite with the family, start a new life, a better life for me. And that&#39;s how we moved there to the US.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah. I remember... I don&#39;t exactly know the day of it, but I remember it was snowing, and it was my first time seeing snow. That&#39;s how I got so excited. I remember I was with my... I think it was like school uniform from here Mexico, just like a jacket. I remember I wasn&#39;t cold. Yeah, probably I was freezing, but I didn&#39;t feel the cold. I just wanted to go outside, touch the snow, like feel it, how was snow like. I remember I was eating it and I was like, &quot;It tastes good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Not the yellow snow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Not the yellow snow, no. Just the white snow. The pure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">And so, did you go to school in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Yeah. I went all the way from middle school</span><span>&nbsp;- </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;No. Elementary school, all the way to high school, and half of my cosmetology school was also there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">And do you have any teachers or friends or people that you remember?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">I do. I remember my teacher, ____ and she was my English teacher, and a few others that... right now, I can</span><span>&rsquo;t </span><span class="c4">think of their names, but also, my ESL teacher, my math teacher. My history teacher was so nice to me. He knew I was an immigrant. Like none of them knew. Basically, none of my closest friends knew. Also, because I was afraid of, if I tell them, wh</span><span>at</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;if they go tell someone, and I get deported, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you knew?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I knew I was an immigrant. I was so happy when I also got my driver&#39;s permit. I was like, &quot;Oh my God. I feel like an American.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Did you get DACA?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">No, I never applied for DACA. No. I knew about it after.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But would you have qualified?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah, I believe I would have qualified for DACA, because I did stay over more than 10 years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What was your life like in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Can I say everything?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Everything. Yeah, go for it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Well, my life in the States, obviously, I went as a boy, and it comes to a point where you just like, you&#39;re not comfortable with who you are. You knew you were made to go further in life, you&#39;re meant for something else. First of all, I was coming out as a gay boy. That was when I was 14. When I was 15, I went to a psychologist, and he told me that there was something with me that I wasn&#39;t happy with myself. I wasn&#39;t happy with myself. I wasn&#39;t happy with the guy who I was. I wasn&#39;t happy with seeing myself every day and waking up and like, &quot;Oh my gosh. Yeah, I have a boy body.&quot; I felt disgusted in that way. So, I told my dad, I told my family, they were very supportive. My brothers, my sisters, everybody was so supportive. They&#39;re like, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go through the transition.&quot; You know, first, the psychologist, you have to go through all that therapy. Then, it&#39;s the hormone changes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started transitioning when I was 17. So, I wanted to do my transition back in the States, but I couldn&#39;t because it&#39;s more expensive there. So, I told my dad, if we ever go back to Mexico, it&#39;s cheaper. It turns out here in Mexico, it&#39;s cheaper. It&#39;s way, way cheaper. So, that&#39;s why also I ended up doing my whole transition here in Mexico as well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">How old are you now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I&#39;m 26 years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Oh, cool.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">So, yeah, it&#39;s been a long journey.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah. Tell me how you ended up back in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Okay. I ended up coming here to Mexico because my grandma had cancer. So, my mom, for a long time, she hadn&#39;t seen my grandma and she knew about this. She&#39;s like, &quot;I want to spend time with my mom. Even if it&#39;s just three months, one year, I want to see her.&quot; So, I put myself in her shoes. I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, mom, let&#39;s risk it all. And let&#39;s go to Mexico.&quot; You know, I didn&#39;t had what I have now. So, we came here in Mexico and we&#39;re like, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s...&quot; My grandma passed away three months after we arrived to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">My mom got to a point where she got depression, and it</span><span>&nbsp;just </span><span class="c3">wasn&#39;t good. It wasn&#39;t really good. We started our own business here in Mexico. We started a bakery. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Oh, cool.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">After like three years, we closed it. My mom had a tumor. I think it&#39;s... Can I say it in Spanish? I don&#39;t know how to say it in English. </span><span class="c12">Es</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">un</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c12">derrame cerebral</span><span>&nbsp;[stroke].</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I don&#39;t know how to say that in English.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Yeah. It was really, really bad. Okay. My mom got well. I wanted to go through my transition. Like I really, really wanted, but all that money was like, &quot;Oh my gosh, like I need to focus on my mom. My mom&#39;s first.&quot; I did the whole thing, the surgery, the thing where you&#39;re like</span><span>.. </span><span class="c4">I was so happy about it. I talked to my mom. I remember she was in bed, and I was like, &quot;Mom, I need to do this for me, for myself. I don&#39;t want to be selfish, but I need to do this for me.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;I know. I know you&#39;ve been holding up a long time, and you need to do it for yourself. And if it&#39;s something that you want to do, do it. Just do it. Just go for it. If it&#39;s going to make you happy, go for it. If it&#39;s going to make you unhappy, don&#39;t do it. Don&#39;t do something that&#39;s going to make you unhappy. Do something that you&#39;re happy abou</span><span>t.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Do something that you&#39;re going to be waking up every day, and you&#39;re going to look at yourself and have a big smile for you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">So, I went through the whole transition. It&#39;s the woman I am today now. I&#39;m still working on the whole name changes and all that stuff. Because when I was in the US... Here in Mexico, you have to do the whole paper issue, which is another like discrimination here in Mexico that they do. Because basically, just go, give yourself and be like, </span><span>&ldquo;O</span><span class="c4">kay, I am a trans woman. What&#39;s next? Here&#39;s the paper. Fill this out.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;But they don&#39;t do that. You have to go through the whole process here in Mexico. So, it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh my gosh.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">So, how long ago did you start your transition in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">My transition? Like around five years ago, five years. First, it was the basic, then, it was the whole shenanigan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What was it like coming back to Mexico from the United States, especially as a transgender woman?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">It was hard, because here in Mexico, they discriminate a lot. Even though they say they don&#39;t, like you feel. Like people literally harassing you. I&#39;m not talking just like transgender women, I&#39;m talking about just like regular woman, born natural female. I&#39;ve seen it here and there. People harass them literally. It just hurts. It just hurts, because you&#39;re like... Some people don&#39;t </span><span>have a</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;good self-esteem, and it could hurt them really bad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">I resigned of my other work. I used to work at a photo studio with a few colleagues back in Monterrey, but I quit that job because they had comments about the whole being gay and transition issue that I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with. I wasn&#39;t able to tolerate. I&#39;m a very tolerable person. I think I&#39;m the most calmful person. Like literally, it&#39;s hard to get me angry. I do get frustrated, but I&rsquo;d never -- it&#39;s hard to get someone angry like me. But I got to a point where I wasn&#39;t able to tolerate that. So, I quit that job. Came here to TT, and it was way better. I mean, it&#39;s so much better. People here are really nice.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I mean, they don&#39;t discriminate as much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudi</span><span class="c13">a</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">As much. There&#39;s like 5% of discrimination, but they don&#39;t say mean things that are going to hurt people. Because I remember back in the States, I had a friend who committed suicide because of that issue. And I didn&#39;t want people to do that. I mean, what&#39;s not to love about life. I mean, it&#39;s hard, it&#39;s hard. But if it was easy, we</span><span>&rsquo;d</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;all be like frustrated all the time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. What&#39;s been the hardest part about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The hardest part of being back here in Mexico, I think it&#39;s adapting, adapting to the whole situation, to a whole new way of living here in Mexico. To earn pesos, instead of dollars. I think that&#39;s the hardest thing. Because here, you have to have... Obviously, here in Mexico and anywhere else, you have an administrative way. But yeah, it&#39;s just really hard, like earning few little money and being killed over time, and be pa</span><span>id</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;very less little money.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Yeah. So, you went </span><span>to the United</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;States up until...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">High school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">High school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">And part of my cosmetology school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Cool.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">So yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia</span><span class="c13">:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that&#39;s nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I love that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">What do you like about cosmetology?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">What I like about cosmetology is the mesotherapy. Well, here, it&#39;s called </span><span class="c4 c12">mesoterapia</span><span class="c3">. You know, to get that slim body?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah. I like that. I mean, I&#39;ve always had a dream of being... One thing was being a woman, becoming a woman. I know for me, it&#39;s like different becoming a woman because, obviously, for being a woman, you need to have the natural parts and everything. I know that. Right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you don&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">But I think if you can behave like a woman, act like a woman, or respect yourself like a woman, you&#39;re already done.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Okay? It doesn&#39;t matter what&#39;s on the outside, it matters what&#39;s in the inside.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">So, </span><span>being</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;through that and going through all that process made me think, I want to have a nice body. Yeah. Obviously, I want to have a nice body. Work for myself. Evolve, evolve in my self-esteem. But you know, working and everything, it&#39;s just like, &quot;Oh my gosh. I need to put that aside.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah. And you&#39;re working at TTEC now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I&#39;m working at TTEC right now, as of, a month now? I think. No. Two months.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">And how has that been?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">It&#39;s been good. I worked at TP before. Teleperformance. I used to work at Teleperformance. But it&#39;s a whole story. I was engaged three years ago. He broke my heart. It was just a toxic relationship, and I wasn&#39;t able to stand up for that. And we were going to get engaged</span><span>. W</span><span class="c4">ell, married, but</span><span>.. </span><span class="c4">We were already engaged, but we&#39;re going to get married. It turns out, he ended up cheating on me with a girl. So, it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; I really, really... That&#39;s where I put my hands down and was like, &quot;You know what, it&#39;s your life, do whatever you want.&quot; We went through illegal issues. Yeah, we did, because we were </span><span>like a united</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;couple, relationship, I think, so we had a business together. It was just awful. So, I decided to just give everything to him. I didn&#39;t want to deal with him. I was like, &quot;No. No. You hurt me already, so I don&#39;t want to stand up for that anymore.&quot; So we broke up. Well, no. He cheated on me, so yeah, we broke up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been all by myself for like almost two years now, almost two years, and it&#39;s been going good. I&#39;ve done a lot of things. I&#39;m working on my dad</span><span>&rsquo;s - </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;My dad has a house here in Mexico, so I&#39;m fighting for that, and I wanted to have it be mine now. Because you know, I want to have apartments and everything. I want to make it like big.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Is he in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">He is in the States, but he&#39;s with someone else, so...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">And how has it been? How was it to separate from your family who</span><span>&rsquo;s </span><span class="c3">in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">It was hard. I mean, I love both of my parents. Part of my transition, and part of being who I am, it&#39;s because I didn&#39;t have that paternal, like that fatherly presence in my life. So, I think... What I&#39;ve been told by psychologists, that I need</span><span>, p</span><span class="c3">robably, at one point, I need that paternal. That&#39;s why I need that paternal figure in my life. But you know, I&#39;m happy right now. Like I&#39;m happy making it big. And my mom is with me. My other brother is with me. So it&#39;s like, okay, I have family support. Like what else do I want? Money.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Do you feel safe in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Honestly, being... Well, I think, at a point, yes sometimes, but I know me, and I really, really have to stand up for myself and be like, I don&#39;t have to show that fear of being here because people will eat you, literally, they will harass you. I&#39;ve been harassed and it&#39;s not good. Because being trans, being both Mexican and having that English background, people</span><span>, e</span><span class="c4">specially delinquents will harass you because of that. Like, &quot;Oh, she has money. She&#39;s </span><span>gringa [foreigner] </span><span class="c3">or something,&quot; or &quot;She&#39;s trans...&quot; they take advantage of that, and yeah, I don&#39;t feel safe.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Do you feel Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I feel Mexican. I feel Mexican because, obviously, I was born here in Mexico. But I mean, I feel also American because I was in the US and I got that experience. I wasn&#39;t just there chilling. I mean, I was learning, preparing myself for life, for what&#39;s now. And also, with learning English. Not many people have that opportunity to experience and be like, &quot;Oh, I was in the States. I know English.&quot; To compare to someone who was here in Mexico learning English, it&#39;s different perspective. Even their accent is way different. So, it&#39;s like, okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">I don&#39;t know, like if you&#39;re comfortable with telling me what the difference is</span><span>, </span><span class="c3">if you&#39;ve experienced it, between being a trans woman in the United States versus being a trans woman in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Okay. Being a trans woman in the US, it&#39;s... Because I was very little, so I think it wasn&#39;t that obvious. I mean, there were some people who are homophobic, but not as much as here. I think you could have gone to the police, and like they will back you up. You can go to your school and they will back you up. And if you go here, there is no one to back you up. Like you have to build that strong, independent woman inside, just a person that won&#39;t tolerate that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">And I think that&#39;s why psychology here is like way different.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">And trans women here are way different from trans women back in the USA.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you could have stayed in the United States, what do you think you might have done?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Okay. What I want in my life is</span><span>&hellip;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I&#39;ve wanted, I&#39;ve always wanted to have my own line like Jayden Lee cosmetics, like have my own personal line of business. I think being there... I would have been making it big already. Here in Mexico, yes, I&#39;m making it big, but in a different way. You know, owning my dad&#39;s business, which I&#39;m both working here, and I&#39;m also working at my dad&#39;s business. So, it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m doing two things at once,&quot; but I&#39;m not doing what I love, what I want, what I want to do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah. Is that your dream to have that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">To have my own business</span><span>, h</span><span class="c3">ave like extensions, but just to have my name, like do collabs with people, but my own line, obviously.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">That&#39;s awesome. I&#39;d love to buy from that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah. You&#39;re more than welcome.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">I guess the last few questions </span><span>to reflect</span><span class="c3">. What can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Just make them feel safer. I&#39;m not saying just Mexican immigrants, just for every Mexican to feel safer, to make them feel more safer. </span><span>T</span><span class="c4">hat no delinquency are going to like... Or just to have more jobs because people without a job go to that source, I believe. It&#39;s like when you have nothing to do. When you take your phone out or when they take your phone... That&#39;s what I experienced this week. I got robbed. Like literally. I love reading. Right now, I&#39;m reading </span><span class="c4 c12">Mujer Millonaria</span><span class="c3">, I think Rich Woman, because that&#39;s my dream, to become a rich woman. I literally stopped reading that book because I&#39;ve been doing so many things. But then, I said, &quot;Why stop reading it? You have time. I mean, the only thing that was stopping you was your phone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">So, without my phone, I started reading, and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed. That people who are doing positive things go further, and they educate </span><span>themselves</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;more. Other than people that are not doing positive things, that are not even doing anything, they just stay in one place that they&#39;re comfortable with, with one place. So, just make them feel safer here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah. How would you characterize the experience that you have in Mexico so far?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Like from a scale to one to 10, or like...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">However you want to talk about it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">I mean, I&#39;m not saying... I&#39;m not complaining, &quot;Oh my God. It&#39;s very horrible.&quot; Every experience leads to a point of life. I think if I wouldn&#39;t have come to Mexico, I wouldn&#39;t have grown as Jayden. I wouldn&#39;t have grown as a transgender woman. I wouldn&#39;t have grown just as a person. And if I would&#39;ve stayed in the US, maybe I would&#39;ve grown further, or maybe I would&#39;ve been stuck in a place, you know because of my immigrant situation. And here in Mexico, I don&#39;t have limits. I don&#39;t have a government that </span><span>tells</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;me, </span><span>&ldquo;y</span><span class="c4">ou can&#39;t do this because you&#39;re an immigrant.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I do have a government telling me what not to do, right? [chuckle]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">But they don&#39;t care.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I know you&#39;re working on getting your papers settled and everything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I would like to, I would like to work on getting my papers settled, like my American papers. That&#39;d be really nice. But I&#39;m working right now. I&#39;m working on getting papers as Jayden.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah. And my last question is why do you think that Mexicans have such a negative perception of returning migrants?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Because some migrants... It just depends on the people and the type of people. Because I know there are some... there&#39;s good and bad people, right? But I think they&#39;re afraid. Like I&#39;m afraid here, not of the Mexican people, I&#39;m afraid of the... I&#39;m afraid of the people who are back in the States. I knew some of them that become delinquents now, and they&#39;re like stealing us. And it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh my God, I&#39;m scared.&quot; Like, am I working just for them? Or like</span><span>,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I have bills to pay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">That&#39;s what I mean.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Those are all the questions that I have.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Oh my god. Okay.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">This is now a space for you to say whatever you want to say, if there&#39;s anything else that you want to add.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Okay. No. That&#39;s good. It was nice talking to you. It&#39;s nice sharing my story. I know it&#39;s </span><span>been a</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;little bit, but it was nice talking...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Are you satisfied with what you said?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jayden Lee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Yeah.
