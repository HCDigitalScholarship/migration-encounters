So this is Claudia. I am interviewing No Mood or Victor. And yeah, we&#39;ll just get started. So first I want to thank you for coming out and speaking with us. I understand that talking about these experiences and kind of telling them can bring about emotions that you may not want to feel or things that you don&#39;t want to relive, and I want to say that I totally understand that and that I hear that. And I want to just say how I think it&#39;s good to kind of say that. These stories are important, your story is very important and it&#39;s important to also just shed light on the realities of migration and the human side of it, which is something that people don&#39;t normally see. So it&#39;s awesome that you&#39;re here and that you&#39;re speaking with us and willing to share all of this, so thank you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, totally. You&rsquo;re welcome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my first question for you is why did your family or yourself decide to leave Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexico is, I mean, just like any other family in Mexico, the money isn&#39;t really the best part, so pretty much economy was just why they decided to migrate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. How did you cross the border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like detailed? I mean, I don&#39;t remember it because I was two months old, but my mom told me about it and I was crossed in a 16 wheeler, a trailer. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a car?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, in a car.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what&#39;s your earliest memory of the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would probably be kindergarten. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me about it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Yeah, sorry. Just first day of class, that would probably be my earliest memory. First day of class in kindergarten, just arriving at the school and getting to know everybody and that was pretty much it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you remember any teachers or any friends that you made in school that had an impact on you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah my&hellip; I guess that was my favorite teacher of all time, it was Ms. Merrill. Yeah. She made an impact on my life. She was very caring and helped me out with my English because I had to get adapted to it since, it was pretty much just Spanish spoken at home. So I had to get adapted to English. Ms. Merrill and, you know, friends along the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me about your life in the States, how was it here? What did you do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, it was great. Yeah, we had everything. It was really never&hellip; yeah, we couldn&#39;t ask for more. I mean, I couldn&#39;t ask for more, neither did my sister, so it was really great. I mean, pretty much just school that&#39;s pretty much all I did. I was there up until where I was 12, so I just finished sixth grade and we came back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you came back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so where were you in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in North Carolina.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how was North Carolina?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities, the community, the people that you were around, basically?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In North Carolina, there&#39;s a lot of African-Americans, so it was pretty much that. The community we were surrounded by, there really wasn&#39;t any racists. I mean, I never got discriminated in any way in the United States. But the authorities&hellip; not really, I mean, me personally I wasn&#39;t scared of them. I could say my parents were, regarding legal issues, but me, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how old are you now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I&#39;m 20.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;ve been back here for about eight years?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah eight years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you guys return to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, I guess got... She bought piece of land here and she built a house and she said, &quot;Well, I think I&#39;ve done everything I have to do, so we&#39;re just going to go back.&quot; Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was just your mom and your siblings over there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was two sisters, my nephew, my stepdad and my mom. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you came back and what was the return like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hard. I mean, it was difficult. First of all after a few months, maybe a year of staying here, money goes by fast. So it was difficult for my mom just to being used to winning a lot amount of money to winning a small wage here. And well, I had to get used to it also, because over there we had everything again and well, it was difficult adapting here, most of all because of the lifestyle. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the hardest part of the adaptation?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um&hellip;What would it be? I mean, I think it would just generally be like the money-wise. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what did you do when you came back, did you go back to school or&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean, I got enrolled in, what would it be? Middle school. I finished my middle school and I kept on studying until-. I dropped out of high school, yeah, because again, money was tight so as soon as I turned 18 I started looking for jobs to help my mom out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what jobs have you had? What have you been up to?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean, I&#39;ve been working at call centers, which is with English and not high school, it&#39;s pretty much the best paid job you can possibly get, unless you go to a tourist zone. But call centers&hellip; I used to freestyle on public transport. Yeah. And yeah, pretty much. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. What was your favorite thing about free styling?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberty, just the freedom of just being to do whatever you want and making people smile, I think. Even though in Mexico city everybody&#39;s stressed, so, it&#39;s hard to make people smile, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#39;ve only been here three days, so why are people stressed?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I mean, do you notice the difference in... for example, my hometown is in Veracruz. It&#39;s like a... So over there everybody&#39;s chill and everybody&#39;s laid back. They have, like I don&#39;t know, It&#39;s really a different, and here everybody&#39;s working and everybody&#39;s in Metro or buses and everybody&#39;s going fast. They just live faster, I think. And I think it&#39;s more stress in this city. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is your whole family in Mexico city now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I still have two sisters over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over there in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how has that separation been?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see my little sister every year. She was born in New Jersey. My sister hasn&#39;t been able to come. She&#39;s a resident now, but she hasn&#39;t been able to come but... Well, yeah. I mean, it&#39;s been hard. My big sister, she&#39;s like my second mom. Yeah, she always takes care of me and stuff like that. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. And, do you feel like there&#39;s any disconnect from, that you have a disconnect from Mexican culture because you were in the States for so long and basically grew up there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Mexican culture, I mean, what would it be?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe just-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I don&#39;t know the story of Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe not. Yeah. Like Mexican culture or just Mexico in general and then the society and the people here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. At first, it was. I mean, till day, I don&#39;t know the story of Mexico at all. I mean, I think I know a little bit more of the United States than I know from here, more because of the elementary and stuff like that, but yeah, I guess you could say. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And has that translated into you? Have you had any experiences of discrimination and such for being a returning migrant?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I mean, not really discrimination. Not at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good, at least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. At least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And I guess, do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m Mexican, a hundred percent. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you could&#39;ve stayed in the United States, what do you think you would have done?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. I probably would&#39;ve finished high school, probably would&#39;ve... I really don&#39;t imagine it. No. Just like every other life, I guess, over there, just work until you&#39;re 40 and then just come back and spend it all over here and then I don&#39;t know, probably that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Do you think you&#39;ll go back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe with a visa, but illegally, I wouldn&#39;t go back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I guess now that you&#39;re back here in Mexico, what do you think that you&#39;ll do? What are your dreams from here on out?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreams... Doesn&#39;t matter what it is? It doesn&#39;t matter what it is, no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Yeah, no it doesn&#39;t matter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a famous artist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s just my goal since five years ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artist? What do you want to do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what genre, or?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah? I mean, I do pop, RNB, trap, things like that. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;d like to sing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, just pretty much sing. My biggest dream would be a featuring with Drake, but yeah, that&#39;s too big.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. If you can dream it, you can definitely get there, I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s awesome. And so, do you mostly do it in English or in Spanish?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly Spanish. I do have a few songs in English though. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool. And so what do you love most about doing that and why would you that to be your biggest goal?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My biggest goal, because&hellip; I mean, it&#39;s pretty much just like a passion and being able to win a lot of money because of that passion and being able to give everything that maybe one day my mom gave me, back to her, that&#39;d be my biggest dream. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this may be a stupid question, but what do you sing about or is it just like you mentioned, freestyle? Does it just come to you, or is there a theme? What do you like to sing about the most?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty much a sad boy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad boy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Pretty much a broken heart. Yeah. Yeah.

That&#39;s cool. Have you released any music or any music videos or mostly just videos of you just singing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s just a cover art and yeah, just the songs. I have two songs there, so I think you&#39;ll enjoy them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes you think that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you&#39;ll enjoy them, yeah theyr&rsquo;e&hellip;I think they&#39;re good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. No. Yeah. For sure, that&#39;s awesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds really cool. I definitely will. Okay. And that&#39;s really cool. So I guess I&#39;m just going to ask you just two more questions and then give you some time to reflect if you want to tell me anything else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in terms of migrants who are returning to Mexico, what do you think that the Mexican government can do to help them reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people that are currently in the States and get deported, they really don&#39;t have nothing here. Like at all. So I think shelter, food, just transportation, or maybe just, I don&#39;t know. Pinpoints to where to get hired, I think that would be a big bonus for the Mexican government just to help out a little, because it is hard. It is hard to get adapted over here and especially when-. My mom had a house here, but some people don&#39;t have anything. So yeah, I think that would be it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And I guess, because you mentioned that you do still have family that live in the States, so what can the United States government do to help Mexican deportees or Mexican returnees and the families that they leave behind in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that&#39;s tough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t have to have an answer. I don&#39;t even have an answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip; (long pause)Yeah. I don&#39;t think I have. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a right answer for that, but maybe helping their families come back here, because I don&#39;t think they got deported for a reason maybe illegal aliens, quote unquote, like they like to call us. But yeah, just helping their families come back and just get reunited with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So those were pretty much all the questions that I had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Victor:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. We&#39;re good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Cool. So thank you so much. I&#39;m going.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>
