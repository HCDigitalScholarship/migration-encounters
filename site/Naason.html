class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press record. It&#39;s Claudia and now I&#39;m doing the interview portion for </span><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">. Basically, this is just... I&#39;m just going to ask you some questions and you can just kind of talk me through your time in the States, but mostly your return to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then at the end I may have some reflective questions, and those are more broad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah. I guess, first of all, I want to say thank you so much for coming and speaking with us, and I want to acknowledge that I understand that sometimes talking about these stories and retelling these experiences can be a little difficult, because they bring about memories that you don&#39;t want to-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I already feel choked up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I apologize for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I definitely think that it&#39;s good to know how important your story is and how important it is for people to hear it, not only here, but in the States and everywhere, to kind of understand the realities of migration and the human side of migration, which is what we&#39;re trying to get at.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Here we go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you good?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;m good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Let&#39;s do this. So my first question is, what are your earliest memories of the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My earliest memories. Well, one thing that really marked me was something that... Well, I was pretty young, my mom was still pregnant with my brother, my brother John, was that the FBI raided our house. That&#39;s one thing I was like okay, that&#39;s the first impression of me being here in the United States, the FBI raiding our house and treating us like crap. I think that&#39;s what pretty much marked me from the first start of... Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they raid your house?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something about a confusion, that they mixed up a file or something like that, and our grandparents&#39; names came up. And yeah, they stormed the house and my mom was pregnant. They made her get on her belly and everything. That was pretty... To me that was like, okay, seeing all these dudes just waltz into our house and tell us what to do and put us on the floor and handcuff us, that wasn&#39;t cool. I was like, about, what? Four, five years old around that time. Yeah. I was already there for... Yeah, I turned three there, but I don&#39;t remember too much of that because I was just too small. You know? But yeah. The first thing. After that, kindergarten and all that stuff... It got easier, but at first it wasn&#39;t really easy at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s crazy. When I ask this question, the answer...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get so many... Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... That I get usually is like, &quot;I remember seeing snow for the first time,&quot; or, &quot;Eating a hamburger.&quot; But I guess these experiences are common, too, but people just don&#39;t talk about them as often.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;m going deep down. So, yeah, it&#39;s kind of crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, and so what did you do in the States? Did you go... You went to school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I went to school. Well, at first we moved around quite a bit because of the immigration. My parents had this idea that if we moved around a lot they wouldn&#39;t catch us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did work for a while. But yeah, it got me... Well, it helped me out a little bit because I learned English a lot quicker because I was meeting a lot more people than I would have, obviously, in just one place. So I was making a lot of friends but also learning a lot of different accents and stuff like that. It was kind of cool because, thanks to that, well, thanks to my dad, I learned English not through the traditional way of going to school and stuff like that. I learned it by reading and talking to him. I like reading, so yeah. I don&#39;t know if you noticed I had a book with me when I first came in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it helped me out because I would block out everything else and just concentrate on reading and I would learn like that. It was pretty cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you have any friends or teachers or people that had an impact on you when you were growing up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I actually do. A couple of teachers. One I remember, actually a history teacher, Ms. </span><span>Tannit</span><span class="c4">. Yeah, she was a pretty cool teacher. In a wheelchair, &nbsp;she didn&#39;t have a couple of fingers. It sucks. But she was a really nice person. You know? And Ms.</span><span>Bassett</span><span class="c0">. Ms. Bassett was my English teacher. She was pretty cool. She liked to do a lot of jokes. She was a little nerve wracking sometimes. You couldn&#39;t really tell what she was going to do in the next... She was just really playing out funny, but it was kind of, &quot;Okay, what&#39;s next?&quot; Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you like school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pretty fun sometimes. But sometimes it wasn&#39;t. Bullying was a factor because I was kind of chunky back then. Really, really chubby. I was getting called </span><span>&ldquo;M</span><span class="c4">eatball</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and stuff like that. Yeah. Kids are harsh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kids are really harsh and really honest. It sucks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know you were undocumented when you were growing up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Well, at first I didn&#39;t. You know, my parents didn&#39;t actually tell me. I started finding out because, okay, pretty much all my family is </span><span class="c4 c5">morenita</span><span class="c4">, (dark-skinned) and I&#39;m </span><span class="c4 c5">guero</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(light-skinned). So yeah. I was like, &quot;I&#39;m American. Fuck it.&quot; You know? Sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can curse, that&#39;s fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&#39;s kind of crazy because all my cousins are like, &quot;Dude, </span><span class="c5">eres Mexicano</span><span class="c0">.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot; I used to think that I was American until I was like five. Until I learned it the hard way I wasn&#39;t American, I was Mexican and I could get caught at any time. So I would, at my house, speaking Spanish, outside of my house, just English. So people like, I could blend in. It was kind of hard at first, because I used to have a really, really hard time speaking because I used to stutter a lot. Way, way a lot. Thanks to learning a different language it helped me out controlling my tongue so I could stutter less. I still stutter. I have to slow down sometimes. I don&#39;t know if you notice, I take a lot of pauses. So, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so what was your life like in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first it was pretty cool. You know? But when I started realizing that if you didn&#39;t have a social security number you couldn&#39;t get a job and stuff like that. And so it started getting harder and harder. So needing the fact that I needed... Well, I needed money, so needed to work, so it was kind of hard to get a job, a legal job. Even at a Taco Bell they would ask for stuff like that. It&#39;s kind of hard. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to do the... The first thing I had to do was yard work. That&#39;s what they forced us to do. Because you don&#39;t have a social security, it&#39;s yard work. Like all Mexicans. It&#39;s very degrading sometimes, they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re a yard man?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, fuck.&quot; Yeah. It sucks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you didn&#39;t apply for DACA because you had a few misdemeanors?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I didn&#39;t actually get to apply because of the misdemeanors. I was going to. Some of my cousins did have it. They had more misdemeanors than I did. I don&#39;t know if I got the shitty end of the stick. And they applied, and they had more misdemeanors and they had more track records than me, and they applied and got it. I&#39;m like, &quot;How&#39;s that possible?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I only have a couple misdemeanors and I didn&#39;t apply.&quot; Just how the judicial system over in the United States works, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What misdemeanors did you have?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, family problem type things, like at the house and stuff like that. I did get caught up once in a, what&#39;s it called? I went to Walmart and I had no money and stuff, and I jacked a pair of Dickies. So, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my first offense as an 18-year-old, so they were like, &quot;Okay, we&#39;re going to go easy on you.&quot; Just like I got 72 hours in jail and then, all right, I&#39;m out. Stuff like that. Really stupid stuff on dares and stuff like that. I know, I was just being a little kid and stupid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever... Was your area... Did you ever have any run-ins with gangs or that sort of thing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Crips, Bloods, Brown Pride. My school was a freaking mess sometimes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you a part of any of them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried not to hang out with any of them, but since my cousins and most of my friends were Crips or either Brown Pride, so they either associate with them, so yeah, I got marked down also in police as a Crip. I don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s crazy. I&#39;m like, &quot;Dude, I do hang out with them, but I&#39;m not one of them.&quot; It&#39;s very different. And just kind of like the saying goes, wrong place, wrong time type stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did that happen a couple times?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, a couple times. Just for being with them I would get caught out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you&#39;d be pretty much in and out of juvie? Is that what you said in your survey?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Pretty much in and out for like two years. Constant struggle. Now that I look back at it I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, I should have listened to my mom.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mom was like, &quot;</span><span>chancla</span><span class="c0">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stop.&quot; Yeah. Oh, dude. Had a homing beacon to my head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time. It&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you didn&#39;t finish high school in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I wasn&#39;t able to because I got deported. Tried doing school over here, but, yeah, if they don&#39;t have... You don&#39;t have an actual diploma or something to </span><span>[validate]</span><span class="c0">, just making your Mexican studies actual legit, so I pretty much have no studies here in Mexico. I have a little paper that says I did go to school in the United States and that&#39;s it. And I&#39;ve tried getting my documentation from over there for my diplomas and stuff like that, but since it&#39;s a personal record over there it&#39;s sealed. So only me or a signed document from a judge can open it. So, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how old were you when you got deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you only went to school to 10th or 11th grade?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, 10th grade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10th grade? And so how did you end up back in Mexico? How did you get deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, here&#39;s a little story. First I got deported and I was over in Sonora. From Sonora, I was there for about three days while I got in contact with my family. Because when they deported me they took away phone, money, and extra clothes I had. They only let me come out with a pair of pants, two shirts, about three socks, and three underwear, and a pair of shoes that I had in my backpack. Thankfully, my mom put inside my pants a bit of money, hidden inside the money. I mean, inside the pants. And that&#39;s how I was able to survive the first couple of days. And after that she told me that I had an uncle, a political uncle over here in TJ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A political uncle?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, a political uncle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a politician?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s like a...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, </span><span>un t&iacute;o pol&iacute;tico</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Un t&iacute;o pol&iacute;tico</span><span class="c0">. I don&#39;t know how to say it in English.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think they have a word for it, but I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about. Don&#39;t worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. But no, I went to Mexicali. In Mexicali, I was there for about, almost four years. First year was the freaking worst. Oh, man. It sucked. If I thought the first three days was bad, the first year was bad. Because living in Mexicali, first of all, the weather there is freaking insanely hot. Insanely hot, dude. Oh, it&#39;s the worst. Okay? First. I was used to air conditioning. Over here in Mexico, air conditioning is not cheap at all. At all, at all. Yeah, and then when I went to that uncle&#39;s place, well, the first week he took care of me, supposedly. After that he let out</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like how do you say it here in Mexico, &nbsp;[Spanish 00:13:38]? He let the real person out, and he&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, you got to pay for the bills, you got to pay for this,&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Dude, I just got deported. I&#39;ve been here a week. A week and couple days. You seriously want me to freaking cough out money?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s like, &quot;This </span><span>month is </span><span class="c4">on you. This </span><span>month </span><span class="c4">is on you.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;All right, forget it. I&#39;m not going to argue with you. I&#39;m not going to fight with you. What I&#39;m going to do is just go out and get a job.&quot; What I did was I had, like I mentioned to you, no ID, no papers. I only had my birth certificate with me and a couple papers from deportation. I went around a couple restaurants and I finally found this restaurant, and I talked to the owner. Thankfully the owner understood that recently </span><span>I </span><span class="c0">got deported and I needed money. He&#39;s like, &quot;Dude, I can&#39;t pay you in full, like fully fully because you don&#39;t have all your documentation. But I&#39;ll help you out.&quot; He was the only person that actually said, &quot;I will help you out.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because not even my uncle was like... Dude, he was charging me to be with him. I&#39;m like, &quot;That&#39;s family? Nice. That&#39;s really nice way to put family in... Top notch there,&quot; you know? But after that things started getting a little bit better because I got this job. Instead of paying my uncle the money I told my boss, I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey, you might help me find a place,&quot; you know? He&#39;s like, &quot;You know what? In our bodega, there&#39;s an extra room on top. Use it. Don&#39;t pay me rent. Just work it. Just work it off.&quot; Fine by me. That&#39;s the first... That&#39;s how I started off. From there it&#39;s just been, like the saying goes, look out for yourself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what do you like the most about cooking?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food. Sorry, I&#39;m sorry. Sorry, just a natural reaction. The food.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. What do you like to cook? What&#39;s your favorite thing to cook?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like international. I like foreign foods. My own country food, like Mexican food, it&#39;s awesome. But tasting other countries&#39; foods, it&#39;s like me being over there. It&#39;s like a different language. Cooking gets you a lot of different places. If you don&#39;t know how to tell someone something, cook them something, and they&#39;ll understand. It can be either a sorry, a thank you, anything. You can say it with food. It&#39;s awesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely agree. So tell me more about that first year being back here. What was hard, what happened?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was hard was getting people to understand that it was a language barrier, pretty much. When I came back to Mexico, first of all, first it was a language barrier. Because I was so used to speaking English. At my house we would speak Spanish, but it was more Spanglish and English than Spanish. Because people at home were trying to also learn English, so we would try to mix it up too, you know? But second thing was the money. Over in the US, all the bills are the same color. Different denominations, but same color. Over here it&#39;s Monopoly money. So many different colors, so many different denominations. And you&#39;re like... The first thing, I will never forget this. When I first got here, the first thing that I did when I get out was like, okay, I want something sweet. Something to eat. Okay? And I started, I had, what? 125 dollars, approx, what I had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First thing I did was, okay, I bought some gum. Some gum and a cigarette, because I was anxious, I didn&#39;t know what to do. I give him a bill. I get all these colorful bills, and I was like, &quot;Okay, no, no, dude, just give me back my money.&quot; I haven&#39;t even opened up the... They&#39;re like, &quot;Okay, this is the money here in Mexico.&quot; I did not know how money worked here in Mexico. That&#39;s how bad it was. I even told the judge over there. I&#39;m like, &quot;Why would you deport me, dude? I have nobody over there. I don&#39;t know anybody. Almost none of my family is over there.&quot; Here, literally, if it wasn&#39;t for my wife and kids, I don&#39;t have anybody, because my other family... I say my other family, it&#39;s because I pretty much don&#39;t know them. I know them because I&#39;ve talked to them through Messenger, through Facebook or on the phone. But I see a personal relationship, they remember me. I don&#39;t remember them. Stuff like that. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m going to backtrack just for a second. Did you fight your case?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried to. But found out it was just pointless because they were going to screw me over anyways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And you signed voluntary departure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Once I found that out, because once I was in Eloy, Arizona, the library was open to everybody. So I started reading. Looking into my case. I&#39;m like, &quot;No, even if I do fight the case, it&#39;s going to be two, three years of fighting it.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah, and if I do, by any chance, win, it would be temporary. It wouldn&#39;t be for good.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Dude, they&#39;re just trying to screw me over. So just, you know what? Let myself go voluntary, speak to my family, see what I can do.&quot; But it&#39;s been 10 years. You know? Well, 11 years and some change. But, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is it like to be separated from your family?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here come the... It sucks. Yeah, it sucks. I even told my wife, I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay. I envy you. You have your mom, your dad here. You can even give them a hug. I haven&#39;t been able to do that in almost 11 years.&quot; Yeah, I talk to my mom and dad and my siblings and everything, but it&#39;s not the same. Talking to them over the phone, by Skype, FaceTime, stuff like that, it... Sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s totally fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just freaking hard. Because being able to see them or not, you know... Seeing them in front of you is freaking... Yeah. Yeah. Here come the emotions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry. Yeah. It&#39;s...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sorry, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s totally okay. It&#39;s totally fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&#39;t expecting this. But yeah, that&#39;s the hardest part, not being able to actually see them with your own eyes, you know. Let alone just a handshake. You know? Because when you lose family, friends, job, a life, basically, from one night to the other, it freaking messes you up here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it fucks you up over here. Hard. I haven&#39;t talked about this in a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s totally understandable when I talk to people and they tell me that they&#39;ve never told anybody that, because it&#39;s also... It comes with the experience. It&#39;s like bottling up all your emotions and being like, okay, it&#39;s time, just pick myself up, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s forget about this...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because basically, on a constant day</span><span>-to-</span><span class="c0">day basis I tell my wife, &quot;It&#39;s a new day. New beginning. Put the past in the past and just continue.&quot; I try not to look in the past, and it hurts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you meet her here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I did. Well, not here in Mexico, but thanks to Mother Nature I met her. </span><span>Cuando pasarlo Hurricane Manuel</span><span class="c0">, the tropical storm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was working in </span><span>______</span><span class="c4">. And I have an uncle that was working in </span><span>________</span><span class="c4">. And he&#39;s like, &quot;Hey, there&#39;s a couple job openings because due to the storm they need a lot more people to do social work and stuff like that.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;And I know you like doing social work. You&#39;re going to get paid to do social work. Want to join?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Sure. I don&#39;t have a job right now.&quot; I had just recently got </span><span>separado</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;because I got out of a bad relationship, and</span><span>&nbsp;I, y</span><span class="c4">ou get out of a bad relationship, you go through </span><span>periods where you cry</span><span class="c0">. To lick your wounds and stuff like that. I went with my grandma and my dad, my biological dad. Total asshole. Sorry. I hate his guts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah, it turned out that she was the person I had to meet to turn in my paperwork and stuff like that. And so we turned out to be in a cool relationship because at first we were friends. She was my crying shoulder. I would whine so much to her. She&#39;s like, &quot;I know everything about you. You&#39;re so whiny and you put on a tough face to other people, but when you really get to know you, you&#39;re just a puppy.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me that.&quot; Just like, she knows me the best, the good way, the bad way, and the better way. So that&#39;s the best way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a good thing. You know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you have children?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, with her I only have one daughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three other kids from the other relationship.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexico, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico. Yeah. So you mentioned in your survey experiencing discrimination here for being a returning migrant?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It sucks. Well, over there in the US, when you look white, they treat you like a White.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay? Over here in Mexico, </span><span class="c4 c5">si </span><span class="c5">eres guero</span><span class="c4">, (light-skinned) they treat you like shit. So it was like, &quot;Oh, Christ. You really freaking fucked me over, man.&quot; How do I put it? He&#39;s funny in so many fucked up ways. Okay? He has a weird sense of humor. Okay? He makes people judge you by just how they see you. That&#39;s pretty much it. Here in Mexico, by how they see you is how they treat you. I&#39;ve had really good jobs where they have paid good, and I&#39;ve gone up to... Like </span><span>VIPs</span><span class="c4">. Here in Mexico, if you go up </span><span>to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>VIPS</span><span class="c4">, and you don&#39;t have a</span><span>, no vas etiqueta</span><span class="c0">, like you&#39;re dressed up, they don&#39;t treat you nice. But you show them the cash, and, &quot;Oh, sir, I will treat you like no other.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;re like, &quot;Do I have to look nice to be treated nice?&quot; Okay, I can dress okay or dress nice or whatever, but it&#39;s not me. It&#39;s not me being comfortable. I dress semi-formal. Or even not even formal. You know? And that&#39;s how people treat you. Here, okay. I&#39;ve been on both sides of the law. I&#39;ve been locked up when I was in juvie, and all, being a little kid. And when I grew up, I decided to be a cop. Total 360, 180 type thing going on, because my mom even jokes around with me, she&#39;s like, &quot;They used to chase you, and now you chase them.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s kind of weird.&quot; Total difference. But it helped me out. I was a cop almost two years. But when I saw the...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here or over there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, tell me about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c5">Son corruptos</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(they are corrupt) Oh my God. I learned the real side of Mexico being a cop. It sucks. It sucks. Yeah, they... If you think being in the armed forces here is cool, at some point it is, because you get to help people out when you really like the job. But when you have crook bosses that work for the mafia and stuff like that, that&#39;s where I saw that, where I told you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not cool. Not cool at all. Because you get to see things that you don&#39;t normally see. You get to experience things that you don&#39;t want to experience. You know? Yeah, they don&#39;t make... You&#39;re not the person that you really are. They make you like that. You know? Because I used to be a calm person. Now I&#39;m just looking over my shoulder all the time. It&#39;s not cool. Because it puts you on edge all the time. Because you know the real deal about Mexico. It sucks. Sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so did you quit? Or did you like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I quit. Literally, I just, after I saw all that, I... Well, I saw a couple other things before that, and experienced a couple other things. But that was the drop that made everything go to shit. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&#39;re comfortable saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll say it. Yeah. When you know that your fellow companions beat up a drunk person and let him die... Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s when you&#39;re like, &quot;Okay</span><span>, that&rsquo;s it</span><span class="c0">&quot; That&#39;s where you draw the line. You&#39;re like, &quot;No, okay. I can&#39;t be part of this anymore.&quot; And they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, he was resisting arrest.&quot; &quot;Dude, he was drunk. He&#39;s a homeless drunk person. He&#39;s going to resist arrest because you&#39;re taking him from his home.&quot; And they beat the living crap out of him and let him die? And you were part of this? Not by doing it, because you saw it and you couldn&#39;t do anything about it because your commander&#39;s like, &quot;Did you see anything?&quot; &quot;I didn&#39;t see shit. I didn&#39;t see nothing. I wasn&#39;t even here. I was at home.&quot; Stuff like that. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Wanted to be military, but after that I was like, &quot;No. If it&#39;s in the police like that, local police is like that, the military?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. No. That&#39;s... You see the both sides of Mexico. And yeah, it&#39;s not cool. There&#39;s a crappy and a fucked up side. There&#39;s some good sides, very few. But yeah. It sucks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so about your documentation and stuff. Are you still trying to get what you need, or how&#39;s that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in some cases, like, okay... There&#39;s one or two things, well, actually, three or four things that I still need, like passport, Cartilla Militar Liberada (proof of military service). The more technical stuff to get better... Es que, Here in Mexico, documentation is important. Because if you don&#39;t have documentation, they don&#39;t give you a job. The more documentation you have, the better job you can get. I learned that really quickly because I&#39;m like, okay. [Spanish 00:30:19]. That&#39;s all I had the first couple years. And I only get minimum, really minimum wage jobs. Started getting more papers, started getting better jobs. And soon as I started learning I could exploit my way of knowing English and a bit of French, all right, awesome. Call centers. They pay more, you get more services, you get better options. I started doing that from there. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what you were trying to do now? Go back to a call center?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I just found out that the coding businesses right now is something new that&#39;s going to be... I learned two things here. Okay. This new age, either technology or food is the only way to go. Technology or food. Because medical and all of that use technology. And you never stop eating, so technology or food is either the way to go. So yeah, I&#39;m trying to think about going back to call center because right now, yeah, I do need to keep working because I have a family to support, and bills are going to pile up quick. So, yeah. I still need to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I&#39;ve been asked that question so many times. Well, neither. Because there&#39;s a couple of ways to</span><span>&nbsp;put it.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;There&#39;s even a song about this. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Bi</span><span class="c0">nationals?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c5">Se </span><span class="c5">llama</span><span class="c4 c5">&nbsp;de ni </span><span class="c5">aqu&iacute; ni alla</span><span class="c0">. It&#39;s a way to put it. You know? You&#39;re over there, they treat you like a foreigner. You come back to your own country, they treat you like a foreigner. So, yeah. I know I am Mexican. I got the birthmark and everything to prove it. But I don&#39;t even feel like it, because your own people, they don&#39;t treat you like your own people. Your own family don&#39;t even treat you like your own family sometimes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we always hear the saying, &quot;Neither from here nor from there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Ni de aqu&iacute; ni alla</span><span class="c0">. Yeah. I&#39;m going to get that tattooed somewhere. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;d be</span><span>..</span><span class="c0">. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw this, speaking of tattoos, I saw this really funny one the other day. </span><span>Dice, &ldquo;una frase Chile in English</span><span class="c4">.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Literally the words </span><span>&ldquo;una frase Chile in English</span><span class="c4">.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And you&#39;re like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no. That&#39;s going to be on your arm forever</span><span>!</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, but you read it and you&#39;re like, and you&#39;re expecting a cool phrase in English. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cool phrase. Something. You just read it and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, that is so stupid and so cool.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It&#39;s so stupid. I&#39;ll take 20.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, man. It&#39;s awesome. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Last year, because we also were here last year, and I learned about the saying </span><span>&ldquo;Ahuevo&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the first time in my life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;Ahuevo&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">, yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m never looking back.&quot; Because we met a guy who had it tattooed along his arm here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Ahuevo</span><span class="c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like </span><span>&ldquo;Ahuevo</span><span class="c4">.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no, that&#39;s not cool. Like you said, that&#39;s going to be permanent, man. Don&#39;t do that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s been a year, and I&#39;m still not over it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Ahuevo!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think about it and I&#39;m like, &quot;Wow, this man really has that tattooed forever.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just like putting YOLO on your forehead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have a </span><span>homie</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that, okay, he took LSD and a lot of drugs back in the day, and he got messed up. But now he&#39;s over here in Mexico, he&#39;s like, &quot;I know I lived the life like YOLO, but why did I get it tattooed on my face?&quot; He has YOLO, Y-O-L-O, right here. Just stamped between two horns. I was like, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re crazy, dude.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;m like, &quot;You can live the life like it&#39;s the last day of your life, but don&#39;t tattoo it on your forehead.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave it alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave that part alone. You know? Your face is what they see, man. Come on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s crazy. That&#39;s...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He really went for it. You know? He lives by the life of YOLO, so hey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can you do? So in what ways do you think that the US has shaped who you are today?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what ways? Well, you could say that the American education over there, it&#39;s a pretty basic education. They need to do... They would need to step out of the routine thing. They&#39;re only learning certain things. I remember, there&#39;s this song about it. The Mexican education looks to progress different ways, in different directions. American education just has one way. And that&#39;s been like that from the </span><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c4">80s, back then, and it hasn&#39;t changed. You know? But it&#39;s helped me out that the fact that, okay, I&#39;ve learned a certain way. A, B, and C. There&#39;s no other way around it. You know? That&#39;s how you should learn. And it&#39;s pretty cool, because the education over there has helped me out</span><span>, and </span><span class="c0">being courteous, please and thank you and all that kind of stuff they show to you in the school. And over here it&#39;s helped me out because I act like an American sometimes, courteous and all that. I like helping people out and stuff like that. But people don&#39;t see it like that here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve learned a different way. You know? Yeah. I&#39;ve learned the way of helping people, not fucking them over, like how they do here. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. If you could have stayed in the US, what do you think you might have done?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would I have done? Kept on studying. You know. Culinary arts is my calling, so I would have probably... Because, watch, I even remember this. Two nights before I got caught up in all this I was at a school competition. We were cooking it off, having... It was awesome, because we went to a chocolate art show at the, I even remember this, the Hilton hotel in Nevada. Dude, chocolate was the theme. Everything was made out of chocolate. The food, the drinks, everything. If you liked chocolate, it was heaven. It was just plain out heaven. Our school made Beethoven&#39;s Third Symphony all in chocolate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my God. Were you a part of the team?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. The actual paper, it was white chocolate. The notes was caramel chocolate. I mean the... I remember how they&#39;re called, where the notes go?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little lines, yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little lines were caramel chocolate, and the other was dark chocolate. The notes were dark chocolate. So chocolate over chocolate on chocolate. We got to destroy it afterwards. It was the best thing about it. You know? But culinary arts was my calling. So yeah, I pretty much guess I would still be doing culinary arts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I know you&#39;ve been back in Mexico for 11 years, but what do you think you&#39;d like to do now? What are your dreams and your aspirations?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still are. It&#39;s opening my own restaurant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you open it? What would be the restaurant?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing with... I have this thing, like you go to a restaurant, they give you a menu of what you can eat. But if you go to a restaurant, this is my idea. If you go to a restaurant and it&#39;s like, okay, I&#39;m in the mood for ribs. We make the ribs for you. Anything, the menu would be anything on the menu. Anything that you wanted. Whatever the hell you wanted. International...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything but the kitchen sink.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. That could be a good slogan, though. Nice. Yeah, okay, because typically you go to an Italian restaurant, and just Italian. Mexican restaurant, just Mexican. Open an international restaurant where you can go and eat whatever the hell you want. That&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve been trying to plan out. It would be really expensive, though. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s a good thing, but yeah. Got to start off small to go big, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So now we&#39;re onto the more reflective part of the questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, dude, I want to like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not, it&#39;s really more of government stuff. So it may not necessarily be about like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuck Trump.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You can totally say that. So what can the Mexican government do to help returning migrant reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, they should meet them. Meet and greet, I would say. Dude, you&#39;re coming back to your own country, okay, yes. But sometimes people like me, we&#39;re not born over there, but raised over there, that get deported. They don&#39;t know jack shit about Mexico. You might know, okay, it&#39;s a cool place. A lot of crime and stuff like that. But when you really get down to know it, you have to learn on a day to day basis. Because people, if they would go out to meet you at the border or at where you&#39;re going to be dropped off or picked up or whatever, &quot;Hey, welcome back,&quot; you know? At least that helps you out. You know? A welcome back feels good. Or welcome home or something, the way that you&#39;re losing everything from one day to another. It&#39;s something that why don&#39;t they just do it? Meet you there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a couple of nonprofit organizations that do help you out, like Guardian Angels, I think, is one of them. They help people out, it&#39;s pretty cool. If you&#39;re over stuck in the desert they help you out and come back or across. And stuff like that. There&#39;s a couple... Guardian Angels is all throughout the border. So it&#39;s pretty cool. And if they did it like that, yeah, people would be a lot more welcoming here. Yeah. People are assholes. Sorry, but yeah. Mexicans are assholes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so what do you think that the US government can do to help Mexican deportees and the families that they leave behind?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US? By what you&#39;re asking is what could they do to help people that got deported or that got left over there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. Well, there should be emotional help, first of all. Emotional. Because you&#39;re breaking up families. You&#39;re splitting people in half. Yeah. That would be one thing. You know? Because even remembering this puts me in unease. Yeah. They should just stop harassing just one race. They&#39;re just freaking harassing. You&#39;re Hispanic, you&#39;re being harassed. Sorry to say this, but White people, Americans, they&#39;re just white, white is a color. Some Americans are freaking assholes. Racist. If they would just stop being... Well, American is a potluck of people. Why can&#39;t they just accept that Hispanics are needed there? Because without Hispanics, one day without Hispanics, America would be fucked. Literally, would be fucked. Black Friday would be... Yeah. They need to get that through their head, that we as Latins or Mexicans, how you say, we&#39;re worth it. We&#39;re hard people. Hard working, hard at heart sometimes. But you just need to stop harassing people. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very true. We&#39;re on our last few.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I can make it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting there. Why do young Mexican men in the US turn to crime and gangs? Why do you think?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they don&#39;t leave them any other options. You know? First, social security numbers are enemies over there. If you don&#39;t have a social security number over there, you can&#39;t work. And if you can&#39;t work, what do you turn to do? You&#39;re either borrowing or stealing. If you can&#39;t steal, you start doing other things. And if you borrow more than enough, you have to do other things to pay it off. They force you. They don&#39;t actually tell you, &quot;Hey, if you don&#39;t have a job, go steal.&quot; But what other options do you have? What other options do they give you? They don&#39;t give you many options. Okay, sometimes there&#39;s some bosses that are more lenient. Okay, they don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t have a social security, they just want people to work. Like the fields.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, people say, &quot;Okay, they&#39;re taking our jobs.&quot; But yeah, when would you go see an American out in the field? Only if he&#39;s the boss. But them bending over eight hours straight, picking any kind of fruit, or dirty jobs, they don&#39;t freaking do them. You know? And they pay us what they want because we don&#39;t have a social security number. We can&#39;t report them because we have no rights over there. Even they say if we do, technically, I&#39;m saying this in parentheses because it doesn&#39;t work. If they would just give us a chance. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. And what can... This is kind of similar, but what can the Mexican government do, then, to prevent migrants from turning to crime and gangs when they come back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, first, to have their local authorities help out people instead of fucking them over. Here, if you don&#39;t have an ID, first of all, they harass you until they find out who you are. Second, so that they don&#39;t harass you, </span><span>y</span><span class="c0">ou have to give them cash. And you&#39;re freaking trying to get cash and they&#39;re trying... Your own people are freaking fucking you over. If they would stop that, or at least try to, or have some dignity or integrity about that, yeah, it would help out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, instead of just saying things, put it into use. You know? Like right now, this president that we have right now is helping people out. I can see. I can see the change. You know? Other presidents, they would just steal from us. Right now, hopefully, if the returning migrants come back or... Hopefully they don&#39;t have the shitty end of the stick like how we did back in the day. Okay? Because I&#39;m talking about 11 years ago. 11 years ago it was even harder than it is right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah? And right now it&#39;s a little bit easier because social media, stuff like that, is helping people out. Back then, not even Twitter was out. Not even WhatsApp was out. You couldn&#39;t find out things like you can find out things right now. If the Mexican government would help the returnees just by, first of all, a job. We just need a job. First of all, a freaking job, because if you don&#39;t have a job... They say money isn&#39;t happiness. Fuck that. That&#39;s a bullshit saying. Without money, you can&#39;t live. You can&#39;t eat, you can&#39;t go to the store, you can&#39;t buy your stuff. You know? You need money for everything. To basically live, you need money. Because if you don&#39;t have money, you can&#39;t eat. That&#39;s one thing. If the Mexican authorities would help us with a first job, trust me, things would be a lot more different. If they would allow us to get a first job.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you don&#39;t have documentation, oh, you can&#39;t get a job. Dude, it sucks. You&#39;re back home, you got deported. Okay. At least one job to help you get on your feet is all we need. That&#39;s all we ask for sometimes. A little bit of confidence and a job. A little bit of trust. Trust us to get a job, you know, to work. Don&#39;t give us a kick in the ass and shove us off. That&#39;s what they do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so my last question is why do you think that people in Mexico have a negative perception of returning migrants?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because we know we&#39;re coming back to a shitty place. Simple words, straightforward. We&#39;re coming back to a shitty place. Nothing but corruption, drugs, crime, and people that don&#39;t support you. Would you want to come back to a place like that? Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s very fair. Yeah, those were all the questions that I had. And now I just want to give you the chance, this is like this moment&#39;s space where, if you have anything else that you want to add or anything that you think that you didn&#39;t get across or that you want me to know or anybody who will listen to this to know, now&#39;s the moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just haven&#39;t spoken about this in a couple years, so yeah, you&#39;ve got pretty much all the good stuff out. So there&#39;s a lot more, but all the things that really [inaudible 00:49:30], yeah, were brought to light. Yeah. I haven&#39;t talked about this in a long time. It feels weird. But yeah. That&#39;s pretty much...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird in a good way, or in a bad way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&#39;t place my finger on it yet. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s good or bad. I&#39;m going to be really emotional the rest of the day. I can tell you that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it sucks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thank you so much. This was awesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for opening up and talking to me about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, it&#39;s not easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know. So it&#39;s really brave. So thank you very much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Naason</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&#39;re good now.
