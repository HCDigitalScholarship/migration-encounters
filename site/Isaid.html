And I wanted to just thank you for coming to talk to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, telling your story may be painful and if it is, I&#39;m very sorry. But I hope that you feel good telling us the story and that it&#39;s important to be heard. So thank you again. Since I wasn&#39;t at your survey, you can just start by giving us an idea or giving me an idea as to what motivated your migration to the United States, the circumstances behind it, how old you were, things like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Well, you have my name, Isaid (redacted last name) &nbsp;I grew up in Mexico City, but my mom left when I was eight years old to work in the US and she has been there ever since. I started here in Mexico until ninth grade and then my mom decided it was time for me to go to the US with her. So I went there and I started high school, but I never felt like I belonged there. It was really hard for me leaving there, cause I didn&#39;t have many friends. I was really homesick. And that&#39;s actually the reason I ended up coming back to Mexico. So I lived there four years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years, yeah. It was high school. And I did a ESL course, English second language. And then I&#39;d say it was enough and I came back. I was feeling really homesick.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your mom left you when you were eight?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she leave you with your grandparents?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, my grandparents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where was your dad?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never met him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you went through ninth grade.... So she left when you were eight and then you went to the US when you were about 14 or 13?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, 14, I think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was six years without her. That must have been hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was. It is till this day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you guys talk a lot on the phone, or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we keep in contact through WhatsApp or Facebook. And I go visit her whenever I have vacations. I go over there and I visit her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went initially, when you were eight. Was that just to make more money?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah, yeah. She was working here in Mexico, but she got a job offer in St. Louis, Missouri.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Louis? Yeah?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But she didn&#39;t get it at the end. And she ended up living in San Diego.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it has nothing to do with... But I think she really liked it there, so she stayed. She wanted me to stay there. My grandparents wanted me to stay there, but.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of work did she do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays she babysits through the week days. And in weekends, she&#39;s hostess in a bar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Okay. So you were living with your grandparents and you were enjoying being a kid in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. [laughs]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And going to school. Did you like school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you do well in school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh, Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m still studying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So when she brought you over, when you were in ninth grade or after ninth grade, did she have papers for you or did you cross the border?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I crossed with a visa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a visa?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourist?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tourist Visa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she put you into school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, she put me in school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you weren&#39;t happy?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I never was actually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were not?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you make friends?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few, but I entered high school until half of my second or my third year, I started making friends. My first year it was like I didn&#39;t have any friends. It was hard for me because I didn&#39;t speak the language that well. I understood because it was all in English. All my classes were in English. But I didn&#39;t speak it. So I was a really quiet person over there. So that was really hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you miss your grandparents?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, I did. Because they were like my mom and my dad. I grew up with them since I was born until I was 13, 14 years old. So it was really hard for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you miss your friends in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, I did. I did at first, but then time passed and I lost contact with them actually, so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how would you compare the schooling in Mexico and the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they put the students in the center in the US. They really care for you to learn, not just to get good grades. And that&#39;s the difference with Mexico. In Mexico you just need to get good grades. They don&#39;t care if you learned or if you&#39;re struggling with something else. They don&#39;t care. And in the US they try to help you. They are like more humane in that part. And in Mexico, they don&#39;t care. They&#39;re just like, &quot;I just need to get your grades and go home. And we don&#39;t care.&quot; That&#39;s the difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Did you do any extracurriculars, like sports or art or music?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took photography course and a music production course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With them . Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were those good?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, I really liked it. It helped me a little. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It helped you just adjust or make friends, or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, to adjust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be less lonely?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. To make a hobby out of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sure. Sure, sure. When you were there, it was just you and your mom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my stepdad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your stepdad?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was home life like? Did you do stuff with her, did you...?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I went to school, then I came back and my mom was always at home. My stepdad was always working. But I was kind of mad with them for taking me out of my Mexican life. So I didn&#39;t speak to them that much. There were certain times when I came to visit my grandparents, that was like really happy here. When I came back, I didn&#39;t talk at all with them. I wasn&#39;t like rude with them, but I was really quiet. I never spoke. I mean, if they asked me something, I was like, &quot;Yes, no.&quot; I didn&#39;t want it to make that connection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. So you actually had a visa that allowed you to go back and forth?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were there for four years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From like 14 to 18?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. Like 13, 14 to 18. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever drive a car there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, I never did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t think about that. Would your visa have allowed you to get a license?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you need to drive a car?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. My mom took me wherever I wanted to actually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So you finished high school, you graduated from high school and then you said, &quot;I&#39;m going back.&quot; How&#39;d that work out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I finished high school and then I wanted a year to clear off my mind, to take it like a vacation. When I told people here in Mexico that I live in the US they were like, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s so great.&quot; I was like, &quot;No, it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s really hard.&quot; But if you take </span><span class="c4">it as a </span><span class="c1">vacation, I think it helps. So my last year it was more like a vacation to me till I decided what I wanted to do. So my mom wanted me to go to college there, but I said, &quot;No, I&#39;m done.&quot; I mean, that&#39;s it. Like, I didn&#39;t have a really good relationship with my stepdad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I remember one day we got into a kind of fight and we started screaming at each other. And I said to my mom, &quot;You know I love you, but that&#39;s enough. I&#39;m going back. I don&#39;t care if you support me or not. I&#39;m going to do it. I did it your way now. I&#39;m doing it my way since you don&#39;t want to help me and I&#39;m gonna do it my way.&quot; So she understood me and she actually supported me at the end, so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me about your year long vacation. What did you do? It sounds great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah it does. Well, I just visited different place because I knew San Diego, but I only knew my commute. I didn&#39;t know, like the tourist places. So I visited the tourist places, the zoo, the Sea World, I don&rsquo;t know the beach. I went a lot to the beach. I took a course, a ESL course. And I met people from all over the world. Brazilian friends. I made Venezuelan friends, Argentina friends. Actually that was when I kind of started enjoying the US because I made friends, but they weren&#39;t only US friends. They were friends from all over the world and they have a similar backstory as mine. So that helped me because they were like, &quot;Oh, I miss home. I miss home.&quot; You have something to talk about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can connect with that people. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. That sounds like fun. So you went back. Did you ever get in trouble in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, I never do. You mean trouble, like legal trouble, or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No you didn&#39;t?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No. I was, like I told you, a really quiet person. So, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative). So when you came back to Mexico, did you move in back with your grandma</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. With my grandparents, but that was just for a few months. And then I started living with my aunt and an uncle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you go back to school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, I started college. Sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far are you in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a year. I still have a year. I graduate in a year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. How long have you been back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years. So has it been mostly going to school since you got back or did you go to work as well?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly school. I work, but freelance work. I haven&#39;t done anything formal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of freelance?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing, photography, that kind of stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you learned the photography in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. I started there. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. That&#39;s great. So what are you studying in school now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International business. I actually started in communications, but I changed to international business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been able to travel a lot with studying that at all?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet. Not yet, but I hope that that happens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one more year. And then do you go on to graduate school or do you just go to work after you&#39;ve graduated, do you think?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m still thinking about it. I don&#39;t know. I want to get a master&#39;s in advertising and I know it&#39;s not that related to international business. But you can make it work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like advertising a lot. I like marketing. I like all that publicity area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like it. So I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do when I finish college.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has it been hard to find the support for college? Like the money to keep you going?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well a little bit. Yeah. Because my mom supports me financially, but she has to pay for my school. She has to pay for my living, for my food, everything. And it&#39;s a little hard. Yeah. Economically it&#39;s hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But do you go visit her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. Whenever I have vacations, I go and I visit her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s nice to have the ability to come and go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. A lot of people don&#39;t have that, so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be really hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So how would you say... You&#39;ve been in both places, you obviously preferred Mexico to the United States. How would you compare the two cultures?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it&#39;s real different. The US is kind of like a melting pot where you have a lot of different cultures that are interacting with each other and that&#39;s cool, but I don&#39;t imagine myself living there, and in Mexico is different. I don&#39;t know how to say it. Like, we&#39;re all in the same channel. Even, if you say a joke to someone they&#39;ll understand it. And if you make that joke somewhere else, they&#39;re going to be like, &quot;What? What&#39;s that?&quot; That&#39;s one of the troubles I had when I got there, because I wanted to do the same jokes I did here. Talk the same way that I did here, and everything the same. But obviously it&#39;s not the same. But yeah, I think that&#39;s we&#39;re all in the same channel here in Mexico. And I like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like dreams, referring to what exactly?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dreams, your goals, what would you like to do with your life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still don&#39;t know yet, but I would like to get a good job. I would like to travel a lot and I have like, my wild dream is actually to become a musician, like a famous one. I actually have a band. Yeah. So that&#39;s-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of a band?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a rock band.

Not all of the songs, but I sing some songs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you write the songs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s like my</span><span class="c4 c5 c11">&nbsp;wild</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;dream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your wild dream?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c5">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.

Because I have school all week long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s a dream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.

I go out with someone. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, The music&#39;s the big dream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s my focus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s very, very exciting. Last question. Do you think being in the US for four years made you different than you are now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than you would have been if your... Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in what way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made me a completely different person. I mean, I was like really, not self-centered, but I didn&#39;t saw the big picture. I grew up with my grandparents in a really, like, strict home. I didn&#39;t go out too much because they didn&#39;t allow me to go out that much because of the insecurity and everything else. But when I went to the US everything was different. I met so many people from many different places that I realized that there&#39;s a whole world out there that I didn&#39;t knew about. I didn&#39;t care about. And today, like, nowadays I can realize there is so much more than you can just see in your city. I mean, traveling or living somewhere else, it changes you, like a lot. And it made me want more. Maybe in the future, I would like to travel, not just to the US. To different countries and learn more cultures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s the big thing I got from the US. Learning to interact with people from other cultures. I love that. It&#39;s pretty exciting. I think that that&#39;s the main thing that it changed in me. It opened up my eyes to a bigger picture that I didn&#39;t have when I lived here. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s great. Well, thank you so much for talking with us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isaid:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
