This is Anne, and I am interviewing Jos&eacute;. So Jos&eacute;, thank you so much for coming to talk to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, thank you for your time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah, I mean really thank you. We&#39;re here just to hear the stories about your experiences as a migrant in the U.S. and a returning migrant here. And I understand that it could be painful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is, I&#39;m sorry. But I think it&#39;s important to hear your story and I hope you feel that too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve told about what happened, or my story, to anybody. Not even my mom I think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, I left to the States because my mom, she got divorced and I have four sisters. So two older sisters, two younger sisters. My mom, basically, she couldn&#39;t afford to give us food, to give us what we needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were here in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was here in Mexico City. So basically what she did is we went to church. She knew a priest. So from that moment, I was at the age of nine I think, and she said, &quot;Okay, you&#39;re staying here and you have to do what the priest says.&quot; So basically, I needed to work, I did not go to school until I was about 11.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me about that. Why didn&#39;t you go to school until you were 11?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, basically my mom, she is very, very religious. She was afraid that maybe since she had already had her divorce that my dad would actually take us away. She was afraid that if she would send us to school, maybe at the end of the shift she wouldn&#39;t be able to be there and my dad would be able to be there and take us away. So basically that&#39;s why I did not go to school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I started going to school it was hard. I was 11 and I started first grade when kids six, seven years old they were in first grade and they would call me giant or things like that. I would feel bad about it. But I started hiding my feelings and just not minding what they would say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when I had the chance, the priest said, &quot;Okay, do you want to go to the States? You have a chance, you have an opportunity, and you will be able to get a better education.&quot; So I said yes. I had barely ended third grade and I went to States. It was really, really hard for me because I not only did not know algebra, I did not know science, I did not know history, I did not know nothing. I didn&#39;t know a word of English. So it was really hard because no one there spoke Spanish. Since I was in Idaho there wasn&#39;t very, there wasn&rsquo;t any Spanish-speaking people. So I had to learn with signs and just looking at them, how they would pronounce, things like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just backtracking a little bit. So your mom, when you were nine, she basically told some priest to start taking care of you. Did you go to live with the priest?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I did go there. There is a place, ____, like two towns away from there, there is a town called ____ and that&#39;s where I went. He had a church and there was a room that he gave me so I could stay there. Basically, I would have to be there every day. I would have to do anything he needed me to do. I would have to do pretty much all the chores there and everything. It was hard, it was very hard for me because I was too used to being with my mom. If my mom went to church I would go with her. If she went to store I would go with her. I was too used to being with my mom. When I left, when I went there I would cry every night because I missed my mom, I missed my sisters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, it&#39;s just like when I started school. I pretty much just tried to hide my feelings and I&#39;m actually a very quiet person. I don&#39;t usually tell what I feel and what I&#39;m going through. It&#39;s just like people say: if you smile, a lot of people won&#39;t even know what&#39;s going inside you, right? So yeah, that&#39;s pretty much how I ended up in the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so when you started school at 11, was it religious school, was it religiously affiliated?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it was a religious school. The priest that sent me, he would go to the States once a year and he knew the priest that I was going to be going with. So basically when I got there, there was pretty much it was a boys school and then there was a girls school. I was in the boys school. I would eat there, I would pray there, I would play, I would sleep. I would do everything there. So at the end, it was hard for me to actually leave Idaho because all my friends were there. From little, moving from one place to another and then starting everything all over. So it was very hard. But I guess there was a priest that would say, &quot;Such life.&quot; So basically I know that life is not easy, it&#39;s something that we have to work and we have to find out the best way to be happy, right? If you don&#39;t worry about yourself then nobody will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your mother left you with a priest when you were nine, did she come visit you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would go once a month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&#39;t close to her house?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it wasn&#39;t. It was very hard for her because even though she left me with the priest, she still had four daughters to take care of. And that&#39;s why she would only be able to go once a month and also it was about three hours away from home. So, paying for fare, going there, coming back, food, things like that. So I would only see her once a month. I would only see her for an hour. I wouldn&#39;t be able to have a full day with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was decided, I guess it wasn&#39;t your decision to go to the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was actually pretty much they pushed me away, or they pushed me to do so. If I would have stayed with my mom, maybe I would have said no, but since I was already with strangers, I was already with somebody I did not know, then I said yes because I want to do something with my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the expectation you were going to be a priest?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. At that moment, I was afraid of that priest because he would beat me up if I did something wrong. So I was very afraid of him. I said that would be much better than just staying here. So I said, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m leaving.&quot; The expectation when I got there, at first it was hard because I thought I would be there and I would be a priest, I would not be able to see my mom anymore, I wouldn&#39;t be able to see my family anymore. But then I realized that nobody could actually push me to do something that I did not want. So at that point, I just started to just try to feel calm and I just started... I wanted to learn English, I wanted to be able to communicate with my friends. I was a very competitive person. When I was here, I loved soccer and when I got there, they would play basketball, they would play American football and I did not know how to play that. So I consider myself a very competitive person, so I pushed myself to the limit actually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got there I was the worst player. Towards the middle. Then I started being one of the best. I like challenges. I know that if it&#39;s easy, then you don&#39;t feel good if you accomplish something, that it&#39;s easy. If it&#39;s a challenge, then once you complete the task, then you feel good with yourself because you completed something. It&#39;s something that wasn&#39;t given to you, it&#39;s something that you did with your own efforts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any memories of when you just showed up in the U.S., like when you got off the plane, or off the bus? Was it like, &quot;Whoa, what&#39;s going on?&quot; Do you have any memories?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I don&#39;t know. I just felt that when I got there it was going to be... when I got there actually I felt like I was in a different planet. I looked at the houses, everything was so different. Everything was so clean. People would respect, like for instance, when driving people would respect the limits. I was so in shock. I was so amazed. Since I got there when it was already snowing, so it was amazing. It was one of the best feelings in my life because I had never seen snow and when I was there, they give us a welcome and so we started doing a snowball fight. It was very, very... it was a beautiful feeling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowball fight. That&#39;s fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what was the school like once you got to the States? Was it very different than the schooling that you had in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was completely different. First thing, I didn&#39;t understand what they were telling me or what they wanted me to do. Second thing, starting here in third grade I did not learn a lot of math. That&#39;s something I needed to do to graduate there. So my first year was the worst in academic things, I remember they gave me the list of what I had made. For math, I had an F. For science I had... pretty much I had five different Fs. I had failed everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you were coming from third grade, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;re going into ninth?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into ninth, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I tell people, like my sisters, that that was something that I had to go through. I had to go from third grade to ninth grade and also learn English. They&#39;re like, &quot;No, no way. You did not do that.&quot; And things like that. But I had to learn. It&#39;s not just saying &quot;Okay, you were third grade, now you&#39;re ninth grade.&quot; No, you need to study, you need to pretty much make sure that you understand what the subject is because if you don&#39;t do it then you may be good for a few months. But after a while then you will drop down. You won&#39;t be able to know what&#39;s going on or what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was hard. During the first year, I studied a lot. I would stay at night. We would have to turn off the lights at 10, but I would put something under the door so they wouldn&#39;t be able to see the light. I would stay there studying, I would stay until 2, 3 a.m. Even though I had already been&hellip; because we would wake up at 6, 6:10. We would have to get ready for Mass, church, breakfast, and then start day of school. Then after that, about 3, we would have to do some chores. Then, about 4 we would have from 4 to 5 to do some study. Then from 5:30 we would do more prayers. And then we would do dinner, and then we would do more study, then more prayers, and then go to sleep. So our schedule was very tight. Even though, I did not give up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point I did want to give up, when I barely got there, because I wouldn&#39;t be able to understand anybody. The food was different. Then, so I basically had to learn to like the food there to be able to eat something, but at the end I loved the food there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you love?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lasagna. I love lasagna. I love&hellip; uhm&hellip; there&#39;s too many. There&#39;s too many different foods that I like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just like I was mentioning, the first year was the hardest. After the first year, then I started getting used to everything, the routine, and then after four years, after I graduated from high school, they said, &quot;Okay, well you have to go to the major &nbsp;seminary now because you don&#39;t know if you have vocation.&quot; At that moment, I said, &quot;Okay, well I&#39;m going to try it.&quot; The place where I was living at, there wasn&#39;t a lot of people. We were living in Idaho. So it was like a mountain, and there wasn&#39;t a lot of houses, there wasn&#39;t a lot of people. So at that moment, I said, &quot;Okay, well I&#39;m going to try it out.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Nebraska for about four months but I realized I did not have the vocation, so I told them, I said, &quot;Well, I feel that I don&#39;t have this vocation, that this is not for me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you realize that? Certainly you had been going along that path for a while, and maybe you had doubts early on. But what finally made you decide?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one girl I liked very much. I think that&#39;s what made me realize that I could not have a vocation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you meet her? It seems like you probably didn&#39;t have a lot of opportunities to meet women, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. During the time I was in a minor seminary, even though we weren&#39;t allowed to go with the girls at the other school, there were some times where we came together, like let&#39;s say football game or basketball game. So they would go to cheer us, since we would play against a different school. So, I don&#39;t know. Since the first moment I saw her I thought that she was the most beautiful girl in the whole universe. We would talk once in a while. Not like a lot of time, but we would talk once in a while. Before I left to the major seminary, I told her that I liked her and she said that she liked me too. I said, &quot;Well, maybe then I&#39;m not going to a major seminary.&quot; She said, &quot;No, go to the major seminary and stay a few months. If you really decide that it&#39;s not your vocation then, then fine. We can talk and we can see what&#39;s going on.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I went and once I said I don&#39;t have a vocation, once I came back, I realized that&mdash;or I talked to her through Facebook, or not to her, I talked to her sister. She told me that she was already married with another guy. So I was depressed for a few months. But then I had realized that maybe she wasn&#39;t for me and I needed to move on. Until now I still talk to her sister, but she doesn&#39;t talk to me. She now has three babies. So that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it seemed like it was a natural decision to stay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly, they were grooming you to be a priest and once you didn&#39;t want to be a priest, they were like, &quot;We can&#39;t keep you anymore.&quot; So was there any option to stay in the United States for you do you think?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried. But no, they said, &quot;Either you go back or we have to keep your passport and visa.&quot; So I said, &quot;No, I&#39;ll just go back.&quot; Then since my visa and passport was still valid, when I checked, I checked at the embassy, and I don&#39;t know, they did something that I couldn&#39;t go back as&hellip;to States. So I did not try anymore. I said, okay, I&#39;m just going to stay here, I&#39;m going to try to work my very best, my very hardest and since then I&#39;ve been working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you came back to Mexico, did you go to live with your mother?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived with my mom for about three months then I went to rent a little house. Then I do see my mom once a month, but it&#39;s not very often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you bitter that she sent you to the priest?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think a little bit. I love my mom. I know she did what she did because she thought it was the best. But she never asked me if I wanted that. So I talked to her but I think there is still a little something there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see your sisters?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you came back to look for a job, you decided on TeleTech?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I actually tried TeleTech, the one that&#39;s right next. But I didn&#39;t stay because I didn&#39;t have experience. So they said, &quot;No, we need somebody with experience.&quot; So since I didn&#39;t stay there I went with one of my uncles and I worked as a driver for about a month. Then I said, I need to try it again. So I came back, I tried one more time. Even though they had told me a month before that I did not have experience, I did the exams and the interviews and I got the job. So I started there, I worked there for about two years and I was very excited because I was able to get in without the experience. Even though the first time they had told me that I needed the experience. But since then I&#39;ve been working call centers. I&#39;ve been in about three call centers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you said in the survey that you had hoped to continue your studies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you said your papers from the seminary, there&#39;s no way to get them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been trying to get in touch with the secretary to see if they could send it. They told me that if they sent the apostille, then I would be able to validate them here. But I guess she&#39;s been very busy and she hasn&#39;t been able to get to that yet. But I&#39;m actually, like every week, I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey, how are you doing?&quot; And she&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m working on it!&quot; But until then I still don&#39;t have no papers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of studying do you think you would like to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the States, I wanted to be a detective. I like investigation. When I got here I know that being a detective is not what I want to do here. Maybe something to do with computers. I&#39;m not sure exactly what I want to do. There&#39;s a couple of options that I want to try out and that I want to work on, or that I want to study. But first, I wanted to get all my papers down to make sure that once I have my papers, I will be able to start studying something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds great. You said you have a child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl or a boy?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a girl. She&#39;s two years old. She&#39;s my life. Yes. When I get home, she&#39;ll like, &quot;Daddy! Daddy!&quot; I like to work because as I mentioned, I like to earn my own things. But when I get back home after a hard day of work, I like spending time with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her mother does not live with you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just you and her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that tough, just providing? She&#39;s only two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it&#39;s tough. At first, there wasn&#39;t anybody who I could leave my daughter with. She needed to have a lot of attention. She was very little. So I talked with my sister, so she takes care of her when I&#39;m at work. But yes, it&#39;s tough being a parent. I like it, it&#39;s tough, it&#39;s a challenge, but I like it. I feel that I&#39;m so happy with her and I want to give her what I did not have. I&#39;m not planning on just giving or just doing everything for her. But I&#39;m planning on communicating with her and I want to make sure that what I choose for her or what she chooses is because we had already discussed it and because she really wants that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. So when you think back on your time in the U.S., do you think that living there for the five years that you did changed you and made you different than if you had stayed in Mexico City all your life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it did. When I came back, or now that I think of it, I could remember a couple of friends that were with me and they&#39;re both dead. So I feel that if I would have stayed maybe I would be... I don&#39;t know, I would have become somebody I do not want to think of right now. Or maybe I would have done things that I would be regretting. So I feel that going to the States and having that routine, even though there was a lot of things that I did not have there, like my family, but I did have a routine that made me responsible for my actions. Made me responsible for what I wanted and for what I needed. So I feel that those five years that I was there has made the difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there things that you miss? Like tangible things?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, tangible things that you miss? Besides lasagna?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I miss going to ski, skiing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, you were in Idaho.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I would go skiing every weekend. I miss that. I miss my friends. I miss sports. Since I came back, since I started working I haven&#39;t done a lot of sports. But I&#39;m a very sporty person. I love all types of sports and when I was there I would play every day. I would play for hours. So I miss playing basketball, I miss playing soccer. I miss&hellip; I miss just talking with my friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there things you don&#39;t miss?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things I don&#39;t miss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there things that you just as soon forget about?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that being there, I don&#39;t think so. I think when I was there mostly the things that I had... of course it was hard but I loved going to school. I loved that I needed to do activities. That kept me busy and not having to remember all the time my family. When I went with the first priest, even though I did have to do things there was a lot of times that I had a lot of time. In those times, I would think of my family and I would cry because I would miss them. So when I was in the States that was different because all the time I was doing something. So that made me the person that I am and I don&#39;t think I regret anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. You must be very smart to have gotten through high school after only having a third grade education.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think to myself and I say... I love learning a lot of things and even though I learned English and even though I went from third grade to ninth grade and finished high school, I feel that I could learn a lot of things but I still think there is a lot of people there that are much more intelligent. As I said, I&#39;m that type of a competitive type of person. So yes, at school, even though I was the first Spanish-speaking person there, I graduated and I would check my grades and everything would be A. A+, A-, As. So I feel that I want to go back to school and that I still have much more to give and that I don&#39;t just want to be somebody that just finished high school. But I want to be somebody that has a career and that has something to achieve. Something more to achieve.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I&#39;m competitive, I&#39;m not that type of person that I like to show off or things like that. I thank you for thinking that, but I just want to go back to school. I want to keep going, finish a career and give better life to my daughter, to my family and to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working in the call centers, will that allow you, when you get your papers, to support yourself while you&#39;re going to school, do you think? Is that something that&#39;s a possibility?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I&#39;m planning, if there isn&#39;t a way of going directly to school, doing it online. I think of myself in the past I would stay at night to study. So now it won&#39;t be different. After work, at night, I could do my studies, if I need to do any exams or whatever it is. But I feel that nothing is impossible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great, that&rsquo;s great. Do you think you&#39;ll go back to the U.S?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m working on getting my papers, then getting a career. And then once I have a career, I would like to get back. If it were possible I would like to get a visa, passport and go back. But that&#39;s a dream. That&#39;s something that I am working for. But at the same time, I&#39;m a realistic person as well. I know that if there isn&#39;t a way, then that&#39;s not going to destroy my goals and what I want for my daughter. Because I know I have already lived a lot. I&#39;ve already gone through 27 years of life, but she&#39;s only two so I want to make sure that either if it&#39;s in the States or if it&#39;s here, that she is happy with what her decisions are and of course, making sure that she has&mdash;get an education.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You feel that you can raise her in a safe environment here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, there is a lot of bad people, but at the same time there is a lot of good people. So if it&#39;s here, then I&#39;m sure there is somewhere that I could raise my daughter and I could protect her. Even if I try to go to the safest place, there would be people that would try to do wrong. So I will try my very best to protect her from that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So, often I ask people do you regret having gone to the U.S. Well, you didn&#39;t make that choice and it seems that your experiences were very good. Is there anything that you would like&mdash;so we&#39;re going to do this report, we&#39;re hoping it gets read by lots of people in the United States and in Mexico, we&#39;re trying to show people the stories of these returning migrants. Is there something that you would like people to know about you and your experiences and your story that you haven&#39;t said already?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that I could think of right now. I can&#39;t think of anything right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. I have a tangential question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still go to church?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still believe. But I don&#39;t go that often. I do go, I don&#39;t go like every Sunday because it&#39;s very hard for me with work and with my daughter. But I do believe and I do go once in a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good. It sounds like it was a tough road to hoe, though, for a while there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it sounds like you are very adaptable. I mean, you adapted to some very strenuous situations and thrived. It&#39;s very impressive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I wish you the best of luck. I think that you probably have a pretty bright future ahead of you. Get those papers&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;and maybe you&#39;ll be able to get back to the U.S.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was great interviewing you, and thank you so much for being here.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Jos&eacute;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Thank you for your time once again.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
