Great. So, before you migrated &nbsp;to the US did you go to school in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you work in Mexico before </span><span>you went to</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.Why did you migrate to the United States? So we have economic reasons, violence, discrimination, reunite with family, or other?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other. My dad and my mom took us to the states when I was only six months old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Was your family decision motivated by economic reasons or something else?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well yeah probably more of a family reunite because most of my dad&#39;s side of the family was already over there. So my dad decided to take my mom and me and my older sister over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you said you were six.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months old. Okay. So your personal reasons are not yet developed. I got you. Skip that. You mentioned you were six months old. And how did your family enter the </span><span>United states</span><span class="c2 c0">? We have tourist visa, migrant visa or across the border.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crossed the border.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was both your parents, your sister, and you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you or your family apply for political asylum when you got to the US? It&#39;s kind of like when you get to the US you try to claim refugee status.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Alright. And then, did you become a US resident?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then how old... You were six months old so your English was not </span><span>good</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at six months old when you first got there. But then I&#39;m assuming you learned English while you were in the US. [laughs</span><span>]</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well my first language was English, actually, because my parents were learning how to speak so they wouldn&#39;t talk to us in English at length</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when they learn how to speak English they were like, </span><span>&ldquo;O</span><span class="c0">kay, outside the house you get to speak all the English you want, but inside my house you speak Spanish.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;So that way we got both languages really good. So that was really good for us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your parents really put some thought into making sure you</span><span>&rsquo;d</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;learn both. That&#39;s really cool. How&#39;d you learn English, we&#39;ll say in the community, with your family, and then would you say also at school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you take any specific courses for English?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None. Just went into school and I was already speaking a little bit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, how would you describe your English language skills now? I would say fluent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talk so fast. If you can understand mine</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re definitely fluent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you mentioned that you lived in Nevada. Where in Nevada?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Reno</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anywhere else?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived also in</span><span>&nbsp;San Jose, </span><span class="c0">California for two years and </span><span>Fort Bragg,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;California, for a year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Jose, California. And the second one is </span><span>Fort Bragg</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;in California</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far did you get with your schooling in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I went all the way to ninth grade, I was in tenth when I dropped out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, did you finish tenth grade, midway through?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midway through it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you work at all in the United </span><span>States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes</span><span>,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;I did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many years did you work?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I was probably, let&#39;s say going to be 14 when I started working,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then from there you worked until.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until I came over here. I was 22.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#39;s see. So that would be eight years. I pulled up the calculator</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What jobs did you have?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked in a couple fast food restaurants. I also helped out my mom and my aunt working in their company. They had a house cleaning company and cleaned offices and warehouses </span><span>and worked</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;at restaurants. I had a lot of jobs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know</span><span>. </span><span class="c2 c0">And that was starting at 14. So did you have to say you were older then, for the job? Did they believe you or did they care?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first job was actually at a Wendy&#39;s and they actually made me </span><span>get</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;permission from school so I could work there and they were only giving me four hours. Because my dad, when we started school, he applied for us to get social security cards that would let us actually study. So we were using that to study. The only thing we couldn&#39;t do with it was work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s interesting. And so you can get social security cards for your children? </span><span>J</span><span class="c2 c0">ust to go to school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s what he did when we were babies, when we first started school, me and my older sister. How he did it, </span><span>I</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;have no idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your parents, did they </span><span>come with t</span><span class="c2 c0">he documentation, did they get all the documentation?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well my dad became a citizen, no he became resident. He is going to become a citizen. He had a few problems. They took it all </span><span>away from him</span><span class="c0">. But he was a citizen when we got </span><span>there, a</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;couple years after we got there he became a resident, sorry. And so he got us permission to go to school. So he got us those social security cards. But supposedly they were legal because they were taking them in school and everything but on the back of them it said that we couldn&#39;t use them for work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you </span><span>had</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;to work out deals in order to work at that age.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then do you remember for the last job you had in the United States, about how much you were paid for an hour?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was working, where was I working? I believe I was working at a bar</span><span>-</span><span class="c2 c0">restaurant type deal and I was making a hundred a day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred dollars a day?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tips included afterward </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes sense, So you mentioned you lived with your parents in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my parents and my siblings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your siblings. Any other relatives?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a bunch of other family there but I lived with two sisters, three brothers and my mom and my dad. Pretty big family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they older, younger?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an older sister. I&#39;m the second of seven.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re the second oldest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a lot of responsibility for the younger children as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then during this time in the US were you at all frightened of US authorities?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest I wasn&#39;t. I wasn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that was?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I felt okay there because I never saw anything really happening. There was one time when they were doing the Obama raids stuff like that, I was there. And in Reno they were doing it. A couple people were scared and then I was like </span><span>&ldquo;N</span><span class="c0">ah</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">, I was still going out and doing my thing. I didn&#39;t think anything was going to happen. And I noticed that they would go more towards the people that couldn&#39;t really speak English and stuff like that. So I was like </span><span>&ldquo;W</span><span class="c0">hoa I could </span><span>talk to them</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like nothing,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;but you never know. I wasn&#39;t really scared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No outside. That makes sense where they take those characteristics and they try to target people. Did you or your family send money to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom used to send money to my grandparents all the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times would you say per year?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was sending it every two weeks you can say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how much each time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the most 100 dollars every 15 days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you lived in the United States for 22 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And during this time did you follow US political news and stuff?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don&#39;t want to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During your time in the US did you follow any Mexican political </span><span>news</span><span class="c2 c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What caused you to leave the United States? </span><span>You or</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;my family made the decision, I was obtained and deported, I was given voluntary departure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made the decision on my own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you appear before a judge or anything?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you made the decision on your own, you weren&#39;t greeted by any authorities or representatives</span><span>?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you able to connect with any family in Mexico when you returned?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, my sisters. I still communicate with all of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&#39;re in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>No, they&#39;re</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;in the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you returned to Mexico did you have any family ?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah. My mom was already here. I came down to visit her and we just ended up staying here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sayulita?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lives four hours away from here, but then I decided to come to Sayulita because they told me there was good paying jobs. My mom lives in a really really small town. It&#39;s mainly family, dirt roads. It&#39;s probably six blocks, the whole town. It&#39;s really really small. There was only field work, stuff like that so I was working their watermelon. Getting $150 a day. Making 10 hours, 11 hours shifts and that was hard. S</span><span>o</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;I did that for two years and then my uncle told me to come here to Sayulita and I&#39;ve been here ever since.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you been back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been here eight years now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight years. So you live in Sayulita now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I live here in Sayulita.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s still in Nayarit?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Nayarit </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you </span><span>came to live with who?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No I came down here because of my uncle but right now I live with my daughter and my husband.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you have been back in the United States did you pursue any studies in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No</span><span>, I haven&rsquo;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You offered good pay since you&#39;ve been back. And for jobs you mentioned you worked </span><span>on </span><span class="c2 c0">watermelon fields.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With watermelons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say caf&eacute;, restaurants.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restaurants were mainly my thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh so you&#39;re doing this on top of other jobs?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably my fifth job here, but I&#39;ve been bouncing around from restaurant to restaurant seeing which one pays better to be honest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that&#39;s smart. Absolutely. Trying to figure out which one</span><span>&nbsp;offers the</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;tips and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. Have you found this </span><span>one pretty</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;good?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one&#39;s actually been really good. This one&#39;s actually really good. He&#39;s probably one of the persons that pay the most. He pays by the hour. Mostly everybody else pays, at the most, for a waiter $200 a day and your tips are completely separate from everything. But he pays, starting, 35 pesos an hour which is pretty good, because if you make extra hours you&#39;re already paid more. Other places you make extra hours but you&#39;re still getting your $200.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I </span><span>bet during peak</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>season there is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a lot of traffic. Okay you&#39;ve spelled this out how much you get paid for your </span><span>current job</span><span class="c2 c0">, you said 35 pesos an hour.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get paid right now $38 an hour.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Per hour. Do you feel safe in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you say that for all of Mexico or this particular area?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I would say that for most of Mexico. For most.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. Have you been a victim of any sort of crime in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c0">never.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant because of your English or your experience in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually feel stronger with my English and me being from some other place that I have a little bit more experience than most of the people </span><span>around</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;here. Most of the people </span><span>around</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;here, this is a small town so they&#39;re more closed minded. I feel like I </span><span>have a little</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;bit more experience, I can do a little bit more with my English. It&#39;s helped me out here because of the tourism and stuff like that so I </span><span>feel a little</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;bit stronger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s an advantage. And you mentioned you still have family living in the United States. Are your sisters and your father?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sisters and all my dad&#39;s side of the family live there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let&#39;s say siblings and other. Is your dad in there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad&#39;s in Tijuana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&#39;ll say siblings and other. Are any of your relatives US citizens?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ones?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my younger sister and three brothers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister and three brothers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then my dad&#39;s whole side of the family. Cousins, uncles, aunts, they&#39;re all US citizens. My daughter </span><span>is a US</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;citizen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. And now because you&#39;re the oldest </span><span>ones,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;then their family migrated and they were born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my older sister and I are the only ones that aren&#39;t citizens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have they come to visit you here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My younger sister has.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have any of them come to live in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well actually I have three brothers that live </span><span>here that</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;are younger than me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are any in the US considering coming to live in Mexico or mostly just visit?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just visit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you currently follow US news?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve kind of sort of, not big in news like </span><span>that. I</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;check it out because of all the drama that&#39;s going on. Especially with the kids, everything that&#39;s happening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know. We&#39;ve been here while it&#39;s been happening. It&#39;s so shameful to just be an American.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s really bad. We can&#39;t do anything about it. You guys can&#39;t do anything about it. Or maybe we can, if everybody gets united, maybe something will actually happen. But that&#39;s not your</span><span>&nbsp;guys&rsquo; fault</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Collective yes, because we&#39;re voting, but yes I think on a very small level. But I think that&#39;s also why I think doing projects like this are important because when you do get a lot of voices together, it does become a lot louder and we hope to put this on a bigger platform. And make it a larger thing to just change the rhetoric that&#39;s just been going on. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you do see US news here is that mostly family, friends, social media?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social media.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social media. For social media is that Facebook?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah Facebook. Sometimes on T.V.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On T.V. as well. Do you think you&#39;ll return to the United States someday?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m hoping, but to do it all the right way. I can&#39;t just go jump in there because I don&#39;t have citizenship, residence or anything. But my daughter is a US citizen and I&#39;d really really like for her to go to school there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely yeah. We don&#39;t have that as an option. I&#39;m going to put family unification. But I think that&#39;s a really good point that a lot of it </span><span>is an opportunity</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;for your child who is a US citizen but can&#39;t go to school there. Do you currently participate or volunteer in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&#39;m going to send it </span><span>back,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and just some follow-up questions. Less formal than the yes or no survey ones. You mentioned you moved or migrated to the US when you were six months old, but I doubt you remember much of the passage. Can you tell me just about your childhood growing up in the US? Do you feel maybe more American? What was school like? Your friends, your neighborhood? Anything like that</span><span>?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me it was actually a good childhood up there.</span><span>&nbsp;M</span><span class="c0">y dad&#39;s whole side of the family was up there and we were very united. It was so easy for us. As a child. my dad would never tell me </span><span>&ldquo;no&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in anything. So it was really easy to get toys and have fun and go out in the parks and everything over there. It was actually a good childhood. My school, I loved going to </span><span>school. I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was a great student and everything but when I got older, I was just thinking. I was always really into school then I was like</span><span>, &ldquo;W</span><span class="c0">ait I&#39;m illegal. I don&rsquo;t know </span><span>if I keep</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;going to school, keep getting into it. What&#39;s going to happen when I graduate high school? What&#39;s going to happen when I try to go to college? Are they going to let me go? What&#39;s going to happen?</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s kind of where it threw me off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you say, since you didn&#39;t have documentation to go to college</span><span>, d</span><span class="c2 c0">id that hurt your motivation at school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only imagine. I </span><span>had</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a hard </span><span>time </span><span class="c0">motivating and I know I can go to college, let alone push you </span><span>to read an</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;education book. You were saying great student, loved school, great grades.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, out of all my siblings, I was the best one at school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have any teacher in particular?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember Mr. Rodriguez in middle school, sixth grade in San Jose, California. He was my math teacher and since I&#39;ve always been great with numbers and I&#39;ve always loved math. I&#39;m always going to remember him. He was always great with us. He was one of those fun teachers. Just playing around with the math gets you more interested in it and it was actually pretty good. He was great. He was a great teacher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he ever talk to you about things outside of math? Do you have any specific moments with him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was times where things would break down with friends and he would be down. He was always that type of teacher like</span><span>, &ldquo;C</span><span class="c0">ome here. Talk to me. What&#39;s going on</span><span>?&rdquo; </span><span class="c2 c0">He would see that you were doing something, that you were going low on your work and stuff and something&#39;s wrong. He was always really on it with his students. His family is from Mexico. So he was Mexican but he was a US citizen. He was one of my only teachers that was actually licensed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like he really made an effort to make you feel welcomed and special and heard and noticed. When you find a teacher like that</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c0">you never forget them. They&#39;re really special.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest they are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of your friend groups. Going all the way to tenth grade with different friends. What were your friends like, do you have moments with some?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some crazy moments. Up until middle school I was still doing really good in school but when it hit high school, that&#39;s when I started to drop a little bit. Started hanging out a little bit more with friends and going out and stuff like that and I remember my friends were mostly all from elementary to high school. And I had some really really good friends. Still keep in contact with them and everything. They keep tellIng me</span><span>, &ldquo;When am I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;going to go back</span><span>?&rdquo; </span><span class="c2 c0">Come over here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you tell them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I literally tell everybody to come over here. I tell them</span><span>, &ldquo;C</span><span class="c0">ome check it out, this is great and you guys are going to see why I don&#39;t want to go back.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;To be honest I really love to go visit because I have so much family there. To tell you the truth I don&#39;t think I would be able to live in the States anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After living in Sayulita.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just from my short time here, I&#39;m starting to understand why you feel that way. I feel like you feel very strongly about living in Mexico now. Do you feel more American or more Mexican? You grew up in America.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes feel more American because of my habits and me being over there for so long. I can&#39;t really say I&#39;m 100 percent Mexican, because there&#39;s still some traditions that I do like any American.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22 years is something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah it&#39;s more than</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">I have, so I can respect that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I celebrate Thanksgiving here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wow. How do you celebrate Thanksgiving?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my friends. I have a lot of friends that are from the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a friend that&#39;s from Fresno. My husband&#39;s from Arizona. His cousin&#39;s from Arizona.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they born in Mexico before they lived in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My husband and his cousin were born here and my husband actually went to the States. He was only 14 years old. He left without any family over there, anything. He just decided to go for it. It was a hard life for him. His cousin, they took him when he was a baby also. So he grew up in the States and they actually sent him out. It was pretty hard on him. And then I have my friend that&#39;s from Fresno. She was born in Fresno but it was backwards with her. They brought her down when she was a baby so she was raised here, but she was born in Fresno. So she goes back and forth. You talk to her and she has an accent. English was her second language. She went when she was probably like in middle school to the States and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;ll celebrate Thanksgiving together?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We celebrate Thanksgiving. We do the whole turkey thing and everything. We celebrate more Halloween than we do </span><span class="c5 c0">Dia de los </span><span class="c5">Muertos</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;(All Soul&rsquo;s Day).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us it&#39;s more</span><span>, &ldquo;H</span><span class="c0">ey, let&#39;s go to the club, let&#39;s do this huge party for Halloween.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;And we get all dressed up and everything. It&#39;s more traditions from the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you mentioned habits as well that were more American.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m talking about the cooking and all that stuff. I&rsquo;m not really into, I mean love Mexican food and it&#39;s great, but I still have that American style</span><span>, like </span><span class="c2 c0">the hamburgers, hotdogs and stuff. Everything that you get there from the fast food restaurants. Oh yeah. That&#39;s me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Ruben&#39;s has some more American style food in town.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And sometimes I go to Carl&#39;s Junior, order the </span><span>P</span><span class="c0">eewee just to get a hamburger, you know? It doesn&#39;t the same. It doesn&#39;t. It does </span><span class="c5 c0">not </span><span class="c0">taste the same. But at least I&#39;m getting a little taste of... Today I&#39;m going to make some tacos and you know the tacos from Jack in the Box</span><span>? The 99 cent tacos? </span><span class="c0">Those are the bomb. So I told my daughter</span><span>, &ldquo;I&#39;m</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;going to get some ground beef and I&#39;m going to get some cheese and I&#39;m going to get this and I&#39;m going to make some tacos because I miss those tacos.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about style. That&#39;s so funny. In Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making American style fast food tacos. That&#39;s incredible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a couple of things. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. There&#39;s this thing,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">in my mom&#39;s hometown, they&#39;re a little bit more close</span><span>-</span><span class="c0">minded. For them, for a girl to go there, and go to the beach with everybody there</span><span>&nbsp;w</span><span class="c0">earing a bathing suit, that&#39;s super offensive to them. You go over there and you see the girls, teenage girls, or the ladies wearing shorts and a t-shirt. You would hardly ever see them in a bathing suit. So I get here, I</span><span>&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Okay, </span><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know any of this.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;So they&#39;re like </span><span>&ldquo;O</span><span class="c0">h we&#39;re going to go down to the beach for </span><span>Semana Santa,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;this and that. So I throw on my bathing suit and I go and everybody&#39;s just like</span><span>, &ldquo;Oh my god, </span><span class="c0">did you see her? She&#39;s naked.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It</span><span>&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Mom, who&#39;s </span><span>everybody?&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And she&#39;s like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">it&#39;s because they&#39;re not used to it.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I was like</span><span>, &ldquo;O</span><span class="c0">h, but we&#39;re at the beach</span><span>!&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;There&#39;s things that I still get stuck with my Spanish even though my parents were on it. I get really stuck on it. I turn to my mom or my boss always corrects me. If I say something wrong, just by one letter, cause I know the word but to pronounce it I&#39;m sometimes I&#39;m off. He&#39;s lik</span><span>e, &ldquo;Y</span><span class="c0">ou&#39;re saying it wrong.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Really? So I still get stuck and it&#39;s been eight years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I talk English. She&#39;s still getting the hang of it, but my husband speaks English so I&#39;m more talking in English </span><span>and stuff like that here</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you hope your daughter will as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re trying. She&#39;s a tough one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom&#39;s Portuguese and she tried so hard to get my sister and I to speak Portuguese and we&#39;re just like what&#39;s that gibberish? </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She understands it and she can speak it a little bit. But she&#39;s all like </span><span>&ldquo;H</span><span class="c0">uh? </span><span>W</span><span class="c0">hat are you talking about?</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;But I&rsquo;ve caught her. Sometimes I&#39;m talking to </span><span>my husband</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;then all of a sudden he leaves and she&#39;s like</span><span>, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Mom, were you talking about this and thi</span><span>s?&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;So my goodness, man, you&#39;re just acting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she&#39;s a citizen so I really want her to understand everything. Like I told you, I feel like this is a really really safe place and I feel it more for her. She could go to and from school walking and school is pretty far from here. She goes to the park. She goes down to the beach and everybody around her, mostly everybody knows each other. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Oh, your daughter was just at the park, oh, this</span><span>.&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;I know in the States she&#39;d be mostly inside, watching TV., not being able to go to the park on her own and stuff like that. For her it&#39;d be kind of difficult to go right now as a kid, because down here the kids are so free.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s another main reason why I wouldn&#39;t want to go to the States right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just from my short time in Sayulita it just feels like the community takes care of the kids when they&#39;re around. </span><span>It s</span><span class="c0">eems like a fantastic place to grow up. So I understand why you want that. But then you were saying she gets older, the school system in the US might be</span><span>?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school system in the US is way better than here, to be honest. I have a really hard time in school for her. It&#39;s so different. Here most of the stuff, you get it online. Teachers are like</span><span>, &ldquo;L</span><span class="c0">ook this up. Google this. Do this.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And everything&#39;s online. You have these questions, look for them online. And they just get the answers, copy them off the internet, write it down and turn in the homework and they&#39;re good. When I was growing up in the </span><span>States</span><span class="c0">, they give you hard</span><span>-</span><span class="c0">book textbooks and then you have to read the whole thing and you have to answer it in your own words. If you look it up on the internet, you have to put it in your own words. You can&#39;t just copy it off of there. You are actually learning. Here, I feel the kids</span><span>&nbsp;are like, &ldquo;Okay,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;just look it up, write it down.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>Th</span><span class="c2 c0">ey&#39;re not reading, even what they&#39;re writing down or anything. They&#39;re just writing it down. Turning it in. And okay we got a good grade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So most of the time I was like</span><span>, &ldquo;U</span><span class="c0">h-uh. Read that and check it out and if you don&#39;t understand, ask me and we&#39;ll sit down and we&#39;ll check it out.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;For me, that&#39;s not right. Teachers are supposed to be there to show you how to do it, not just give you homework and just check it out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should build curiosity as a student.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My husband didn&#39;t let me send her right now when she&#39;s small and I understand, she&#39;s still too young. But I&#39;m trying to see if I could send her </span><span>starting</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;middle school so she can start studying up there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would you send her with your family?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be your sisters? Kind of hard to not have her with you though, but I totally respect prioritizing her education and trying to do what&#39;s best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s kind of hard for me to think of it that way, and I&#39;ve been putting it off on my own. My sister wants me to send her for Christmas break. And she&#39;s like, </span><span>&ldquo;D</span><span class="c0">id you get the passport already? Did you get the passport already?</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And I&#39;m like</span><span>, &ldquo;N</span><span class="c0">o I haven&#39;t.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;It&#39;s not because I don&#39;t want her to go over there. It&#39;s just always been me and her. So it&#39;s tough on me to be away from her but like you just said, her education is everything. She&#39;s everything. So, I want the best for her. Going to school in the States, being able to go to high school, being able to go to college in the States, I think it&#39;s way better than being here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like</span><span>&nbsp;you have planned </span><span class="c2 c0">her education and her future in the states. Looking back on your own experience, is there anything you would&#39;ve done differently?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. There&#39;s a lot. I would&#39;ve kept going to school. Even though I had that doubt. I didn&#39;t know what was going to happen after I graduated from high school. If I could go back now, I would keep going. See what else I could do. It was pretty tough. It was pretty tough. I see my sister and my brother that were born in the States and other people that I know that don&#39;t see the opportunity they have and they don&#39;t take it and they just blow it off. You have everything. You&#39;re a US citizen. You can keep studying. It&#39;s going to be probably a little bit of money you&#39;re going to spend on college</span><span>,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;but it&#39;s for your own good and you&#39;re just blowing it off. If I had the opportunity, I would&#39;ve gone for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s </span><span>why</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I think a lot of Mexicans or Latinos that have gone to the States and are back over here now. </span><span>We</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;see so many people that were born there and that have the opportunity but they don&#39;t take it, and we&#39;re like, </span><span>&ldquo;I</span><span class="c0">f you don&#39;t want I want it. If we were able to have it, we would do it.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;It&#39;s sad to see that. It&#39;s really sad. It&#39;s disappointing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. I know for the people who we have talked to who are in that position of being able to pursue a higher degree in the United States, a lot of them still feel put down in the States because of racial profiling. There&#39;s a lot of opportunity, there&#39;s also a lot of negativity, especially around migrants from Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that&#39;s where they have the opportunity to prove them wrong. They have that opportunity. If you want to go for it that way, I&#39;m going to prove you wrong. I&#39;m going to prove that I can do something. Not because my parents were illegal means that I&#39;m not able to do something better than you. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve always said to my sister</span><span>, &ldquo;J</span><span class="c0">ust keep going,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;right now she finally went back to school. I think she just got her high school degree. She&#39;s 28 and I think she&#39;s starting to go to community college. So I&#39;m happy for her. I told my brother</span><span>, &ldquo;K</span><span class="c0">eep going for it, don&#39;t stop. That&#39;s what I want for my daughter. </span><span>That&#39;s what I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;would&#39;ve wanted for me.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially being a top student. Knowing that you can do that. Having that belief and that&#39;s really, really powerful. So you mention the opportunity, what&#39;s good in the US? Do you think you talk about what was difficult, difficult for you, for your family living in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to rent a place for us, a house for us, because my mom was illegal. It was hard for her to get a good</span><span>-</span><span class="c0">paying job because she was always a very hard worker. But most of the places that she would get a job, they wouldn&#39;t pay her the right amount because of the fact that she was illegal. They were basically like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">I&#39;m doing you a favor.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploiting her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s until my aunt got her company, housekeeping, and she brought my mom into it and so it was a bigger opportunity for my mom. So for me, not being able to rent out my own place because I had to present legal documents and stuff like that, it was kind of tough, for me getting a good paying job. I was working at restaurants that my uncles owned without putting in any paperwork or anything like that and working with my aunt in housekeeping where I didn&#39;t have to do any of that so they were basically paying me through my mom or through my aunt and that&#39;s how I was receiving my money. It was hard. It was hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like your family adapted by creating their own businesses so that others can&#39;t take advantage of them, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s also very difficult to also do without the proper paperwork.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was. It was very difficult</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You </span><span>also mentioned</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;a passion for math and numbers. I&#39;m sure that helps in your jobs now as well, but do you ever think of pursuing your studies now or maybe once...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be more on the numbers side. I really, really want to do my own business, baking. I love baking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of baking?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking, if I get the opportunity to and I hope I do and I&#39;m saving up my money for it. Here I have that opportunity to open my own business. Making </span><span>D</span><span class="c2 c0">anishes and cupcakes and pies, added with coffee and stuff like that. I&#39;d probably put a place like this and have different styles of pies and cupcakes and just tables and coffee secondary, but where people can actually just relax and have a piece of pie and some coffee. Something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like a dream to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My husband&#39;s a chef. I love baking and I know how to cook and my mom&#39;s a great cook so we&#39;re thinking of putting something together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to study, I want to go, I want to finish high school, I want to get a course on desserts, kitchen and all that stuff. I&#39;m hoping to go through with that. Owning your own business you have to be good with money so that&#39;s also added to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would this be a business you would start in Sayulita or in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;d probably start it here, in Sayulita.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s so cool. Well, I&#39;ll have to get the name</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">so I can come eat all the desserts. That</span><span>&nbsp;sounds </span><span class="c2 c0">amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My husband&#39;s like are you sure you want to put that? And yeah, that&#39;s what I want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m not questioning it. Sounds like you know. Do you think this entrepreneurial drive to have your own business, finish high school, pursue that better life for yourself and for your daughter, where do you think that comes from?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve noticed since I</span><span>&rsquo;ve</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;gotten here that we don&#39;t really have to go to the States to live a good life. We don&#39;t. We have everything we want here. There&#39;s a lot of US citizens. There&#39;s a lot of people from France. There&#39;s a lot of people from Canada, from everywhere, that come here. You have the opportunity here. You have the opportunity if you want, you can do so much no matter where you&#39;re at. So if you want something for yourself, if you want to be a better person, if you want to have something, if you really want it, you work for it. It doesn&#39;t matter where you are. In the </span><span>S</span><span class="c0">tates, I used to feel like I had it easy because you were able to get anything you wanted so quick because of the amount of money that you make over there is </span><span>way</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;different than here, and you make it so much faster over there than you do here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I basically had everything I wanted, and I come down here and I work a week in the fields, making $150 a day and anytime I wanted a pair of shoes, some tennis shoes and it was two weeks of work. So two weeks of work, but that means those two weeks of work I can&#39;t spend any of that money on buying food, on doing this, on doing that because I want this pair of shoes. How the hell am I going to do this? So knowing that now, that it&#39;s so much harder for you to get something here, and you have to work twice as much as you do over there, it&#39;s gotten to me that maybe if I were to live here first and suffer all of that, being in the States afterwards, I would&#39;ve probably been more responsible and probably done things a little differently than I did then because of the fact that I already know how it is to really struggle to get something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I can get it whenever I want, but I have to take care of it because I really struggled through. That&#39;s what I want her to be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I want her to see that. I want her to, when she actually is able to get something on her own, to feel proud of herself. Say I work my ass off to get this. Not just </span><span>handouts</span><span class="c0">. Not just</span><span>, &ldquo;G</span><span class="c0">ive me everything.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;She needs to actually work for it and that&#39;s what I want her to be. I think that&#39;s something very, very important. That&#39;s something everybody should have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time they told me</span><span>, &ldquo;W</span><span class="c0">hy do I put my daughter in Costa Bello,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;which you have to pay for her to be in there, and supposedly that&#39;s the best school here, because they teach you English, they teach you everything so it&#39;s most of the Americans, the Canadians, stuff like that, they go there. There&#39;s a lot of Mexican kids that go there, too. But I&#39;ve always said no. If a kid wants to learn, he&#39;s going to learn no matter what. No matter if you pay the best college, the best school ever, they&#39;re going to learn because they want to. And if they don&#39;t want to, not even investing all the money you have, they&#39;re not going to do it. It also depends on, I was telling you, the teachers and stuff like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to be honest, why </span><span>are you paying</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;so much money if your kid doesn&#39;t put everything he has into it? But my daughter is really smart. She&#39;s a really smart kid. She&#39;s really good with numbers, just like I was and sometime</span><span>s</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;I give her that opportunity. But I really want to see when she gets a little bit more older, like I told you she needs to be able to appreciate it. Show me that she is actually going to go for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re talking from your own experience</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c0">too. That makes a lot of sense, having that work ethic before giving all these opportunities as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m curious, does this specific case of Sayulita, just because of you having your own American habits, do you feel like you </span><span>relate to the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tourists, the diversity in Sayulita in a different way than maybe other Mexicans here do? Could be your dynamic or even just your English</span><span>?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I </span><span>do feel</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;more on the tourist side than I do on everybody else that lives here, that was born here in Mexico. I think I am a lot closer to all the tourists. I can relate a little bit more to them than to actual Mexicans down here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess tourists come in and out, but there&#39;s also people from other places that live here, right, do you have them as friends year</span><span>-</span><span class="c2 c0">round?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I do. I have more friends that are from the States and stuff like that than I do that were actually born here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel that you can relate to them</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c0">or?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah I can relate to them a lot more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do people ever seem surprised when some sorts of tourists come through, the connection they can have with you versus the people who grew up in Mexico</span><span class="c2 c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do get a lot of people that get really surprised but after a while</span><span>...</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I don&#39;t know why it is that I relate a little bit more to them than to... It&#39;s just, I think they&#39;re still close</span><span>-</span><span class="c0">minded and they live in their little box and it&#39;s oka</span><span>y,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it&#39;s good, but I want more and I want more and they&#39;re like</span><span>, &ldquo;O</span><span class="c0">kay I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m okay.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;They&#39;re more of a... I don&#39;t know how to say it. I&#39;m the type of person that... I&#39;m here right now but I want my own business. And then after having my own business, I want my house. And I want this and I </span><span>want to keep</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;going, keep going and they&#39;re like, </span><span>&ldquo;O</span><span class="c0">kay I have work I have a good place to live. I&#39;m good.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they&#39;re content.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no. We come from the States and there&#39;s a lot of people like me that think the same way thoug</span><span>h, </span><span class="c0">like</span><span>, &ldquo;N</span><span class="c0">o, I&#39;m not going to settle for this. I want my </span><span>car, I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;want my </span><span>house, I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;want this, I want this,</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and they keep going for it. I think that&#39;s why I relate a little bit more to people that come from United States, from out of Mexico, than people that live in Mexico that are from Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like that wanting more... For me that rings as the American Dream</span><span>,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;so to speak. But now you&#39;re making your own Mexican Dream here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like I told you. I want for people to know that you don&#39;t really have to put your life in danger to get what you really want. You don&#39;t. The other day there was a video about the kids and I just shared</span><span>&nbsp;it, </span><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t comment anything, and my cousin answered, </span><span>&ldquo;H</span><span class="c0">e put something like I think this is still the best nation. If it wasn&#39;t, why would your parents and my parents bring us up here to get our education and to live?</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I didn&#39;t answer, because at the same time I felt offended by it, but then I wanted to say </span><span>&ldquo;Y</span><span class="c0">ou don&#39;t have to go there to get... It&#39;s not the best nation. The best nation is where you make it the best nation. It&#39;s where you feel more better about yourself, where you can do better for yourself. You don&#39;t have to go somewhere else to be better. You can do it where you&#39;re at, no matter where you&#39;re at.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;It did get me mad, kind of that I just didn&#39;t answer. And there&#39;s a lot people that think like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of people who think that they have to go over there for them to get something better out of their life. It&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s not like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a really good point. What are some of the arguments you&#39;ve been hearing with this idea that maybe thought </span><span>processes,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;or how your ambitions, they&#39;ve been influenced by your time in the US, but I think it is interesting that people credit their ambition to the US</span><span>, b</span><span class="c0">ecause that comes from within. I think it comes from the drive of the student. In conflict with what you&#39;re saying, </span><span>a part of it is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;really Mexican as well. So it&#39;s really a mix of things. Sometimes the US gets a little more credit than </span><span>is</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;due.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#39;t get me wrong. It&#39;s great up there. I love it up there. Just to see the people that are up there, they get credited for the best nation because most of them are really united and they&#39;ve made a lot. They&#39;re high up there. They&#39;re good. What I see down here is most of the people are more on a jealous type of term. They see you&#39;re doing good and they pull you down to get on top of you but somebody else comes along and pulls them down so you can&#39;t really climb up there. Like </span><span>I&rsquo;ve always said,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Don&#39;t ever tell everybody that you&#39;re happy.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#39;t. Don&#39;t do it. Keep it to yourself. Be happy. You&#39;re going to show it, anyways. But if you keep telling</span><span>, &ldquo;O</span><span class="c0">h I&#39;m so happy, I have the best life</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and this and that</span><span>, s</span><span class="c0">omebody&#39;s going to come and take you down. So just keep going for it, without letting everybody else know. </span><span>If you&#39;re</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;going to go on a trip, go on it. Don&#39;t tell them</span><span>, &ldquo;O</span><span class="c0">h, next week I&#39;m going to go here,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;because there&#39;s a lot of people that are super jealous and envy you and don&#39;t want you to do better. And it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t want you to do good, it&#39;s that they don&#39;t want you to do better than them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not necessarily a negative thing. It&#39;s almost like sibling rivalry. You don&#39;t want bad things for someone, you just don&#39;t want better than what you have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s something that you have to live with here in Mexico. And in the States, I feel like, </span><span>&ldquo;O</span><span class="c0">h you&#39;re doing good, keep going!</span><span>&rdquo;A</span><span class="c2 c0">nd they keep pushing you and they keep pushing you to do better and here it&#39;s the opposite. You can&#39;t do better than me. And over there they help each other out. That&#39;s why they get a little bit more credit than we do though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s a really powerful point in general. So, do you see that as the heart of what&#39;s good or helpful in the US? </span><span>A</span><span class="c0">nd </span><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;experience there is a community that lifts</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c0">there is a positive push for everyone upwards in the pursuit of the American Dream or whatever you want to call it. Do you think given the current administration or even those heartbreaking clips of children in cages and the treatment especially of Mexican migrants. Do you think maybe something fundamental is changing or do you think the US will remain that country of communal striving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m hoping that it would change, but for the better. It would actually get them more together. Not only for people that are from the States but for all the migrants</span><span>, </span><span class="c5">los inmigrantes</span><span>, </span><span class="c2 c0">all the Mexicans, all the people from India, the people from all over the world. I hope that all those people will come together and make it even better instead of just going lower than they are right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do </span><span>you think this</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;moment of crisis in the US, an identity crisis, almost, could be an opportunity for those forces of diversity who are directly impacted by this crisis to make it actually better than it was before? Highlight the issue more so than ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s the way it will turn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now it&#39;s not looking good in the States but I&#39;m hoping that all that people will at least see it the way I do, to get more together and push it up instead of pulling lower than it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hope... What would you hope to change and what would you hope to get better in the US for</span><span>&nbsp;the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;US that your daughter</span><span>&nbsp;would</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;live in?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t see it as a bad thing to keep a lot of people out of there, to be honest, but not the way they&#39;re doing it. I know there&#39;s not a lot of good people but there is also good people. You get </span><span>50-50</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;anywhere you go. You go to the States, you&#39;re going to find people doing drugs and fights and guns and everything. You come here you see that, anywhere you go there&#39;s always going to be some kind of problem. We should do a lot of background checks and give the people that actually want the opportunity, that deserve the opportunity, the opportunity to actually do it. To show them that they&#39;re doing good, that they want to do better. And I&#39;m hoping that in the future, they would see it that way and give certain people from here from Mexico, from anywhere </span><span>ar</span><span class="c2 c0">ound the world the opportunity to prove that they&#39;re good. That they&#39;re good people. That they want to do better. That they want to help out. They want to do something different, not just be put down, and just because you&#39;re Mexican doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re a bad person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes there is a lot of bad people. Yes there is a lot of bad people in the States also.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not everybody&#39;s that way. And that&#39;s what a lot of Mexicans, a lot of people from anywhere are trying to prove wrong. That not all of us are gang members or drug dealers or anything like that. And hopefully in the future we prove them wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. This is what we&#39;re trying to do. Your stories may contribute to that. Your bakery will eventually also contribute to that. I&#39;m making </span><span>d</span><span class="c2 c0">anishes over here. Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s different. I was six months old when they took me over there. My family, we did good, I can&#39;t complain. But then came some really hard struggles when my mom and my dad got separated because my mom was illegal so my dad was usually the one doing all the renting and stuff so when my mom separated it was harder for us. Thankfully, we had family members that were there, my dad&#39;s side of the family, that helped out my mom a lot and they helped us out. But now I see it as through my daughter. If I had the opportunity to go right now</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I would go and be with her for her studies and everything. But I don&#39;t have the opportunity and it&#39;s really hard. So hopefully someday I will be able to go and take her and be with her there. Hopefully something will change. Hopefully everything that a lot of people are doing</span><span>, like m</span><span class="c2 c0">oving around a lot, I can see a lot. There&#39;s a lot of people from the States, a lot of Americans coming together with all the immigrants and to be honest that&#39;s nice. That&#39;s nice to see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there&#39;s people out there who are really, really there to help us out and that are trying to make a difference. And I wish that was everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a lot of people that we&#39;re seeing now, including myself, it&#39;s a reality check. Trump is a reality check. The fact that there is actually this negative voice and population in the US that does carry out hatred for others. I think that, I&#39;m hoping with you that this is a moment to come together and now be active, be in the streets. We have to be more active. Put our voices out there and use our privilege to help others who don&#39;t have that privilege. I hope that&#39;s the US that I will grow up in, and I hope that&#39;s the US that your daughter can participate in and you eventually as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I&#39;m doing it more for her. Like I told you, I don&#39;t really want to go back to the States. I would go visit if I had the opportunity to, but I have it all here and that&#39;s great. That&#39;s basically the same thing. Over there I used to go from home to work, from work, back home, and then do the same thing over and over again, paying rent, paying bills. That&#39;s basically what I do here, right now. I don&#39;t have my own business. I come to work, go home, cook, clean, do this, go back to that, pay rent, pay bills. It&#39;s basically the same thing. How do I explain it? Just because there are still dirt roads here and they see it less </span><span>than over there</span><span class="c2 c0">, it&#39;s the same exact thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do the same exact thing as over there, you do it here. Hopefully, they see all of that and my daughter can actually grow up here and see the difference that she has here, and the opportunity that she can go back and forth and be able to study over there. Be able to be somebody. She has that opportunit</span><span>y,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and, as much I can do, I&#39;m not going to let it go to waste. I want to keep pushing. It&#39;s a little tough for me but I&#39;m going to keep doing it. The other day I was talking to myself. We do it a lot. I was like, </span><span>&ldquo;Y</span><span class="c0">ou know what, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m going to do whatever it takes, for me to put her through college.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s 10 years old. She&#39;s still </span><span>a little</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;kid. But times goes fast. She&#39;s going to be in fifth grade next year. It&#39;s really hard. So, if she keeps going, if she wants to keep studying, I&#39;m going to keep putting her through school. If she goes to high school and she graduates, she wants to go to college, it doesn&#39;t matter if I have to work day and night, but I&#39;m going to put her through college. So if she wants that, I&#39;m going to do it for her. And here it&#39;s tough because if you send money from here to the States. You have to change pesos to dollars. So they&#39;ll charge you. What&#39;s the dollar in half? The exchange rate&#39;s 21, but when you buy them, the exchange rate is 25, so you&#39;re getting less money back and then you have to send that money. It&#39;s so complicated. So you&#39;re sending, I&#39;m going to say, 1000 pesos, is what, 500 dollars</span><span>?</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;No wait, something. A 1000 divided by 20. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s so much more. It&#39;s double, triple that you would actually be making here to put them through college. You have to work two jobs</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention on the weekends. And then what you have to do to have a living here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s going to be really tough, but if she wants it I&#39;m going to do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your husband feel the same way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells me</span><span>, &ldquo;S</span><span class="c0">he&#39;s not going to go to college</span><span>.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">I was like</span><span>, &ldquo;S</span><span class="c0">hut up, yes she is.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he say that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">She&#39;s going to drop out.</span><span>&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">It gets me so mad, that a lot of people are like, </span><span>&ldquo;Y</span><span class="c0">ou know what, your daughter isn&#39;t going to make it. She&#39;s going to be just like you. She&#39;s going to drop out.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And I was like</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;W</span><span class="c0">ait, wait, wait, wait, one thing is what I did and one thing is what she&#39;s going to do.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If I have the opportunity to put her through it, then I&#39;m going to do it, because she can do it. Because she is a citizen and she has the opportunity to. I couldn&#39;t do it</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;but I&#39;m not going to let her go to waste because I can&#39;t do it. So I&#39;m going to be those types of Mexicans that&#39;s going to change.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Instead of pulling her down I&#39;m going to push her up. She&#39;s my daughter. Why can&#39;t she do it? And my husband just laughs like </span><span>&ldquo;Y</span><span class="c0">ou know, I&#39;ll help you out, whatever you want.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;But it kind of gets on my nerves sometimes. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">She&#39;s going to drop out. You&#39;re not even going to have to pay for the college.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And I was like</span><span>, &ldquo;d</span><span class="c0">on&#39;t say it, don&#39;t say it.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;He never tells her. He never tells her. He supposedly jokes around with me but sometimes I take it seriously. Don&#39;t say it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is serious. It&#39;s the future you couldn&#39;t have. It&#39;s the future you want for your daughter. For me, it </span><span>doesn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;sound like a great joke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it gets on my nerves. I&#39;m not really close to my mom&#39;s side of the family and they&#39;re always putting us down, me and my daughter. I&#39;m like </span><span>&ldquo;U</span><span class="c0">h-uh, nope, I&#39;m going to prove them wrong.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Did you know that I started working in the fields because my aunt told me I couldn&#39;t do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s like </span><span>&ldquo;N</span><span class="c0">ope. You&#39;re more of those fingernail</span><span>-</span><span class="c0">painted and you get your pedicures and you&#39;re always in high heels and you&#39;re a goody good girl. You&#39;re not going to be able to last a minute in the field.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;So I worked in the fields </span><span>for</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;two years to prove her wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like you might&#39;ve gotten the worse end of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was actually pretty fun. It&#39;s pretty fun. It&#39;s hard work. </span><span>It&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;really hard work, but it&#39;s fun. I also worked selling tamales in my mom&#39;s hometown in the street. We had a tricycle and we put a cooler, and we&#39;d throw the tamales in there and we also had those </span><span class="c5 c0">raspados</span><span class="c0">. (shaved ice) Do you know what a </span><span class="c0 c5">raspado</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;is?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Describe it to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like an </span><span>Icee</span><span class="c0">. So you have to scrape the ice. We had a big block of ice on top of the tricycle. We put wood right there and we&#39;re scraping in and throwing in strawberries and making ceviche. I would go street by street, house by house, selling that. Screaming all down the street that there was </span><span class="c5 c0">tamales</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5 c0">raspados</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and everything. And it&#39;s hard work here. It&#39;s really hard work. But I&#39;m now I&#39;m like, </span><span>&ldquo;F</span><span class="c0">uck, I threw everything away up there.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US or?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. In the US because it was so easy. And I&#39;m struggling here. Okay I have my car now. I bought my car here. We struggled a lot. It probably was a year of work to get that car</span><span>, b</span><span class="c2 c0">etween me and my husband. We both got it together and we both paid it off together. It&#39;s tough. It&#39;s tough. Like I told you, it&#39;s to prove people wrong. To prove to them that no matter if you&#39;re in Mexico, you could do something with your life. I think that&#39;s something that everybody needs to see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get the opportunity wherever you go. It&#39;s just if you want to take it or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. Really, unless there&#39;s something else you want to share that you want people to know. I think your story, your message, has been extremely powerful on every account.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want people to know that, never stop trying no matter where you&#39;re at. And don&#39;t feel less than anybody because everybody has the opportunity unless, it just depends on whether you want to take it or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. Your daughter&#39;s very lucky to have a </span><span>mother with that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>grit</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll pass on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Zoraya:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c1 c7"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><div><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c13"><tbody><tr class="c8"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p></td><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c0">Page </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
