For sure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question is why did you decide to leave Mexico and how did you get to the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I decide?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I wanted to learn English, I guess, the American dream. I wanted to make money, live well. I did to the river. I crossed the river. That&#39;s how I did it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were 17?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 17 then.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you did it alone?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah, I mean with some people there at the border, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it to leave your family behind in Mexico? How did that feel?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">&nbsp;Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hard. It was difficult at first you know. I was a teenager still. It was hard. I was at the border for a month trying to cross, and </span><span class="c0">then</span><span class="c0 c6">&nbsp;when I get </span><span class="c0">to </span><span class="c0 c6">cross, I was there another month o</span><span class="c0">r</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;so, waiting to travel to Houston, actually. It took me three months to get to Houston.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me about it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It </span><span class="c0">was, yeah </span><span class="c0 c6">I remember when I crossed the border. It was so pretty. I find it was like a different world. It was very, very nice, clean. It was dark because it was, I think, it was </span><span class="c0">like</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;10:00 or 9:00. I don&#39;t know. Yeah, it was very different. It was nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you do your first day?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a hamburger and then I just... We just went to hike.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was the hamburger?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was awesome. It was very good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did you get it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. It was near the border, because we walked like all night, and then hot in the day, and then we start walking again in the afternoon. Then, I don&#39;t know, we walk a lot. So, </span><span class="c0">i</span><span class="c1 c0">t was my first meal. It was awesome.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. How did you end up learning English? What did you do when you got to the states?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was awful at first. I used mainly </span><span class="c0">through</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;TV, though, with subtitles and everything, watching movies and then making friends, people at work. That&#39;s how, I guess, that&#39;s how I learned English, though. Yeah, mostly with friends, and you know girlfriends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you go to school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to, but I just didn</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;t</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;had to support. I had to pay for my bills and everything. It was either work or study.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did you work?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I work in a lot of places, really, many, many things. My first job, I think, was cleaning, I think, for some Chinese guy. I don&#39;t know. Yeah, it was cleaning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember any specific friends, </span><span class="c0">or</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;people, somebody in the US that made an impact?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did have friends from there though. I keep in touch with them. Yeah, I do remember a lot of friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mexican friends or American friends?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whichever, just people who you remember.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c1 c0">ause I hang out most with white people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my ex-wife was white. It was good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever come across any gangs or any of that sort of thing?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No? Your ex-wife, you had mentioned that you have...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... a son?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, what happened?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, no, I mean tell me about him. Tell me about your family and that stuff in the states.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s hard. I haven&#39;t seen him ever since I was, since they took me. When the police got me was back in </span><span class="c0">what</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;2010, I guess. It was 2010 when they got me, and then they put me away. I haven&#39;t seen my son ever since.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old was your son then?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was five at that time. I was already divorced with his mom. She never took him to see me or anything. I used to call him, though, every other week, every week sometimes. She got married again with another Mexican </span><span class="c0">[inaudible 00:06:11]</span><span class="c0 c6">. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">S</span><span class="c1 c0">he deleted her Facebook. She moved, changed her cell phone. I haven&#39;t talked to my son. It&#39;s been a while, though. I don&#39;t know anything about him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During your time in the states you pretty much just worked? What else did you do for fun? Or what did you like to do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go out a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean I used to go to the games, a lot of football. Played ball with my friends. What else? Just drink, party, work, hunting sometimes, fishing. That&#39;s pretty much all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me how you ended up back in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? I was deported.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How were you deported?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because when I was released from prison, they even offer me to... They gave me for my ticket, though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait. Why were you in prison?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took me because I was illegal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they get you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICE got me when I was in [inaudible 00:07:41]. I pay my bond. It was $1,000. I paid that, and then they said my status was illegal, so they took me. They sent me to prison. When I got out of prison, I was supposed to be released, but I didn&#39;t, though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were just minding your own business one day and then ICE just got you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I was drinking and driving. There was a stop. They were doing some type of a... I don&#39;t know. They were looking for someone. I didn&#39;t have a license. I passed the test, but they knew, so they checked my status and they sent me to jail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You passed the breather test and stuff?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. But they still took me, so in jail all night and then the next day, when I paid my bond, that&#39;s when they were ready, so they took me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that return like? How has that been?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was awful at first, no money and my wallet and my stuff, everything was missing. That&#39;s what the marshal say, it was missing. I have no money at all, no clothes, zero contacts. I don&#39;t have any phone number. I didn&#39;t even know how I was going to make it here until I crossed the border and I met these people. They told me that they could help me with... How much was it? I think it was</span><span class="c0">&hellip;</span><span class="c0 c6">&nbsp;like I think they say 2,000 pesos. That was the limit for my ticket. I think it was 1655 pesos. I don&#39;t know how much was it. They paid for it, though. They even got me an ID because I didn&#39;t have anything at all. </span><span class="c0">And t</span><span class="c1 c0">hat&#39;s how I got here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who got you the ID and everything, w</span><span class="c0">as it</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;people in Mexico or were they people in the states?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you do when you come back? Did you see your family? How was that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah. The first day, as soon as I got here, I start to... Well, I didn&#39;t... It was changed, the city. I needed, for the metro, I needed to buy a ticket, so someone at the bus station, I think at the time it was two pesos, I think. I don&#39;t know how much was it. They give me five pesos, and that&#39;s how I bought my ticket. Then I knew my way for some reason. It&#39;s not that hard to be here on the metro. I just went to see my aunt and then my mom. It was nice. It was kind of sad, but it was nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way was it sad?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I never expect to be back in Mexico the way I did, broke and no clothes and everything. I don&#39;t know. My dream just went away. I don&#39;t know. It was bad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the hardest part of coming back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t, I didn&rsquo;t,</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;I never thought I was going to be back at all. I had my life there. I don&#39;t know. It was hard, though, because I have no friends, no money, no clothes, no job. I didn&#39;t know what to do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You virtually come back to a country that you don&#39;t know. Right? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was changed a lot, a lot, buildings a lot, malls and whatnot. It was very different. The people, the way they look at me because of my tattoos. It was bad. It was bad. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your survey you mentioned that one of the challenges that you faced was discrimination. Can you talk a little bit about that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was starting to get a job, because of my tattoos they thought I was like, I don&#39;t know, a member of a gang. I don&#39;t know what they thought. I don&#39;t even smoke, but they would say I was... I don&#39;t know. It was bad, though. Then my first job that I was able to land, I was making 700 pesos a week, I think. That&#39;s not enough, though. After I met this girl, and she told me that she was working as a bilingual and she was making good money. That&#39;s how it started. Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t even know about it, like a bilingual job here. That&#39;s how I started working at the call center ever since. That was in 2012. I think it was May. I got here September, so yeah, it was in May, I think, when I was able I got that job. It was pretty decent. Ever since, I just start working in the call center.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you like about call centers?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money, I guess, talk to people, meeting new people. What else? Somehow I feel like I&#39;m still connected to people in the States, so that&#39;s what I like also.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you received any help from the government or any other organization at all?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here? No, I wish not at all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned that you are going to start continuing your studies. What has prevented you from doing so, so far?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have another son here now, so I have to pay child support because I&#39;m not with the mom. That and I have to pay my bills, my rent. I have to have a stable job so I can go to school, but it&#39;s hard because you have to work nine, eight, nine, ten hours so you can make a decent money. It&#39;s hard, though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you miss about the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I miss about the states? Well, mainly my son, my friends, the culture, I guess, the way that you can live there. It&#39;s different. That&#39;s pretty much all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you think that the United States shaped who you are today?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t hear that question. What was that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you think that the United States shaped who you are today?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I me</span><span class="c0">an </span><span class="c0 c6">I guess I learned English because of there, so I </span><span class="c0">gotta be</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;thankful, all the ways I see things different because the culture is a lot different. The people I used to hang out with, it was decent a people. I don&#39;t know. I guess just a different way of seeing the life of what you do, what you can achieve. I don&#39;t know. I guess it was in a good way, though. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now I guess, I guess now Mexican again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexican again?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. When I came back, I didn&#39;t feel Mexican at all, though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I feel like I&#39;m rejected by my own people, so I didn&#39;t... I felt like I didn&#39;t belong here, even though I was born here. It was, I don&#39;t know, it felt weird. Yeah, it was weird.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you could have stayed in the United States, what do you think you would have done?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the American dream, probably have a career, I don&#39;t know, be with my son, start a new family maybe. I don&#39;t know, just be there, though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said that you got deported for life?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For life, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because they caught you one day and you hadn&#39;t done anything wrong, basically. And of course drinking and driving is not okay, but you passed the test.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did pass the test with the pen and everything, but I guess officer, he was racist. He was white, but you can tell. He was very, very racist. I guess, I don&#39;t know, based on my record I guess they decided I was not a welcome person there, I guess. Like I say, I was married also. I applied for my citizenship. I was about to become a resident, not citizen, resident, but I got divorced, so...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were married to </span><span class="c0">a</span><span class="c0 c6">&nbsp;citizen? To an American citiz</span><span class="c0">en</span><span class="c1 c0">?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, yeah. I had a court day in Georgia, but I missed that because I was in prison. The letter said it was okay, though, that I don&#39;t need to worry about it, but obviously it wasn&#39;t because they deported me anyway. So one day, when I was released from Mississippi, they picked me up again, ICE. They take me. They took me to where it was this... Where they took me, though? I think it was a Thursday, or Wednesday or Thursday. It was 9:00 or 8:00, because I hadn&#39;t even had breakfast that day. They took me to some kind of like a </span><span class="c0">rathole</span><span class="c0 c1">. It was bad, though. I was there for three nights, and then on Monday they took me to the... I don&#39;t know if a prison, but it was for only people from everywhere. Where was that at? All I remember was they had good food there, though. It was good food. It was good. The only thing good about it was the food.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What </span><span class="c0">was bad? </span><span class="c1 c0">How did they treat you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was good. They didn&#39;t let me. I wanted to see a judge but they didn&#39;t let me. They just went to my cell one night and they said I was going to be deported.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn&#39;t they let you see a judge?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. They were laughing, though. They didn&rsquo;t need to. I said, &quot;I didn&#39;t sign anything.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, &quot;Well, you know what? You don&#39;t need to sign anything. You&#39;re going to go back to your country.&quot; They just took me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you&#39;re back in Mexico, what do you think you&#39;d like to do? What are your hopes and dreams?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here? I guess buy a house, have a steady job so I can do well. I guess make my American dream here now. Now that I&#39;m here, no</span><span class="c0">w </span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;that I realize that you can also make money here. It&#39;s going to be hard, but it&#39;s not impossible. You can make it happen, though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s no other questions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s all?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I have. But I guess now I want to give you the chance to just say anything you&#39;d like to add, anything that you feel like you didn&#39;t say or that you&#39;d want me to know. Now&#39;s the time. Whatever you want to say.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c6">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever I want to say? I wish I can go back at least once to see my son, though. If they could just allow me to once see, that would be nice. I mean I know it&#39;s tough. That&#39;s not an option, but that would be now my only reason to go back to the states, probably see my friends, but mainly my son. Definitely not to stay, though, because I don&#39;t think I can... Well, who knows? It&#39;s not anywhere in my plans to live in the States or go back to the States, though. After the way I was treated when they deport me, no. I feel like I was somehow betrayed. Because those people from ICE,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;they were,</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;it was bad. It was bad, so...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you good with everything you&#39;ve told me?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, well thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1 c0">Javier:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re welcome.</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><div><p class="c10 c12"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c9"><tbody><tr class="c18"><td class="c16" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c7"></span></p></div></body></html>
