I&#39;ve been here maybe about a year if you add them together. I first got deported on April the 5th, 2017. I got arrested, I think on February 23rd and did a month in&hellip; Well, I did the weekend in federal because the immigration where they hold you at wasn&#39;t open on the weekend. So I had to wait the weekend in a federal penitentiary. They kept me in the medical room since I didn&#39;t commit a felony or anything like that, they didn&#39;t want me to risk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after that weekend they take me to immigration, do a month immigration. I ended up getting a voluntary departure. It was in the library there, for the first two weeks, trying to figure out if there&#39;s a way for me to come back or anything like that. But I understand why they wouldn&#39;t have internet in there. With that done said limited to the information I was able to provide and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also making phone calls and all that, which I understand. I do see big pictures and stuff and I take myself out of the equation to look at it better in different views. I was limited to the information I was able to obtain, but from what was there, I was able to accumulate that basically nothing was going to help me out. So once I went to the judge, I just asked if I can have voluntary departure. That way I can better my chances of coming back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Been arrested over there before, three possessions of marijuana, but it&#39;s personal use; a blunt. A sack which you buy for $10. And so it wasn&#39;t in anything, pounds or anything like that. When I went to jail it would be for like a week or so. So nothing major. I didn&#39;t have any license or anything like that. And honestly, it&#39;s the mentality. I guess I&#39;ll get to that in a little bit, but I didn&#39;t have insurance and I do feel really bad on that one because just one time a cop put it to me. A good cop. I mean, he was angry because... and I understood and why, basically the insurance is very important. The license is understood. You can&#39;t get it. But the insurance is very important because if you do get in a crash, the other person is basically screwed and if it was your fault, because since you don&#39;t have insurance, then who&#39;s going to pay for that. So I understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah, a cool, cool cop. He basically </span><span class="c2 c8">me rega&ntilde;o</span><span class="c2 c3">, but yeah, I&#39;ve been for minor stuff. I have turned in myself. Normally you pay $50 for each ticket to a lawyer there instead of going to the court itself. But I guess I forgot one or two and I was going to get a good job, required a lot of responsibility, me driving around. So I done even gone to jail and turned myself. Knew that I had one on </span><span class="c2">_____</span><span class="c2 c3">. So I go there and then after that I tell them there, I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey, I think I have one for </span><span class="c2">_____ </span><span class="c2 c3">County. I think I might have one for this.&quot; I just started naming places just in case. I can just make sure that everything is taken care of. But they tell me, &quot;No, we only take care of </span><span class="c2">_____</span><span class="c0">. Once you get out of here, you take care of the other ones.&quot; Which I did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t go straight out when I got out. I only did three days in </span><span class="c2">_____</span><span class="c2 c3">but ohhhh, man. You&rsquo;re literally just in a little cell and it was boring. I was asking the lady there, I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey, can I clean? Can I help you clean or something just to get out the little cage.&quot; So I get out, I waited about a week and then go ahead and go to </span><span class="c2">____</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;County, turned myself in there as well. So I done even turn myself in any times that I&#39;ve been in jail. They asked me where you&#39;re from. I&#39;m from Mexico. What&#39;s your social security? I don&#39;t have one. Everything&#39;s been good. There was a one time that I actually thought I was going to start that route because they were getting a lot of people, we were about to get released and they&#39;re getting everybody that was immigrant. And I was like, okay, they&#39;re probably going to take me. But I was young. I didn&#39;t really think the stuff through really. I&#39;m like, okay, it don&#39;t matter. But I was chill about it. I can&#39;t do nothing about it if that&#39;s the consequence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do understand in my mind that I am not from that country. Even though I considered it home, and I do understand that home is where you make it. So it wasn&#39;t like it was one spot that was my home. But </span><span class="c2">Texas</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was just home. And I know that Mexico will be soon my home as well. I&#39;d like to think in positives because only negative comes out thinking negative. So I turned myself, I thought I was getting scared that I might, well, not scared, but I thought that the possibility was that I would get deported or anything, but no, never. I guess for the amount of years that I was there, they consider that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was in </span><span class="c2">San Antonio </span><span class="c2 c3">drinking a beer on the </span><span class="c2">Riverwalk </span><span class="c2 c3">which is fine. I finished it, I go up, get a beer. And then I opened it before getting to the </span><span class="c2">Riverwalk.</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;So the cop gets me like, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s that?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;It&#39;s a beer. You want one?&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;You can&#39;t drink here.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I know. I was just going down to the </span><span class="c2">Riverwalk </span><span class="c0">but I just opened it before.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, I have to take you in for this.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;No, that&#39;s fine. I understand.&quot; And so we just started chatting and he&#39;s like, &quot;Man, I wish that it wasn&#39;t the end of the month because we have to make our numbers because man, you&#39;re real chill about it. You understand stuff. So I woulda just gave you a warning or something like that or make you dump the beer or something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cops have been like that, my life, I only had two cops that were just like really... Just two bad cops, I guess you can say that. But every other cop man is, I mean, they&#39;re doing their job. Not most of the time. Most of the time they&#39;re just sitting in the car and stuff, but there&#39;d be times where they really are putting their lives in risk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ended up going in and right before getting released that&#39;s when immigration gets in there, because for PI, it was public intoxication. Wasn&#39;t where you&#39;re disturbing the peace or anything like that. I was simply just enjoying the view, drink me a beer, finish it. I wanted to continue and enjoy the view, just sit there and enjoy the scenery. There&#39;s a lot of people there, there&#39;s family and all that. So I was just enjoying the moment. And so I go get me another beer. And when I come down, I open it and they get me, take me to jail. It&#39;s 15 hours that you do. I mean, you get out in 15 hours, but right before getting out, that&#39;s when immigration came in. &quot;Where are you from?&quot; &quot;Mexico.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s your social?&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t have one.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; &quot;Miguel.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long story short, he comes back in a couple of minutes and like, &quot;Follow me.&quot; I was like, dang, that&#39;s it? And I&#39;m like, all right. So when the process started. I go to... And it&#39;s not like where take you all the way to where you&#39;re born or something like that. They just literally dropped you off at the border, and in my case it was Laredo, Texas. And they make you walk to </span><span class="c2">Nuevo Laredo</span><span class="c2 c3">. So don&#39;t know nobody. I only had one uncle that I knew and I probably thought that maybe we weren&#39;t going to click or something like that. Good people, good people, but for whatever reason, I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m just going to make it here. This is where I&#39;m at. I don&#39;t know anywhere else that I can go. So this is where I&#39;m at.&quot; </span><span class="c2">Nuevo Laredo</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seen like, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s depending on you, of course, that luck. There&#39;s always that luck, that something&#39;s going to happen and if it&#39;s going to happen, it&#39;s going to happen. You can&#39;t prevent that. That&#39;s the life, this is unpredictable life. But on many occasions, as long as you&#39;re taking care of things, you&#39;re not being... The best way I can describe it, you&#39;re not bringing attention or negative attention or some kind of attention, either, to be very bluntly, especially in my shoes there because I mean, if you have a house or something like that, that&#39;s fine, you have your transportation. It&#39;s easier to get from point A to point B. But since I didn&#39;t know the area, I didn&#39;t even know anything, I didn&#39;t know nobody. You have to go to a state of mind where you&#39;re like, okay, I&#39;m an easy target, but I don&#39;t know, I don&rsquo;t know. I guess I&#39;m just blabbering right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did an immigration house for a month, then left, went and rent a place, left out of there, there was a lot of situations where it was like, dang. So I ended up leaving there and then basically lived in the street for a couple months. And there, it was a different state of mind, especially. It&#39;s different variables. I mean, if you go to a different city in your same state or same country, or same state. Same state, same country, different place. It&#39;s different from immigration because you&#39;re easily targeted. Well, just from my experience, my situation, it&#39;s a different thing. Especially if you being an immigrant and then having a couple of organizations, we&#39;ll call them. Not the organizations that help you out, the other organization</span><span class="c2">s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes back to the same thing, don&#39;t draw attention. But at the same time, it&#39;s easier. You&#39;re a target in a way. because you are. I mean, I have to explain that one. As long as you don&#39;t call attention and all that. But yeah, I was just living in the streets there. They drink that 16 pesos&mdash;it&#39;s like a dollar-something bottle of alcohol. And they drank regular, so I started drinking regular as well. And of course, if I were to talk once upon a time with my family or something like that, I&#39;ll be, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m good. I&#39;m good. I&#39;m good.&quot; And I wouldn&#39;t call them a lot because I didn&#39;t want them to get used to it. Same time I didn&#39;t have cell phone or anything like that. It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t want to trust people or anything like that. It&#39;s more of being cautious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I talked to my family or something, I would tell them I&#39;m fine. But honestly I was like emotionally inside, it was it. I mean, your whole life since the age of two years old over there, and then turn yourself in. Gone to jail for the possession of marijuana or a ticket that I forgot to call my lawyer to pay. But other than that, it wasn&#39;t anything else. But anyways, going to jail and all that and like nothing, you understand that I wasn&#39;t a citizen. There was a couple times that there were some options, but for certain reasons that option was no longer there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last option, which is basically money. And also, of course there&#39;s always that option to get married. I mean, that&#39;s the quickest way I believe, if I speak honestly. I guess I&#39;m romantic, man. I prefer to just get married one time. I do live in the real world. I don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s something else. I won&#39;t be able to do it just that quick just for that type of motive. The other option was just money. Having a good source of money because you can get your papers for money. But basically I was just emotionally just broken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So yeah, I started drinking as well since it&#39;s around me. From the age of 17 to 27, I have only got to three fights, and they were self-defense. One guy even came inside the house. It was just self-defense. But there the total five months living in Nuevo Laredo&hellip; After the last three months, I ended up getting into three fights and those fights, one particular got the attention of organizations because it was with one of them and I ended up getting respect. So I stay away, but at the same time where I was at, living at, it was close to certain things. So I would try to keep it cool, but started drinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll stay away from that because I wanted to make it right here and I was making it right over there as well, but I don&#39;t know I was just staying away from that. I understand that they can bring in a lot of negativity. Yes, it is that quick money and stuff, but I don&#39;t mind sweating for my money. I prefer to do that. I feel better about it. Drinking, and then little by little started more and more hanging around with certain people from certain organizations. The thoughts and all this are getting bigger. I mean, I still don&#39;t think I would do it. I know I wouldn&#39;t do it, but it was just like, nah, I don&#39;t know, I just hit that moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, long story short, I go back. I did </span><span class="c2">s</span><span class="c0">omething, I won&#39;t discuss this, now after those five months, go back and that&#39;s with immigration and there I did a month in jail and then six months in immigration, and come out. And as soon as I came out, that&#39;s when I went to that uncle. From there I just networked, met some other uncles, met some other... Went to another place. And with this time I actually, I knew that I need to count on the support of my family. It&#39;s just that it was, I guess, it was hard because there was a lot of variables as well, but I think that this is one as well, that would hit me strong. That would get me into that roller coaster, that circle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over there, the last year that I was over there, I wasn&#39;t really sending a lot of money to my mom&#39;s or stuff like that. But I was used to sending money to my mom&#39;s or helping her out or something like that, or the family, or my sister. She </span><span class="c2">had did a</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;15</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(</span><span class="c2 c8">Birthday party</span><span class="c2">)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;maybe a year before I got deported, for my niece. I helped out with that too. So I&#39;m used to making my own money and then helping out the family. So whenever I need help, I guess it was a lot of variable things. It was just a lot of things that connected. But I would say that that was one, when they would send me money, I&#39;m like, &quot;Ah, man.&quot; My mom&#39;s not even working. She&#39;s sending over here, she&rsquo;s struggling, she&#39;s sending over here. And then that would make me feel sad as well and all that. So I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah, once I get to my uncle, I connect to other places. And then from there, because I came at a time that it was credentials, so I couldn&#39;t get an ID. So my plan was to hopefully use the English language and the fluency that I have on it, that I can work mostly in a call center or some kind of industry that starts with that, to start off with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adrian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember when you immigrate to US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I&#39;ve been here since the age of two and all the way to 27. So over there I had my first feelings, I had my first friends, my first girlfriend, first slap from my girlfriend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adrian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you went to middle school, high school over here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I </span><span class="c2">started</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;school, everything like that. They ask me how did I learn English. I&#39;m like, I don&#39;t know. How would someone over there learn English? It was there. My pops actually got murdered over there when I was like maybe five or six. So my mom, she worked a lot. So I didn&#39;t really have a lot of communication with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was funny, because the one time my sister was in my mom&#39;s house, where she lived there, I didn&#39;t live there, and I just come in there and just say hello to them, and I just go to the refrigerator, open it real quick, and just leave. And I come back and I bring some food and stuff like that, put it in my mom&#39;s refrigerator. And then my sister asked me like, &quot;Hey, you don&#39;t love mom?&quot; Ooh, I wanted to slap her. But in my head, of course I wasn&#39;t going to do it, but I asked her like, &quot;Why are you asking me that?&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;I see that you just come in and you just say hi, and then you just ask mom if she needs something and you just leave.&quot; And I&#39;m like, well, it was different. It&#39;s different from how my mom is right now than when my mom was with us, because with me generally, because she worked all the time, so I really didn&#39;t speak with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just </span><span class="c2 c8">hola ma, adios ma, como esta ma, ya me voy ma</span><span class="c2 c3">, and that was basically it. And then in school, especially when you&#39;re little, that&#39;s when you listen to the teachers. And it was worse because they didn&#39;t scream at you. It was more of like, they made you feel guilty. And you&#39;re little, you&#39;re listening. So they&#39;re like, &quot;Miguelito, how would you like for these two guys to talk in different language that you don&#39;t understand and they laugh, and they&#39;re looking at your way. Would you think that they&#39;re talking about you?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;How would that make you feel?&quot; &quot;Very sad, </span><span class="c2 c3 c8">maestra</span><span class="c0">, I mean, teacher.&quot; And then she&#39;s like, &quot;Well, how do you think they feel when y&#39;all two talks a different language that he doesn&#39;t know, and y&rsquo;all say a joke?&quot; And so they make you feel guilty. You eat that, and you&#39;re little so you&#39;re like, &quot;I&#39;ll never do it again.&quot; So you start just talking English.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom was, she was working, she was paying bills, making sure we have shoes and stuff like that; the stuff that we needed. </span><span class="c2">But yea man, I love my mom</span><span class="c0">. But yeah, she&#39;s paying bills and all that. So I wouldn&#39;t talk to her that much and the teacher, and then friends, everybody&#39;s speaking English. I didn&#39;t really speak the language. So when I got here, I was even more of a target, especially in Nuevo Laredo. I&#39;ve gotten better. Especially, I like to read. I got in immigration house, they had a couple of selections of books and I&#39;ll try to get the baby books in Spanish. So that way I could start reading basic Spanish and I started getting used to it, and they had some dinosaur ones and I tried to read that. If I got something else, a regular book, I wouldn&#39;t understand it, and I wanted to enjoy what I was trying to do, what I needed to do, learn Spanish, because even though I can find me a job in English, but I still have to understand Spanish either way, the rest of the regular life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister tells me that, and the Spanish thing and seeing... Going back to when I came at the time of the elections and after that, soon as I can get credentials, I went ahead and came to the city to try to get a job. Honestly, if you were to ask me, maybe when I first got here, I probably would have told you, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m good. I&#39;m good.&quot; But I was honestly just broken inside. It&#39;s just changing. It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s not like where you&#39;re in a different city, different place, it&#39;s just right now, I don&#39;t have the options to go visit my family, and some of the family doesn&#39;t have the options to come over here. So it has that in my head, but I&#39;m a very positive person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll be straight blunt, and it&#39;s probably just me, that I just like looking at things positive way or whatever it is. But we are where we&#39;re at. Over there, I was making good money, but I was spending it as well. There was times where I was saving and occasions that I was happy that I saved it because things came up and I was able to have that cushion, I had that pillow. But it wasn&#39;t all the time that I was saving. I&#39;m making, and I know that I was going to get paid again. So I&#39;ll go to Dave and Buster&#39;s or places where I can drink me a beer, eat some wings or something like that, watch a game and stuff. It wasn&#39;t like, I know there was a lot of people who go into cantinas or strip clubs or something like that. It was just more like, I liked to join, I like going places, so not just stay in one location and look at each other and that&#39;s it, run out of things to talk, you know. I like being social person. I forgot what I was talking about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adrian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the wings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adrian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but if you want to tell a little bit about your return to Mexico. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, that&#39;s where I was going to get.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at things in a positive way. So over there, where I was trying to get to is just that I went... Over there I used to spend it. And in here... The first thing that you do when you come here is you turn anything into dollars. So you&#39;re looking at something and you&#39;re looking at the price, you&#39;re like, &quot;What? This is 10 pesos. That&#39;s like 50 cents.&quot; So yeah, I can spend 50 cents. And if somebody asks me for money, yeah, I&#39;ll give you five pesos or 10 pesos, or 20 pesos. That&#39;s fine. That&#39;s only a dollar. I just gave you a dollar and it would work for you. But then you realize, okay, I ran out of money. I know I had some pesos, like 500 pesos and stuff and that&#39;s 500. But when you&#39;re converting them to dollars, you&#39;re thinking, oh, it&#39;s only this. Long story short, you end up just basically spending that money fast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s the thing that I haven&#39;t gotten used to yet. Now I think in pesos, but&hellip; That&#39;s the tough part, but I&#39;m not at all, and that&#39;s what I wanted to get to. And I know back then, if you would have asked me, I would have said, okay, I&#39;m good. I&#39;m good. But I was emotionally destroyed. But now, I still have my moments where like... Christmas, like shoot, Christmas, man? I was drinking a beer crying, man. Remembering my mom&#39;s, remembering the family and stuff and friends and stuff. So some tears fell off. But on a regular basis, I mean, we got to live every moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I&#39;m kind of glad over here because now, one, I&#39;m free. So you ain&#39;t going to get no sad story from me as far as like, no, you know what? I&#39;m here. I&#39;m going to make out of it the best I can. And then, and that&#39;s it. We can only move forward, and we got to face reality how it is. I have my opinions. I do see the big picture as well. So I do think about both sides, like the one I&#39;m at right now, the one over there. But at the end of the day we can only move forward. We can&#39;t do nothing about moving back, the regurgitating. We can learn from our past.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially right now, I got to learn how to make sure I save my money. Especially here. It takes you longer to make it. And the state I&#39;m in because I don&#39;t plan to stay in this state, as in right now, I&#39;m still in that taking care of the basics. Making sure I have a tea, drink me a beer too. So I&#39;m not all the way down where I&#39;m thinking about, do I have something to eat? Or something like that. I do have a house. Well, where I&#39;m renting. I have the basics. I&#39;m able to even buy me some clothes, some stuff and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&#39;m not where I first started, but I don&#39;t plan to stay here as well. I want to make sure I get some properties or something because there&#39;s money here in Mexico. And the fact that I can actually go anywhere else in the world, I mean, I&#39;m free. I&#39;m free here. I&#39;m not worrying about the immigration. I&#39;m not worrying about anything. I&#39;m able to get some jobs that give you benefits, over there I couldn&#39;t. And I was very limited to what I was able to do because you use social security. And then it gets to your head as well. I mean, you might not thinking like, okay, I&#39;m less or something like that, but it&#39;s there. I mean, your mind thinks so much that you sometimes don&#39;t understand what&#39;s thinking about. But you sometimes feel, well I felt, I can only talk about myself. So let me rephrase that and say, I felt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, I felt okay, I&#39;m limited, and that&#39;s the more direct word I can use, I can come up with. I felt limited. Here, I mean, right now I might be limited because of the resources that I have, the connections that I have. I&#39;m barely starting off, but I&#39;m only going to look positive</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(Second Recording) Miguel Angel 2 1 6 19</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adrian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you think you come back to U.S.? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. See, I&#39;m 30 years old right now, and they gave me 10 years that I can&#39;t return, and so basically, the way I see it, I&#39;m not going anywhere that I am not legally entering. The options for you are very limited, and then there is so many other variables that would just... like right now. I would like to go to Canada and work, but since I have that with the... Since I&#39;m in the federal database now, Canada would see that, and then see that, and then I won&#39;t be able to enter now. So the option there is... and that&#39;s Canada was one of the places I wanted to go to. It&#39;s just dope. I&#39;d like to go visit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. You just hear Canada, and I wanted to... Like, it has popped in my head, like, &quot;Go to Canada,&quot; and especially entering here, I&#39;m like... Well, at first I was like, I need to go where they have my language. I needed to go somewhere I can express myself because I&#39;m very limited here in the language to start off with. I mean, I&#39;m getting better, but like just starting jokes. I want to add, but I don&#39;t know how to say it in Spanish so it ends up I have to explain the joke, and it&#39;s like it&#39;s not funny after the explaining, and then sometimes it&#39;s not even the same meaning to words and the phrases.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s, you don&#39;t much get a laugh, so it&#39;s like, &quot;What&#39;s the point?&quot; Here, I don&#39;t know. One of the things I was actually scared in Nuevo Laredo when I first came in here, it wasn&#39;t that the organizations or anything. It wasn&#39;t anything like that walking at night by yourself. It wasn&#39;t nothing like that. My scare was to talk, and not because of anything. It was because like, they call it here </span><span class="c2 c8">alburo</span><span class="c2">. Anything I&#39;ll say, they&#39;re just like, &quot;</span><span class="c2 c8">Alburarme</span><span class="c0">.&quot; I didn&#39;t know what the hell they&#39;re saying, what the heck they&#39;re saying. I just know that were like smiling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I&#39;m like, I can feel the vibe. I&#39;m like, &quot;Wow, man.&quot; I don&#39;t know about it. I&#39;m like, &quot;Ah, </span><span class="c2 c8">me estan alburando</span><span class="c2">.&quot; Like, &quot;Man, watch. I&#39;m going to learn this language.&quot; So I learned a couple of them already. So I guess it&#39;s like the bad words or the bad phrases, but yeah. I was scared to talk because they do that a lot. </span><span class="c2 c8">Alburar mucho</span><span class="c0">. Yeah. It&#39;s crazy. So I was scared to talk, but no. I don&#39;t feel like going... I&#39;m not going to go back because anywhere that I can&#39;t enter legally, then it&#39;s just I&#39;m limited, and after seeing here that I&#39;m not limited, I might be limited at the moment for the resources, the connections that I haven&#39;t made because there&#39;s a lot of programs. There&#39;s a lot of organizations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like right here in New Comienzos. This organization right here, what they&#39;re doing, what they&#39;re providing right now, we&#39;re getting certified for some being an interpreter. So, yeah. You know, and just the connections here and just the vibe here, and the people that are actually doing this. The person that&#39;s from recording this to organizing it, that they&#39;re coming over here. I mean, just that to me, those are the resources, and not just the resources that they provide, but the capability of these individuals that are able to provide. I just want to say y&#39;all are awesome. Right, guys? Y&#39;all are awesome. I just wanted to make sure I somehow in an interview, I&#39;d throw that out there and y&#39;all guys are awesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I definitely see where y&#39;all get... I see the inspiration. I feel the feelings whenever y&#39;all are talking on why y&#39;all doing this type of stuff. So I just wanted to just say real quick, that&#39;s awesome. High five for y&#39;all, air five, but yeah. I won&#39;t enter anywhere that I&#39;m not legally able to because it sucks, and then you&#39;re going to go to jail, and then they ruin something else for you, but yeah. So no. I won&#39;t, and I&#39;m 30. That&#39;s 10 years and then it&#39;s not 10 years I can come in. It&#39;s 10 years you can start doing the process of your paperwork and all that. So it&#39;s not a guarantee that I will come in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for right now, I see that. No. I don&#39;t see myself returning back. I do have two kids that I consider my kids. They&#39;re my little niece and nephew. I mean, the other older ones, they see me as a big brother, and I&#39;m glad that I was able to have that; Gigi, JJ, Lauri, George, Leo, Jaime, Alondra, Lalo, Lena, Yiana, Letis, Tita, their family, their kids, hey, what&#39;s up? How y&#39;all doing? Love y&#39;all. Miss y&#39;all. But yeah, the two kids, my sister and me always have been helping each other out, and with the little ones, they really grew on me. So even the other big ones, but the other big ones are already big. So they are more of a big brother type of thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the other ones, there was even a time where like &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c8">Pa, tio, pa, tio&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;, which means like dad, uncle, dad, uncle. I like to be very straightforward with them, especially because I feel a lot if you talk to a child like a child, I mean, of course they&#39;re a child. So, you know yes. So be very clear, but let them know what&#39;s up, like what&#39;s going on. What&#39;s the reality of this world, you know? And like, so talk to them like adults. Certain things, I understand. They&#39;re not going to understand a lot of things, but the more you talk to them, the more that they&#39;re aware of it, then they&#39;ll start getting to that conversation, start understanding a lot of things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That time when they&#39;re like, &quot;Dad, uncle, dad, uncle,&quot; and they&#39;re hurting me inside because it&#39;s tough, but you have to be honest and straight up, you know? And I tell him that, &quot;Yeah.&quot; If they wanted to come, I&#39;m like, &quot;Mama, if you want to </span><span class="c2 c8">quieres hablar papa</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;,&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;That&#39;s what&#39;s up. I really appreciate that. I like that, but I just want to let you know that I&#39;m your uncle, and Ricardo is your dad. He&#39;s your father, but if you want to call me dad, I&#39;ll be happy for that. I would enjoy that, but I just want to be very straightforward with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just exactly like I said it. I told her. At the first times, I mean, she didn&#39;t understand what straightforward was, but that&#39;s what I mean by the more you&#39;re consistent with talking to them like adults. They start understanding the reality of this world, not just what the media and all this other stuff, but that&#39;s a different story, but yeah. Hi to everybody, and yeah. I won&#39;t return. I don&#39;t see myself returning back right now anytime soon. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adrian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you feel in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I feel in Mexico? In Mexico, I feel good. There&#39;s always different things. There&#39;s all these different things. That&#39;s what we have to understand. Now, but well, let me say a little story or something. This guy had a bar. That day he had his grandson sitting on a stool, sipping a milkshake. A guy walks in, looks around, sits down. &quot;Bartender, brewski.&quot; The bartender gives him the brewski. He drinks it. Halfway done, he looks around and looks at the bartender and says, &quot;Hey, bartender, let me ask you a question. How are the people around here? Because where I come from they&#39;re bad people. They lie, they steal, they rob, they&#39;ll even kill you. Like you&#39;re walking on the street. There&#39;s no hello, goodbye. There&#39;s&hellip; there&#39;s nothing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excuse me. I&#39;m cold.&quot; &quot;Well, you&#39;re cold. What you want me to do about it?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s raining. I&#39;m sorry. I have no place to stay.&quot; Like, &quot;Okay. Well then go find one.&quot; &quot;Yeah, just bad people. I mean, they&#39;ll lie. They&#39;ll steal, and they&#39;ll even go to the extent to kill you. They&#39;re bad people. So how are the people around here?&quot; The bartender looks around and looks at the grandson, and then looks at the man and says, &quot;Well, the people here? Well, they&#39;re bad people. They lie, they steal, they rob. I mean, you want something to eat, go look for it. You need a place to stay. What you want me to do about it? You&#39;re cold? Well, then I guess you should cover yourself up. You know, like they&#39;re bad people. No, hello. No good morning, good night, nothing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know? They&#39;re bad people here,&quot; and he&#39;s like, &quot;All right.&quot; Finish his beer, pays, and leaves. A couple of minutes later, another guy comes in, looks around, sits down. &quot;Bartender, brewski.&quot; The bartender gives him the beer, and then halfway through it the guy just looks around, and asks the bartender, &quot;Hey, bartender. Let me ask you a question. How are the people around here? Because where I come from, they&#39;re good people. Hello. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good night. &lsquo;Hey, excuse me. I really don&#39;t have nothing to eat right now.&rsquo; Well, you know what? I got some bread or I got some tortilla with some lemon and salt. I got some beans, some rice, you know? Here you go. Like, it probably won&#39;t get you far, but you&#39;ll have something in your stomach.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay?&quot; &quot;Excuse me. I&#39;m very cold right now&quot;, and I just and like, &quot;Okay, here you go. Here goes an old jacket. Here goes a jacket. Here goes something you can cover yourself. Here you go.&quot; You know, you are like, &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t have no place to stay. You know, and it&#39;s raining all that.&quot; Like, &quot;You know what? I don&#39;t know. You can&#39;t stay in my house, but you know what? I have a little shed here. There&#39;s a spot here that it&#39;s covered, and it doesn&#39;t get wet. You know, here you go. You know? Hello, good day. Good morning. Nice to see you. It&#39;s good people. They&#39;re honest. They help you out what they can. They&#39;re good people. So how are the people around here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the bartender looks around and looks at his grandson, and then looks at the guy and says, &quot;Well, sorry to tell you, but the people here are good people. They help you out. You need a something to eat, here you go, cold, here you go. Shack, if you don&#39;t have a place to stay or point you in the right direction, or they&#39;re good morning, good afternoon. They&#39;re good people.&quot; So the guy says, &quot;Thank you,&quot; finishes his beer pays and leaves. Now the grandson says, &quot;Hey, grandpa, why you told this one guy that the people are bad, and then you told the other guy that the people are good? Because it doesn&#39;t matter&hellip;&quot; And then the grandpa just looks at him and says, &quot;Well, mijo, it doesn&#39;t matter where you&#39;re at. It&#39;s who you are. If you&#39;re a person that says good morning, good afternoon, I mean, they&#39;re going to say, good morning, good afternoon. You know?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you&#39;re not talking about it, if you&#39;re stealing over here, then you know, people are going to steal, too. You&#39;re going to surround yourself around that environment. Those things are going to come back. So it doesn&#39;t matter where you&#39;re at. It&#39;s who you are, who you are. If you&#39;re a bad person, then bad people, bad things are going to come. If you&#39;re good people, then good people, good things are going to come. So you attract what you are, you know? If you&#39;re a jerk, you&#39;re going to attract jerks. You know? If you&#39;re good people, you&#39;re going to attract good people. You know? So it&#39;s who you are.&quot; Like I said, there&#39;s other variables as well. And it goes to that thing about the luck, things that we can&#39;t control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s where I use the word luck, but yeah. Things that we can&#39;t control, good luck, bad luck, to me, that&#39;s just things that you can&#39;t control, and so yeah. Bad things could happen. You can&#39;t control that type of stuff, but it&#39;s like, I mean, look at me. I got deported and I consider that something bad. I can&#39;t even visit my family. That&#39;s a big thing. I can&#39;t see my friends that I knew. That&#39;s another thing, and of course, the money, but I know there&#39;s money here, so I&#39;m not worried much about that, but the money I can make it over there. I can make it over here, but the family, I can&#39;t see them. There&#39;s some that they&#39;re illegals, too, so they can&#39;t see me. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the kids that I consider, that I attach to, they can&#39;t visit me. They&#39;re young, and I don&#39;t have an actual place of my own then. That type of stuff, I really miss, but yeah. It&#39;s how you make it of things, man, and so I don&#39;t feel... I feel comfortable here because I feel comfortable. I&#39;m a happy person. I know that good things are going to come this way, so I feel good. I feel safe. Things could happen. I&#39;ve gotten robbed from my phone. I have gotten in some situations here, but it&#39;s good. I don&#39;t feel that scared. Sometimes I get a little stressed out because of certain things, but I feel good. I have no problem walking at nights, especially, I mean over there, too. You have your areas where they&#39;re tough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here it&#39;s a little bit more because it&#39;s funny when you look at the cops here sometimes, and you look at them, and you can see that they&#39;re like more gangster than some other people there that are considered a gangster or something like that. I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s funny because there&#39;s some good cops here. I have gotten me some, and I know that I still find good cops, but yeah. I have had some situations where yeah, they have even... Yeah. It&#39;s some things here that... Yeah, so this environment&#39;s variables that come to play, but I feel good here. I&#39;m a good person. I know it, and so there&#39;s going to be good people around me, and just having got yet to meet everybody here yet, but there&#39;s time. I&#39;m not in no rush.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adrian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to say something just to finish the interview?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I just want to say one. I look at big pictures. I do. I really wish that I would&#39;ve had an opportunity there. I really do because I would have been able to... I wouldn&#39;t say do more with my life. I would not say that. Because even though there&#39;s a lot of... I have failed a lot, and out of those failures, I was able to gain experience in life in general, and I&#39;m blessed that my psychological ways, different ways that I can see this, just see things. I gained that a lot through failure. I couldn&#39;t control certain emotions, thinking that, &quot;How come everybody can&#39;t be good people?&quot; And all that, and you start understanding the reality of this world. That I won&#39;t say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that everybody should find out their own reality, so I won&#39;t share what&#39;s my reality, but I&#39;ll give you some tips. I mean, it depends on how you look at life. Even in a bad situation, if you look at the good things, then you start thinking more. You can&#39;t control your mind. It&#39;s going to think, and so just understand your mind. So understand that if you start thinking negative things, then more negative things come in your head, and all that. I know sometimes, especially for other people that get deported and are first new, and is in the same situation, I know that, hey man, it&#39;s going to be hard, especially if you really are a solo trip. You don&#39;t have no family here and all that. It&#39;s tough, but there&#39;s some organizations that do help you out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just hit the computer. Hit up that YouTube. Hit up that Google. Just start with one place. Go to one place. See what else they can connect you to. I mean, just get connected. Networking, too, and surround yourself with things that are constructive, and motivated. Yeah. Visit the chats. Those help you out, give tips and stuff, and you hear stuff. I know this deportation probably was something negative, and this journey, too, is I have learned a couple of things. So I just want to finish off with saying&hellip; one, miss y&rsquo;all, fam. Two, &nbsp;the people that... just go get connected. Go find out what&#39;s out there, because there&#39;s a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of help out there, so try to see which one fits you, you know? And from what you gain is you start knowing more. So you start knowing other places. There&#39;s money here, man. You just have to know how to get it in, and definitely it takes money to make money, so unless you&#39;re connected and you can just use connections, and all that, and start from there, but it&#39;s going to be tough for you guys. Well, it was tough for me, so I understand that situation, but your mind goes wherever you allow it to continue to think, so even though it&#39;s going to have its own thoughts, just say, &quot;Hey, you know what? Let me just concentrate on the positive,&quot; and things will turn out good for you, man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s pretty much it. Yeah. Have a great day, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak a little bit of it. I have much more, but that&#39;ll be for another time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Adrian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Miguel.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
