class="c5"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My story is I came back because I got married and husband was illegal, so his mom got sick so we came back to see her, because she got cancer. We were young. We were 20. He was 18. So he couldn&#39;t go back so I decided to stay here because he couldn&#39;t go back. So I got pregnant of two little girls. One was born over there and one&#39;s born here, so I can&#39;t even go back because I can&#39;t. And to this day I&#39;ve been living here for 10 years and then I got separated and I&#39;m a single mom now with two little girls, but I still can&#39;t go back because I&#39;ve got one little girl.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can or can&#39;t?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can&#39;t. I can, she can&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how old were you when you went to the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was three years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years old. And did your parents take you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you remember where you moved to?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. We moved to LA first, and then from there we moved up higher to Sacramento, California. And from there and on I went to high school and junior high.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you remember your first day of school in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I remember the first day. It was very scary. I was really shy. I&#39;m always quiet. Everybody was looking at me like I&#39;m the only Mexican one. But everybody in a week or two, they started liking me, and they started helping me out with English and what the teachers would say. The teacher would help me a lot. I have got luck with having good teachers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any specific teachers that you really remember?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mrs. Davis. She was in third grade, I guess. She would help me a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, was there anything specific that she did? Did she just really reach out to you, or...?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I didn&#39;t do some work because I didn&#39;t know what she was saying she would do it for me or she would help me out by showing how to do it. So, she was really nice. I passed the grade. But then from there I started to speak more English and understand more because of my friends and stuff like that, and plus my sisters.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How hard was it going...? When you started school, did you speak English?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not at all. Because my parents speak Spanish the whole time. So I grew up speaking Spanish. When I started school it was kindergarten, and then first grade, it was hard because my parents speak Spanish only at home. So in school you start learning and start listening to them, and then you start practicing with your little sisters and your cousins. But you start going at a different time, but it&#39;s hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did it take you to learn English? Do you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very much. I&rsquo;m a fast learner. I don&#39;t remember, really. I just know that I started learning, because you have to learn how to speak. School helps a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your friends, were they mostly American, or were they...?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they were all white.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were all white. I was scared at first because I would probably get discriminated alone. </span><span class="c8">At some times I did</span><span class="c0">. And then I started seeing more Mexicans and more Mexicans, so I started having more Mexican friends and white friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you had a pretty diverse group of friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did you start school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started school in Southern California.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you go all the way through high school and stuff?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I finished high school. I love Sacramento. Sacramento, I would not change it for anything. If I could go back, take my little girls, I would go back. The life there is much better than here. We struggle a lot here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you finished high school in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what happened after that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I started working, and I didn&#39;t know what to do or go to college for. My parents were getting separated, so I wasn&#39;t getting a lot of support on that so I stopped going to school. I started working in fast food stores like Popeye&#39;s, KFC, stuff like that. And then my mom has a cleaning company, so I started working for her too as well. And then I got married so I decided to come back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how old were you when you got married?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 20? 21?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you came back to Mexico. It was completely voluntary?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. And then I tried to go back, or I can go back, but my husband couldn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so why </span><span class="c8">couldn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;your husband go back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was illegal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you have your papers in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, my dad gives us the resident card, the legal resident. He&#39;s now, what do you call it? A citizen now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what was it like coming back to Mexico after...?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t like that it at all. It&#39;s different. Way, much different. I suffered a lot the first years when I started living here, but I was alone. But when you start getting used to it, you start... When you find a way to live a good life here, which you can, but you have to work twice as harder than over there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you know Spanish when you came back, or...?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. I never forget both of the languages because of my parents, and because my sister in English. Me and my sister speak a lot of English at home, and I watch movies in English a lot. I don&#39;t like them in Spanish.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your favorite movie?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I like comedy. </span><span class="c4">White Chicks</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;maybe?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a good one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And the </span><span class="c4">Night at the Roxbury.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I like the comedies and romance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway. So when you came back, did people treat you differently because they knew you lived in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. They couldn&#39;t listen to me. They would get mad and they would start hating, start talking bad stuff. Like, &quot;Oh, look at this. She&#39;s speaking English now. What&#39;s she doing here? She&#39;s speaking English. She should go back.&quot; Stuff like that. But I didn&#39;t really care. It was my own thing, so... Yeah. They do criticize you a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you miss about the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you miss Sacramento.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It&#39;s just the way you live over there. It&#39;s more easier to get your stuff, like your furniture and stuff like that and get a car, even if it&#39;s used. It&#39;s hard here. You can&#39;t even buy </span><span class="c8">food</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did you miss American food?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Which are not very... Because you saw it here now. But yeah, I miss it a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you worked at some fast-food places.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Popeye&#39;s and KFC.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are those the ones you miss?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have KFC here though, right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they do. Not Popeye&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the same or is it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. I think it&#39;s better over there. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you like Mexican food or American food better?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like both because I&#39;m used to both. I cook Mexican food, so...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is there anything that you don&#39;t miss about the United States? Is there anything that you didn&#39;t like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, I miss everything, so if I could go back, if it was in my hands to go back, I would go back with all my family.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are your parents still...?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents are over there, and they tell me that I&#39;m dumb because I&#39;m over here and they&#39;re all there. And I see them in San Francisco, in LA, in Six Flags, everywhere, and I&#39;m here working and stuff, because you have to work. If you don&#39;t work, you don&#39;t eat. And I&#39;m a single mom now, so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you consider yourself more American or more Mexican?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider myself both. Both because I&#39;ve been here a lot of time too, and there, because I grew up and finished high school, so I consider myself both.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your daughters. One of them was born in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the smallest one. She&#39;s seven. My parents helped me to go over there and she was born over there. The other one, they got mad because I came back, so they were like, &quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your daughter that was born in the US, does she speak English?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she doesn&#39;t. A lot of people ask me why I don&#39;t teach them. It&#39;s just because the school here really speaks Spanish, so it&#39;s not going to really help them a lot. She does get some words. She does call me mom. She does say some of the bad words. Yeah, she kind of says, because my cousin speaks English to me and my sister speaks English, so she gets some words.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you thought about going back to the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes, someday.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you have one daughter by citizenship?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s nine. If I would go, I&#39;d have to go without her first, so I don&#39;t want to leave her here. I don&#39;t know how long I would have to leave her here, so she would be really sad if me and my other daughter leave alone and leave her here, if we exclude her. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have the heart to leave her here. And plus, her dad is with some other woman, so...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dad is what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some other woman. So I think she&#39;s going to get really depressed if I leave.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is there any way to fix her papers before you go?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to go and have to go to the immigration and fill out some papers and try to fix it for her, but it takes time. It took us almost 10 years or 15 years to get a green card.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to get her over there is crossing her illegal, but I&#39;ll have to pay somebody to cross her, because that&#39;s scary. Some of the people don&#39;t even make it there, so...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s so scary. Well, first of all, do you feel like Mexico City is home, or Mexico is home?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s home, because you can&#39;t walk on the streets. I live in a place where it&#39;s not that bad, but this last weekend, there was some shootings and my daughter were in the park. She came running and knocked on the door. &quot;Open the door, because there&#39;s some shooting going around!&quot; And there was a robbery and the cops didn&#39;t do anything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you just mentioned the police.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He was outside. I think he was going around the park because I live in a circle the parks are on, and he was driving and I guess he bumped into a car and he shot them, but he missed, so he let him go. He was running with some guy, too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you trust the police here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I&#39;ve had some stuff where some issues where you try to report some robbery and they don&#39;t catch them or they don&#39;t investigate. They just go around in circles and they don&#39;t find the robbers. One time, they took my purse with a knife and I called the cops and they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, they&#39;re just hitting, so if you see them around...&quot; But they all look the same.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you trust the police in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. A lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#39;t stop until they get the burglars or the... Every time they try to investigate, it&#39;s not going to solve the issue or the problem. Yeah, I do trust them. They don&#39;t let it go that easy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does it make you feel that you were born in Mexico, but it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re home?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does it feel?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does that feel?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels really... I can&#39;t explain. It was uncomfortable, because you should feel like you&#39;re at home. You should feel like you&#39;re safe. They will inspect your&hellip;your benefits&hellip;I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US? Is that what you&#39;re saying?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. In the US I would get help with anything when you have a baby or something like that. Here? You don&#39;t get anything. That&#39;s why my parents are like&mdash;now that I had my second daughter&mdash;because they&#39;re like, &quot;First of all, they&#39;re not going to help you. No one was going to give you&hellip;the government&rsquo;s going to give you? They&#39;re going to help you?&quot; And it&#39;s true, they didn&#39;t give me anything. And it was very expensive here, too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you thought about migrating somewhere else?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because everybody knows the same. Here, there&#39;s a lot of opportunity with jobs because I have been living in some different other countries and it&#39;s hard to find a good job.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other countries?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Guanajuato. Like Guadalajara. They&#39;re hard. You have to live in the main city to get something.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think the United States shaped you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How so?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaped me like...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Created who you are. Do you think that you think in American ideals instead of Mexican ideals?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes, because my way to think is a lot different. Americans are very kind. They helped me a lot. Some of them don&#39;t, but most of them that I met, they helped me a lot. And I guess you get used to the way they talk. Every time you go out and say hi, it&#39;s just the way they are. And here it&#39;s... And they can tell if you&#39;re not from here. They always ask me, &quot;You&#39;re not from here, are you?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Because you act different. You&#39;re different. Have different thoughts.&quot; So yeah, they do create me. Even though my family, some of them live here, we think very different. They have a very different way of thinking. At home, they fight for everything. They fight for everything, and we don&#39;t because we had it in the States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This might be a little bit hard, but what&#39;s it like being a single mother?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single mom here? It&#39;s very hard. First, it&#39;s hard to find a job full time, because there&#39;s no one to watch your kids because you can&#39;t trust no one here. Two, there&#39;s no, what do you call those, </span><span class="c8">caretakers</span><span class="c6">, where they can help you. Even if you can pay them, they&#39;re not very much </span><span class="c8">caretakers</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and they&#39;re expensive. So sometimes I have to leave my kids alone. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does it make you feel that you&#39;re leaving your kids?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very bad. I can&#39;t even work. I&#39;m always thinking about them. I can&#39;t even call them, because I only have one cell phone. I do live with family, but they do their own thing. They don&#39;t help me to buy them shoes is really hard. To buy them uniforms for school, it&#39;s hard. They&#39;re going to finish school and I haven&#39;t bought one of the new ones, the sports one. And the teacher told me the other day that if she didn&#39;t come in with the uniform she was not going to come anymore. So she took the other uniform. You know how they have to wear two of them? So yeah. I was like, &quot;I&#39;m a single mom, I can&#39;t make it. I&#39;m barely getting by in my house.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do your parents in the United States, do they send you any money?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes. Sometimes. I don&#39;t really ask them for money, because they&#39;re like, &quot;What are you doing over there? Just come back.&quot; But I try to explain to them that I can&#39;t, or how do I do it? They just do their own thing. They do help me when I really need it, but I try to not need it as much. I think I consider myself independable. I think I can do it on my own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When was the last time you saw your parents?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad I saw, my mom, she never comes. The one that comes is my dad. It was last September. He comes every year, once a year.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&#39;s the last time you saw your mom?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in 2016? Two years ago? But I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll come back ever again, because she came for my grandpa&rsquo;s funeral, so she doesn&#39;t have a reason to come.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you consider going to visit them in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve considered that. I have to earn a lot of money for the trip. And the way to get there and have money to stay there, which my mom helps me a lot, but she&#39;s a single mom too, so I have more brothers and sisters over there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your mom and dad are separated and they both live in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. So I don&#39;t want to get there and just have my mom feeding me, so yeah, I want to get there and have my own money, but the situation here is really hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything you would change about the time you spent in the US? Is there anything you wish you&#39;d done in the US before you came back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, yeah. Changed something in my life?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not marry so soon. Finish, get a career so I can have a better life. That&#39;s all. And we really had...Well, here is a lot different from over there. I just wanted to finish my career with something. I wanted to be a nurse back there. And I wish I could&#39;ve finished that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you thought about going back to school here, or is that just not an option?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve tried, but it&#39;s hard. If it&#39;s hard at work to have somebody watch your kids, managing them all at the same time. So I guess we&#39;re just going to get used to just working at whatever we can.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned that you think a bit like an American.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you raising your kids to think like Americans too? Or how are you...?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s kind of hard, because they&#39;re used to here, and the way they think, their friends outside, they think differently, play differently. And if you try, you going to get confused. So I just let them be.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you celebrate any American holidays?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not here. Not here because they don&#39;t do it here. Maybe Halloween? Christmas, like </span><span class="c4">Navidad </span><span class="c6">or </span><span class="c4">Reyes Magos</span><span class="c6">. Easter, we don&#39;t, but it&#39;s very </span><span class="c8">rarely </span><span class="c6">but not very often. </span><span class="c8 c18">Pasqual</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m trying to think. I had another question, but now I can&#39;t remember it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you work now? You work with Telehealth?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I quit because I didn&#39;t have anybody to watch my kids, was missing a lot of work. I was getting here late. I would go to lunch, take two hours of lunch, which I was only supposed to take one. I would take them, get home, change them, feed them, make their lunch and take them to school and then come back. I wouldn&#39;t really eat. So I think I was getting very stressful. I wasn&#39;t... I was getting sick. And right now I was working in a fast food store, but they don&#39;t eat that much, so I recently just got another job at Marriott International Hotels call center, which is good. Just like Teltech. It&#39;s same thing, full time. I&#39;m going to have to pay somebody to watch my kids, which is going to take half of my check, but I&#39;m going to be much better. I hope so. And within the time they grow, they can watch each other. I&#39;ll find a way. I have to find a way to move on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that when your kids grow up, you might go back to the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes. Depends, because well, time passes by so fast, and I already spent 10 years here and I haven&#39;t gone. I don&#39;t know how much time I&#39;m going to be spending. Within time maybe my daughters go to high school here, and then there&#39;s just time to stay here. Maybe I&#39;ll help them get a good career here. I&#39;ll help towards that. That&#39;s if they want or if they&#39;re willing to cooperate. Because not all the kids finish school here because of money, I mean, or the parents. Some of them don&#39;t care. Which I want, I care, and I want them to be something when they grow up. Someone, one of them wanted to be a doctor too, and the other one I don&#39;t know yet, but whenever she&rsquo;s ready&hellip;I can have way to help her out and get her career so she can have a better life, because I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any contact with the father of your children?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he pay child support or anything?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I already went in and got help, but they came up with some stuff, different stuff. I was like, &quot;Ah, forget it. It&#39;s just extra time. I&#39;d just rather do it on my own.&quot; It delays too much. He&#39;s in Guanajuato, so I have to go over there, and he&#39;s way over there. But I don&#39;t have the source to go over there, come back, go back and forth, so I just wanted to leave it at that. The money that I spend on the trips, I&#39;m spending it on food or clothes. I&#39;d just rather leave it like that. And I bet he&#39;s going to do anything to just give me 300 a week, so it&#39;s not worth it. I think of it like that. I think it&#39;s going to be much better.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything you want to add to your story that I didn&#39;t ask?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, basically no. You did good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do appreciate you for listening.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&#39;s also important, because I know this isn&#39;t directly related to mothers and single mothers, but it&#39;s important to recognize that single mothers go through a lot, wherever it is.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I see a lot of women carrying their kids around in the bus, in the Metro, and they&#39;re struggling. I see in their face, because I think I see I have it in my face too, that they&#39;re tired. They don&#39;t know what to do. They wish they had a different life. And I just look at them and I see myself in them. Problem is they&#39;re just like me. So I&#39;m not the only one here going through a lot, but we have to move on. And they&#39;re dragging them everywhere.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you&#39;re doing a good job raising your kids, too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks. Yeah. I&#39;ll talk to them a lot. The communication with them is very important, because I didn&#39;t have a lot of communication with my parents. I think that&#39;s one of the weird things. Talk to them, talk to them, make them understand that what you do is for them. They&#39;re the reason. So I guess they understand, and they help me a lot too at home. Today, I got home and the bed was done and the room was clean. They didn&#39;t eat, but I fed them as soon as I got home. I do leave food so they can serve cereal, yogurts and stuff like that so they can eat on their own, they don&#39;t have to turn the stove on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there they miss the food they want. Tortillas. They want real food, so I get home and I feed them. So you get home tired and you still have to cook, so it&#39;s a lot. And the thing that I told you, it&#39;s stressful being at work and thinking that your daughter, your kids at home. Then somebody&#39;s going to knock on the door and take them. I don&#39;t know. Are they going to go out because they&#39;re bored or they don&#39;t want to do? They have to be busy at home. You think a lot of stuff because we see a lot of stuff in the news. See a lot of kids missing a lot too. We just leave it to God. Go</span><span class="c8">d is watching out for you. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you&#39;re a very strong woman.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider myself a strong mom, yeah. A mom. I have to, because if I put myself weak, no one helps you. Everybody tries to put you down, too. If you let them, they put you down. If you don&#39;t move on, no one&#39;s going to help you. They&#39;re not just going to give you anything. No one&#39;s going to give you anything. In the States, they do. A lot of people donate food, clothes, furniture. Yard sales where you go and it&#39;s cheap. Even if you don&#39;t go to yard sales, you can go anywhere and they&#39;re cheap. Here? You have to keep the same stuff for years. That&#39;s hard. My dad brings some stuff sometimes when he wants to. It&#39;s very rare. You to have ask for what you think. I mean, you&#39;d have to ask what you need and he&#39;ll bring it, but that&#39;s if he wants to. But we don&#39;t really ask. We don&#39;t want him to think that we&#39;re not good, because it&#39;s your decision being here. Yeah, I guess.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any questions for me?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I&#39;m okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much for speaking with me today.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karen:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, thank you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s great to talk to you.</span></p><p class="c2 c20"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c11"><tbody><tr class="c21"><td class="c16" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c7"></span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c5"><span class="c7"></span></p></div></body></html>
