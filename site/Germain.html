I mean you were born in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. </span><span class="c3">Mexico </span><span class="c4">City</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a second. Did you go to school in Mexico before you went to the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did two years. I did kindergarten and first grade. And that was like three years. Two years of kindergarten and first grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect. You didn&#39;t work here though?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No ma&#39;am. I&#39;m working now though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;ll come to that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times did you migrate to the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like seven.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You migrated seven times?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. The first time you left as a child, you went with your family?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, ma&#39;am. I did go with my family the first time when we left. I was around six, seven when we left. So it was just one day, I was young, my parents were like, &quot;We&#39;re going somewhere else.&quot; So, there was, I didn&#39;t know what was happening. Pero, they took me over there and then when we got there, everything was fine. Cause well, I got family that actually live in the States and they&#39;re legal, they&#39;re citizens. And they helped my mama to take her over there. So she brought us with her and then we got there at my grandma, well, my aunt&#39;s house and she kinda helped us out from there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did, did your mom and dad, did you go with both parents?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they leave, for economic reasons, because of violence, why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic reasons. My dad was working, my mom was not, so it was kind of difficult. We didn&#39;t have enough money to eat or buy food, clothing and stuff like that. It was four of us, my mom and my pops, my sister and me. And later on, right before we left, my little brother came up. So we took him, we took him also when he was almost like months, like seven, nine months old. So he never, &nbsp;So he a citizen now, because he did good. And right now through some of the opportunities that prior precedent had given, he actually got, he&#39;s going to school, he&#39;s doing great. He&#39;s not getting into no trouble, stuff like that. And my sister also, I was kind of like, I was like, I don&rsquo;t know the black sheep in the family. Pero, but yeah, everything was working fine. Pero, then I got into some issues. I had a permit, they took my permit away, they took my license away. Well, I ain&#39;t get in trouble physically hard, but it was just because driving without a license or driving on a suspended license, that&#39;s what kinda got me into coming back. So it wasn&#39;t nothing reckless like violence or drugs or nothing like that. It was just something in me that I had to do because I was working when I was, well, when I got there, I went to school. They sign me up for school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a second. Let&#39;s do a few questions because it&#39;s ... Let me ask you, was it hard to leave, do you remember leaving?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I remember leaving. It was not hard because in a way my parents told me we were going to a different and better place. So I was excited. And when we first got there, because we arrived at California, when we got down California, California is beautiful. The buildings and everything looks nice and everything. So when we got there, everything changed. It was a whole different world from where I was coming from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So let me ask because I&#39;m trying to do this at the same time. How old were you the first time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was six.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six. And the other times you migrated, you were?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like 16.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16, and then?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18 and then like 20 and then 23. And that was the last one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last one, okay. And every time you just crossed the border?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes ma&#39;am.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And you didn&#39;t become a US resident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t speak English. Obviously, you were a baby?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were six, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You learned English.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you learn English?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By going to school. With the school, when I got here, I went to, they did took me in and the same grade, first grade that I was in. But when I was, when I started school, I was in </span><span class="c4">_____</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Elementary up in </span><span class="c4">____</span><span class="c3">, Virginia</span><span class="c1">. And up there, because it was like in the near 2000s. They didn&#39;t have the ESL English as your second language. So that was not an option for me. So I kinda had to be stuck in the classroom with everybody speaking English, me not knowing anything. So it was a little bit difficult for me to learn it. It did take me one year to learn it, but it was because I was kinda like shy, going to a different place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was good, but at the same time, I was kind of shy because I didn&#39;t know nobody else at school. I couldn&#39;t speak to them. So it was a little bit difficult at the beginning, but then-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all in Richmond?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh(affirmative) All in Richmond. And from there I started learning English and then I started talking to people doing a whole lot. I did fail my first grade because I didn&#39;t know anything, but then they started with the ESL, so they put me in that class and that&#39;s what helped me out, started learning everything, kinda seeing how everything works, the verbs and all that. How you got to pronounce them, how you got write them down and stuff like that. So it did help me out. And from there to here, not here but you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got my GED.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got your GED? Okay. Wait a minute, so you went to school, I got the questions here. So just a second. Okay. You got your GED?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh(affirmative)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where did you live? You lived in Richmond, Virginia. And where else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole time in Richmond? Okay. Were there a lot of Mexicans in Richmond?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Back when I was there, I was like the, I was the first ones. There was no convenience store, &nbsp;aqui como, like, yeah, Latino stores. Anyways you couldn&#39;t find no tortillas, no tacos, nothing like that back then. So it was hard pero, but and we made it. It was nice how right now that I see my brother and my sister still live up there and they send me video so I talk to them through FaceTime and stuff like that. So I see everything, and now everything has changed. You see a whole bunch of whole lot of Spanish people up there now, which prior to us, there was nothing, not even ESL in the classrooms. So it was like, I went to, you could say a white school because I used to live by, not in the high area, but in mid class. And it was majority like white people there. So it was real nice. I lived the area was nice, everything was clean. I liked it. It was different from over here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then from there, we always stayed in Richmond, but different locations in Richmond. We rented an apartment first, then my mama bought a house. We lived in a house for like seven, 15 years. And then from there, my mama sold the house and got a, bought a trailer for my brother so he could stay there and stuff. Because my mom wanted to leave already also. So by me being deported, coming up here back to Mexico, I&#39;m going now in three years being here. Well, I just turned three years this year that I just came back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because within those three years, my momma kinda seen the struggle that I was going through, so she decided to sell her house up there, gave my brother like a fifth wheel, like an RV. And so he could live there like a trailer park. So he&#39;s living in a trailer park. It&#39;s his trailer. So my mama bought it for him. So he doesn&#39;t got to pay that much rent, just the floor space and lights and water. So they let them settle over there and she decided to come down here to help me out as far as where to stay and stuff like that because I was staying with my grandma. But it&#39;s not the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when did she come back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s going six months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. So you kept trying to get back to her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you didn&#39;t...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to, I didn&#39;t want it to, but my options that I have were not ... Because if I get caught one more time trying to get over, I was doing maybe like seven years for a year, just for getting caught trying to cross over. Well, it&#39;s not worth it to me spending seven years in prison for nothing really major that I&#39;d rather stay right here those seven years and try to struggle, well struggle a little bit, but be b free. Instead of being locked up. Because I was locked up prior to this. I was locked up three years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years in jail, for what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For repeatedly, reentries and driving with no license, stuff like that, driving on suspended, all that backed up on me. So they gave me time for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to figure out all these questions. So give me a sec. So you got your GED. Let&#39;s come back to some of these things. Okay. So you worked in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes ma&#39;am.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of jobs? And then we will talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What fast food?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chick-fil-A,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chick-fil-A.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olive Garden, Fridays. And then I went to a mechanic shop for a year, something like that, change brakes, tire stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one second. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you&#39;re fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how many years did you work in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was 16. I worked like 10 years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years. Okay. And your last job in the US, how much did you earn in an hour?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.25 an hour. No, I&#39;m sorry. I was like, I was getting, it was eight hours, nine hours. It was like $11, $12 an hour. I was making $125 a day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who did you live with in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your siblings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, my brother and my sister.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anybody else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you frightened at the US authorities?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Not necessarily because there where I live, it&#39;s the Commonwealth and I wasn&#39;t afraid because they don&#39;t do nothing to you. It was just whenever you get in trouble, that&#39;s when you get afraid. But if you were not doing nothing illegal or nothing bad, the cops wouldn&#39;t even come just harass you or anything like that. Or they see you driving just because you&#39;re Brown, they wouldn&#39;t pull you over. So that was good. So they helped out because I wasn&#39;t fighting. The whole time I was up there I wasn&#39;t fighting until I got locked up. Then when I got locked up, then that&#39;s when all the process started about being there illegally and this and that. So that&#39;s when it all started, but from there, afraid of the authorities, no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. I want to talk to you for 10 minutes, just about all of this, but I want to go through the questions. Let&#39;s just go through the questions with a yes, no, whatever. And then let&#39;s talk. Did you send money to relatives in Mexico? Did your family send money?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About how many times a year?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, like a year?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about, maybe you could say 12, once a month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much roughly every time do you think?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right around 15 to $2,000. 1500 to 2000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. And how many years did you live in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like 17, 18.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you follow US news when you were there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like follow?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I watched the news, but I didn&#39;t buy the flyer, the US news. No, but I did watch the news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On TV?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative) on TV.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you follow Mexican news?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes also to see what was going on down here with my grandpas, grandmas and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By TV?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By TV, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your brother&#39;s qualified for DACA, but you didn&#39;t and you didn&#39;t. And you didn&#39;t qualify because?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I had a re-entry and that&#39;s when I was 14. That&#39;s the first time that I came back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a re-entry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were deported before you were 14.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well, I came back voluntarily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh good. Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to visit after being gone for 10 years. I came back to visit my grandma, see how she was doing and stuff like that. Like I said, my uncles, they&#39;re citizens. So they were driving from Virginia down to Mexico. And they told me if I wanted to ride with them, but vacations. I finished my school by then, well, working on my GED because I did get into some problems at school. And I got forced into finishing my GED, if not the school was going to press charges against me. Because one day partying and I had to go to school. I was in high school, ninth grade, so my parents were at work and they had an extra car at home. So I drove the car to school. I didn&#39;t live too far from the school, maybe five minutes, eight minutes driving. So I just had to take the car. But also I stopped at the store, grabbed some beer. So I smelled like alcohol at school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they pulled me over, well, they didn&#39;t pull me over, but the teacher told the administrator and they came, got me with the cop and stuff like that. So they said that I was with, what do you call it, that I had ... and I had cigarettes on me. So they told me I had tobacco. I was under 18, so I couldn&#39;t have tobacco. I smelled like alcohol, they said that. They said that I had the keys to the car, so they call my parents, so they could go pick up the car. They suspended from school, then the school wanted to press charges against me for me taking or smelling or having an alcohol in the school zone, stuff like that. So they were like, &quot;The only way that you could beat this is if you get your GED before your court date. If you get your GED before your court date, that means that you&#39;re finished with school. You don&#39;t have to worry about school anymore. And the charges will be dropped.&quot; So they gave me a three month period to get my GED. So I did get it within a month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you were only in ninth grade?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. But I was like 17, I went to the GED, the general, the adult center, and I got it done there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re smart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I did it, I did fail one test and that was the history, but the US history. And I did have to pay like what, like $50 to retake that test. But I paid and retook it and I passed. So it was nice. So they gave me my diploma. They did graduation date and stuff like that at the GED center. So it was nice. I was like finishing high school, but a smaller group and with elderly people. So it was real nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after that, I did send a copy of my GED to my school and to the lawyer. And then from there, they told me that the court that was dropped, they were not pressing charges because of my GED. So that&#39;s how I got my GED at the ninth grade. So by 17, 16, I was already out of school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Good for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s when I started work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s how you started working. Why do you think you got into trouble and your brother and sister didn&#39;t?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the people that I got around with, maybe not following the good, your mama word, not hanging out with that person and this and that. That got me into a couple of things that I shouldn&#39;t have done. But my brother&#39;s seen me struggle. My sister&#39;s seen me struggle as far as also drugs, alcohol after finishing school and stuff like that. So then I got locked up. My brother&#39;s seen me locked up, he seen how my mom sometimes she was sending money. Well, my mama, she was working, so nobody really came to see me when I was locked up. So it was kinda difficult. And my mama was kind of scared because whenever you go to jail, they asked me for your ID. If you don&#39;t have a USA ID, you can&#39;t get in, and sometimes they don&#39;t let you out either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was, I want to see my son, but if I go, I might not come out this or that. So I&#39;m not sure, but I think it was stressful and I&#39;m pretty sure my brother seen all the struggle that my mama went through, what I put her through and all that stuff. And I talk to him, I give him advices on how everything works or how we do stuff. And he sees it and he&#39;s like, &quot;I see.&quot; He&#39;s seen the struggle that I&#39;ve been through, what I did, what happened to me, what got me into this, he&#39;s seen that I lost everything that I had. I had two cars, I had apartment, I had everything, but I lost it. And some of that stuff I had to pay for rent of like for court fees. And one of my cars that I sold, I had to pay court fees and stuff like that. So that way I won&#39;t owe the States nothing for tickets or anything pending.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Geeze. Were there gangs in Richmond?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It weren&rsquo;t as far as like LA, Latino gangs and stuff like that. Up there was more Bloods and Crips, red and white, well, black and white, because there were no Hispanics. So it was more like white people versus black people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you belong in one of them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn&#39;t. I kinda stayed neutral. I had friends that did, but I never got into that because there was stuff that they had to do that I wasn&#39;t willing to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like robbing or sometimes they tell you, you got to go try to kill somebody or stuff like that. I&#39;m not willing for that, because that is somebody&#39;s life that you taking away for no reason just to get respect. To me that&#39;s not respect. So I never got into it. Like I said, I do have friends and they did get me into some trouble because being with them. But other than that, I never actually. I do have tattoos, but none of my tattoos mean no gang member symbols or nothing like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a Mexican in Richmond, were there Bloods and Crips? Which gang do they join, do they join the white gang or the Black gang?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gangs majority at the time. Yes. Like I said, first of all, I lived in the suburbs, in the real nice area. It was at a whole bunch of white people, no disrespect no thing, but it was a whole bunch of white people. But then I moved to the South side, South side of Richmond. So it was crazy. The word ghetto, the stray, it was bad. Apartments coming down and stuff like that. It was nothing like the North side of Richmond. So it was nice, but I hung out with a whole bunch of Black people. We could say African-Americans. So I was always with them, because, well, I&#39;m Brown skin. I was a little bit darker because I was in the sun a lot and I had cornrows all the time. I got curly hair. So when I had it long, I got an Afro. So I kind of blend them with them. They always used to pick on me up to today, you Puerto Rican, you this. But when I tell them that I was Mexican, they didn&#39;t believe me because of how I dress, how I look and stuff like that. So it was nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also when I went on the North side where the white people, I still got along with them. I still have white people friends, but I hung out around more Black people instead of white because you blend them more. It&#39;s not like up there, it&#39;s kind of the Commonwealth, and it is a racial thing up there. But it&#39;s more Black and white, rednecks versus Black people. So it&#39;s kinda crazy. We got West Virginia, we got Washington, we got Virginia. So it&#39;s hectic. You know over here in DC is a whole bunch of Black people, majority of Black people. Up here is white people. Down here, it&#39;s a little mixture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was nice, but I know now, I feel better being with my color than being with somebody else. Even though I work in stuff like that, work for them, but I just felt more comfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live just outside DC.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right outside DC ?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, in Maryland.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maryland. Yeah. I used to work up there by Maryland too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We used to be going up there by Manassas, up there by Maryland and used to go pick up our tires and bring them back to Richmond and stuff like that. So I used to always be traveling around there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just live right outside, in the suburbs in DC.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the suburbs, they look nice. There you got a nice view, nice apartments up there. I used to work for also for schools with this guy, we used to put in all the furniture for schools, like desk and stuff like that, seats, and build the desk and stuff like that. They buy them and we get our 18 Wheeler, we ship them to them, take them out the boxes, build them and place some inside the school. So I was in a couple of schools up in DC. So it was real nice. And that was one of the highest paying jobs I had too. They pay me like 15 an hour for that. It was nice and it wasn&#39;t hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have a lawyer helping you when you were in jail?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh(affirmative)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long were you detained?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years total.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Virginia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;County jail?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal. It was County, but it was a federal prison. I was doing County time in federal prison. So I was sent there with the big dealers. I met a couple of big dealers in there when I was locked up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they put you in federal jail?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was a federal case that I had for re-entry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For re-entry?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s a federal case. It&#39;s not a state. And because there&#39;s the Commonwealth, up there majority of the cases are federal. So they did for me in a federal prison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did any authorities reach you when you came back to Mexico? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you been back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you live now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I live in the state in the County la ciudad en la estado de Mexico in the States, right outside the city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And who do you live with now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now with my mom. Like I said, my mom just came back, so I&#39;m staying with her now. I was living with my grandma prior to it, but my grandma she&#39;s elderly and my aunt, my uncle lived there and we got into conflicts. Because my grandma, she will, well, she always cooked. So when I worked late or stuff like that, she used to be up and they used to get mad because that&#39;s not your son, why you giving him food, this and that. You know family problems.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know programs that help people like you who have been and have returned?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard, but I&#39;m not sure if they can. I heard that there is a couple departments or couple of places that actually try to help you out or try to give you something to help you when you first come back. I didn&#39;t know that three years ago. So I just look myself, had to find myself. I didn&#39;t know jobs, like right now, right here in the city, I didn&#39;t know about the costs and stuff like that. So all this is new to me. I never worked or been in a place like that or work like that. So I was always like physical work. So right now it&#39;s easier. The job is easier, but it&#39;s far too though. Because I need like an hour and a half, two hours to get here. So I wake up at 4:30.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you studied anything? Since you&#39;ve been back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to. I went here to try to get my computer for school, not for school, but do computer career. Then you get a certificate that you know how to work a computer, this and that. I was working on that, but it was getting a little expensive. For it, I wasn&#39;t able to finish it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;ve worked to pay, what jobs have you been, call centers and what else? Just call centers?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s it. Like physical work, you could say like a waiter, &nbsp;at a -- not a restaurant, but a little fondita or something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much are you being paid for your current job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now? I&#39;m getting paid 55 an hour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55 pesos?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55 pesos an hour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel safe in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ve been the victim of a crime?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I got robbed. Maybe the way I look. I like to dress nice, I always did. I&#39;m not sure, but always seeing how people will come by out here dress nice. And I always wanted to be the same person. So regardless if I&#39;m here from there, I always try to dress nice or look proper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And maybe sometimes, well, you know what they say, if they see something shiny, they could get something out of it or anything like that. And I think, well, I don&#39;t look that dangerous, you approach me, you think, I could take him, don&#39;t worry about it. So I look harmless. They did get me pero, they just took my stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel more vulnerable with somebody who lived, who grew up in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m vulnerable, what do you mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you stand out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Right now because I don&#39;t get my glasses too, but I got glasses and I do stand out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is difficult to come back to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read you some things and then I want to quickly finish this and ask you about why is it that you returned. So what is it difficult to find a job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, yes. When I got here, I was six months without a job prior to finding my first call center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about other economic challenges?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, as far as how to get here, because in the States I had a car, I used to drive anywhere everywhere. Right here, I don&#39;t have a car. So I got to try to figure out how to get there through the buses, through Metro, through everything. So it&#39;s a challenge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing your education, yes you said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being separated from your family?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but right now they just came back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, just your mom, not your brothers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so still we&#39;re separated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a network of friends. Was it hard to make friends here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it harder, was Spanish and language hard?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really because my mom, she always spoke to me in Spanish and she always got us stuck like, even if you learn English, you still going to know Spanish. I maybe wasn&#39;t able to write it properly or maybe some other words I wasn&#39;t able to pronounce or say properly, but I&#39;m working on it too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about adapting to Mexican culture?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a little bit difficult due to the fact that you right now, July is coming, 4th of July, Thanksgiving, all that. It is different because up there we used to celebrate, we used to get together, have a big family reunion and stuff like that. Right here we don&#39;t do nothing. So it&#39;s a bit harder you could say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You used to celebrate 4th of July and Thanksgiving?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Everything. 4th of July, Thanksgiving, Halloween, all that. So it is different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about discrimination, have you faced discrimination here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Like I said, when I got here, I spent like I said, three years in jail. So when I came out, I had dreadlocks. I had always long hair so by the time I came out, my dreadlocks were already big. So when I got here, everybody looked at me different because I had dreadlocks and even though I dressed nice, I still had dreadlocks and long hair. So people would always look at me like, he a drug addict, this and that, he&#39;s going to rob us and this and that. Then my grandma&#39;s started telling me, no, you got to start looking dressing nice, she told me, clean up your hair, this and that. So I did cut my hair. I did start doing a little things. And they stopped looking at me. I stopped sagging my pants, stopped all that stuff that was maybe putting me or standing out a bit more than right now. Even though I stand out a little bit, back then I was standing out more because I had dreadlocks, I had baggy clothes, stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came down here, I went to the mall and the cop followed me and my aunt all the way around the store, just because I had the dreadlocks and I was kinda baggy. And my grandma and my aunt told to the cop like, &quot;What you&#39;re doing, you ain&#39;t got nothing else to do with? We ain&#39;t going to rob nothing. We got money to pay for this and all our stuff.&quot; And he was like, &quot;Well, I ain&#39;t doing nothing.&quot; But we was like, &quot;Sir, you following us. We go over here, you come over here. We go over there, you go over there. What are we doing to you?&quot; So it was difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you depressed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, I was because I was like, what am I going to do, can I make it? Started having like I said family problems with my uncles, my aunts. So it was difficult. And I believe that&#39;s why the reason my mom left everything and came down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any substance abuse?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, no. I drank but occasionally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you came back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you still have family living in the United States, your siblings, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&#39;re US citizens, no?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative) They&#39;re working on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Have they come to visit you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. My sister&#39;s thinking or trying to come maybe this year, but my nephew did come, well, my sister&#39;s son, he came. He&#39;s like 11 now. So he came down to visit. I spent time with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your cousins are US citizens?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I&rsquo;m going to add that. Do you currently follow US news?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through social media, TV?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">TV. Okay. Do you think you&#39;ll return to the US again?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, but I&#39;m not sure. I got to think about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be for economic reasons, violence, discrimination, family reunification, just to visit?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic reasons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got it. Okay, and if you don&#39;t, why would it be?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because like I said, I&#39;m not going to give up the federal court seven years for no crime, which they got people out there that are murdering and stuff like that. And they get five years, three years. And for you trying to get a better life, you get seven, eight years. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you volunteer in anything? Do you do any volunteer work or participate in anything here? Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well in Mexico, not volunteer work, but participate, no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So I have one question for you because I know you got to leave. </span><span class="c1">I want you to get your photo and ask the question. Why did you keep trying to go back to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the lifestyle, economic reasons. In the USA with $10, you could eat. In Mexico with 10 pesos, 50 pesos, you cannot eat. You cannot go with, let&#39;s say a hundred pesos to McDonald&#39;s to get you a decent burger and everything. You cannot eat here. You could go to the Sates with $5, you get a whole meal. So it&#39;s there like economics. Over here, everything is expensive. They don&#39;t pay as much and the work is harder. So that&#39;s the main reason I would go back for is to save some money and make some money and maybe come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you tried to go back how many times?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time it was for economic reasons?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative) Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about to be with your mom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the same thing because my mama was up there and I came. The first one, like I said, I came by myself. Then I went back I got caught. That was my first re-entry. So that&#39;s when I was done for everything, all the projects, all the applications, everything that they started coming up with, I missed out on that. But I&#39;m glad my brother, my siblings did get and are taking advantage of that. As long as they are good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you in a word could explain what it&#39;s like to be separated from your family, what would you say?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O man, it would be, I don&#39;t know in one word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t have to be one word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, but it would be, I&#39;m not sure. Stressful, hard. I don&#39;t know, to me, it was the whole, not the whole world coming down, but it was kicking you out and you see what you can do. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know how to explain it, but it is hard though because prior to my mama coming over here, it was like five years since I had seen her when I was locked up, and then the time that I&#39;ve been here. So it was difficult. I mean, I talked to her, but it&#39;s not the same. It&#39;s not the same loving or caring that you actually have, or you could see. So I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s difficult, it&#39;s hard. And there is no word.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you, do you think your mom would come and talk to us?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s because she, she doesn&#39;t have a bad leg, but she cannot walk a whole lot. So she&#39;s a little bit of not, well, she as a little bit overweight, so it&#39;s difficult for her to move around. And like I said, we don&#39;t have no car, the Metro stuff like that. It&#39;s going to be a bit hard. So I&#39;m not sure. I will have to ask her, but I wouldn&#39;t be able to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much does the transportation cost?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s 31, because I took the train. I live </span><span class="c3">[inaudible 00:40:22]. </span><span class="c1">20, the Metro, 20 the train [inaudible 00:40:27]. So it&#39;s 31 [inaudible 00:40:29] like 16.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it would be really wonderful to be able to talk to a mother who&#39;s come back for her son.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would? Like I said, I could ask her, I can not assure you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean we&#39;re giving you 200, tell her we&#39;re giving her 200 pesos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I let her know. And I confirm with-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you leave your number?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, pero yo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I can give you my phone number too, so you can WhatsApp me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Germain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll give it to you now. Do you have any pictures ...</span></p><p class="c0 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="t.58fae85fc1d07e1493d51db806e6dac2eec81174"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c7"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p></div></body></html>
