So to start, could you tell me a bit about, just like your life in Mexico? And what led up to your family&#39;s migration to the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. It&#39;s a little bit difficult, the situation we&#39;re encountering at that time. Because there were some political stuff going though on that time for my parents, for my dad. We were led to this necessity or need for my dad to migrate. So we were somehow threatened by these people, Zapatistas. They were organized people who went against the government, taking up the territories for some other reasons I really never knew. It&#39;s some weird stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re threatened. At some point, my family members were hurt, so my dad had to migrate to the United States looking for better opportunities for us, of how to at least have the things that we needed to overcome </span><span>in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;this life. Like anybody else who seeks for something better in life. That&#39;s one of the reasons ... two of the reasons. The threatened part and the ... which is the economic reason. Those basically are two of the reasons why my parents first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, after that, we were still in danger. Well, my brother got lung cancer and he was in this situation. So, my dad had to spend all this money that he already had earned and save up for returning to Mexico and he had also got help from the St. Jude. And he was-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in the U.S., yes. They were in the U. S. because he migrated with both of my brothers, two of my brothers, bigger brothers and him. So they were three.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my bigger brother got lung cancer, he got help with the St. Jude Foundation. </span><span>That pretty</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;much helped us a lot. So my dad got a request for my mother and my little sister, she was like four years old. So both my mother and my little sister, under the request of the government, she was allowed to travel on air. So she got over there, they got help from the government and everything. But then we were alone, we&#39;re still young.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is we?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my two sisters and my other brother and me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without your parents?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without, yeah. We were alone. Basically we were alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt very sad because you miss your parents, your sister, which you used to play with. And you basically miss them a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned that you migrated under somebody else&#39;s visa. So you were acting as a child of family friends or family members that you knew who were residents or had the visa?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, exactly. We had to travel first in airplane from Tapachula all the way to ... I think it was Matamoros. And then from there, my parents paid somebody else who pretended to us to be their child and with a visa from their child, we crossed basically legally. Then my sisters during the night ... they only walk one night. So they basically didn&#39;t took a lot of time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad really took ... he really took all his time to see the best way that we could travel without having any danger on the way. He found the shortest time to travel on the ground for my sister, so there are very safe</span><span>, t</span><span class="c0">hank God, and then we got to Texas. Then my parents drove all the way to Texas and they took us to Florida.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like, can you tell me some of your earliest memories like maybe your first day or first memory in the U.S. that surprised you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well what surprised me is first of all I seen a lot of watermelons in Texas. I think it&#39;s Texas. I think we got to the season where there was a lot of watermelons and I remember I just devoured them. I love watermelon a lot. And melons too. They were melons. I meant melons not watermelons. It was really happy, some very interesting new places, new grounds, new surroundings. Basically a whole change in your life. New language, something that you don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only knew how to say </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">father</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">mother</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;because my dad came twice, went twice over there and he just lasted one year. I think the first time and then the last time that&#39;s where he really got somewhere like a stable or some permanent work. And then that&#39;s how he can afford to request my mother and then us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said, you didn&#39;t know any English when you came here, everything was new.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me a little bit about adapting to the U.S. and learning English?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very difficult for me because we just went to school because we told my ... well, my mom and my bigger brother said, &quot;They need to study, they don&#39;t need to lose their studies. They don&#39;t need to lose it. So that helped us, my dad decided to take us to school. We started fifth grade, I didn&#39;t know anything. I just took some ESL classes, extended ESL classes. I know it was ESL. Something about extended learning-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, English Second Language.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative), English Second Language, I don&#39;t know, whatever. It is the same, whatever. It&#39;s learning the new language. I took ESL like four months and then they left us in our ... like, &quot;Go ahead, you can go ahead, help yourself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you think you were ready?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No</span><span>!</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I barely knew the ABC&#39;s and that little cow song. &quot;The cow flew over the moon and </span><span>everything</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;else.&quot; How is that going to help</span><span>&nbsp;me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>So, </span><span class="c0">after fifth grade, was that when ESL stopped for you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, only 4 months and then they stopped giving us ESL and then I didn&#39;t even request it. Math, it was something that you don&#39;t need English for Math. You know Math, 3 + 4, 3 x 2, you don&#39;t need any other languages, they&#39;re numbers. So there you can understand in any language basically, almost. It was a challenge for me, learning English. It took like one year to basically get along with it a little bit, maybe something like 20%, 30%.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next year maybe 40%. But for me, it took me like five years to really understand basically I could say everything up to what I needed to know. It took me like around five years, for the rest of the years, they just help me out to extend over new words basically. Learn more complex words and everything like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean obviously it must be really difficult adjusting and trying to take all these classes but still grasping a language. But did you like school stuff? What was school like for you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah. I really loved school. At some point, I was getting into that relation part of the life, which I was so shy and everything like that. And probably that made me go a little bit down on my grades. But then I decided I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I got to study.&quot; So I started to get up again, but that&#39;s the time where we got deported.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess this was back in high school then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s to the endpoint.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any memories of teachers or friends from school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t remember exactly the names for the teachers, but</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">one of the principal, Mr. Green from Middletown High School</span><span>, </span><span class="c3">I do remember him, he was not to be discriminated ... not to discriminate nobody, but he was a black </span><span>principal</span><span class="c0">. Or I would determine him by the color. Definitely, I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s African, American ... well I could say African American, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was an African American principal, he was very nice ... I met very nice black people. Didn&#39;t know any ethnicity differences there. But yeah, I met very nice people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D</span><span>id you </span><span class="c0">feel like you were starting to adapt to the American lifestyle? Did you like it, or no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was adapting to it, but at some point that was, you know, I got some point in my life where I think too much like a child and I got into trouble as a child only once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now I&#39;m 28.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how old were you when you got-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like 16.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16, what happened?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a fanatic to the video games and I didn&#39;t work at that time. So I was like, &quot;How can I finance ... How can I get what I love?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, but parents didn&#39;t ...&quot; like, &quot;Here, you want a video or some Nintendo game stuff.&quot; They didn&#39;t say nothing about that, so I was like, &quot;No, I got to get it on my own.&quot; Since I didn&#39;t work yet, I went into Best Buy, which is very interesting. You&#39;re going to hear about that right now. I went into Best Buy and I wanted my video game, my Gameboy Advance SP and I stole two of them. There were security things, but I don&#39;t know how I took them off the security box, I don&#39;t know how I was so ... Sorry for the word, some of them bad.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, but they almost got me. The security came to me when I was in the chair, but I felt something heavy on myself. Somebody was watching me. I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; I pretended to go back, &quot;Oh, I forgot something.&quot; I went back and I threw the Gameboy Advance SP somewhere on the video games place. I threw it, then I went back to the cashier and they caught me and they&#39;re like, &quot;We&#39;ve seen you in the camera.&quot; &quot;No, but do you see something on me, no.&quot; They like intimidated me too much. I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, yes it&#39;s okay. So I went over there.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, yeah, I had it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they took me a picture and they said, &quot;Your name and everything,&quot; and then my parents came for me in the detention center for I think it was for-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You went to the detention center?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was a detention center for like students or something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, like</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">youth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people, but it was like something like criminal stuff. But it was like for only young people. So I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay,&quot; when my parents said ... they didn&#39;t know a lot of English. They&#39;re like, &quot;What are you here for? What are you here for? I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh no, I wasn&#39;t in school you know how this, staying free or if you&#39;re young, you&#39;re forced to go to school and they caught me out of school. So that&#39;s why.&quot; And my parents are, &quot;Okay.&quot; And they never knew until we came here, I told them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you tell them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I told them. &quot;You know what, do you remember that?&quot; Oh they&#39;re like ... they cursed me out. I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say it as a joke or did you feel guilty?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say it as a joke. Yeah, pretty much like a joke. But the interesting part is here like when I came here, I look for the job. I don&#39;t know how, but I went into the campaign for Best Buy. I&#39;m like, &quot;What, maybe they&#39;re going to find my name on the record, no.&quot; I was afraid. But then after that afterwards everything was okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like also like 16, those teen years, it&#39;s pretty normal to have like an act of rebellion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, maybe that was my ... but after that, I came here and I don&#39;t know, I started thinking about the life. Well I&#39;d never think about the life until I was like 22. I was like, &quot;No, I need to make something in my life.&quot; And I started to think more better about the things, my decisions and yes, up to one point ... part of my desires could be rolled back to the U.S. but only for economic reasons, that&#39;s all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still play those video games?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No</span><span>, not </span><span class="c3">anymore. Now I play the cellphones like Clash Royale. I love the game, I don&#39;t know why. I think I need to leave it because sometimes I spend some money in there and I know, no, that&#39;s not the</span><span>..</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slippery slope.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, so I decided not to spend no more money on it. So I have like 4 months, I have not spend any money there, so that&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good. So going back to when you&#39;re in the U.S., can you tell me about the events that then brought you back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So basically I don&#39;t know if ... because they have control over everything, so probably they seen that my parents, or my dad, or my brother or part of my family members were trying to acquire something there. Probably like a property, you know, they have records of that, so they probably said like, &quot;Okay, they&#39;re going to acquire some property so that&#39;s not good for us.&quot; I&#39;m not assuming that, but they could think of that legally. So like, &quot;Okay, then is going to be easier for them probably to acquire some other benefits.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So probably they felt a little bit maybe afraid of that at some point. So I don&#39;t know, that could have been the beginning of the request </span><span>for</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;them, for us, to leave the United States probably. So my parents went in to represent themselves in front of the jury and they judge him about that. They ask him many questions, everything was fine, but my bigger brother only that I think he was intimidated. At some point he didn&#39;t knew what to say, so basically that was one point against us because it wasn&#39;t something that makes sense to them, because my brother was intimidated. He was old enough, but he was intimidated. You know feeling all that-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was your brother who had cancer?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was my other brother. He actually was a victim of that, so he had scars here. My dad told about them but my brother got-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A victim of what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the some of the-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zapatista.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zapatistas, yeah. Because they didn&#39;t ... if you were against them, they basically hurt you and he was very privileged of escaping. So it&#39;s pretty much difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so this is when your family was trying to make the case for why it&#39;s not safe for you to return to Mexico. Because the Zapatistas, I mean the government was like, &quot;Well, they&#39;re done</span><span>&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they&#39;re controlled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they&#39;re controlled. Did your family like ... I mean I&#39;m sure they did, but could you tell me about like the genuine fear they may have had about returning?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, one of the main things, like I told you during the previous interactions here, my brother got lung cancer. So it was one of the reasons that most of the money that my dad had </span><span>saved</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;up was gone. So basically we&#39;re on zero, like we were never </span><span>even</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;here. Plus the family things that we had to bought a bigger house to rent. More food, a lot of bunch of stuff we had to spend on. It was a little bit slower to get more money save up again. So we took a little bit more time ... we needed more time, basically, that&#39;s why my dad basically look out forward to the U.S. residence, but he was denied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me about I guess like ... I know it&#39;s difficult, </span><span>but how</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you felt and your family after the denial and the time in the detention centers before you were sent back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They felt pretty much sad and worry about the house because like I told you, my dad and my brother was acquiring a house, one for each other. Basically their incomes or their earnings were pretty much fine because they work at a construction site company. It was called ... well I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same name, </span><span>___</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Lumber. It was for creating the web design things for the roof board. So I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the right word like-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With like the B?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that one. Basically, they had a good incomes, they had good earnings and good salary, good trades and everything. So they felt like they could afford to payout a house. They got the credit, the house thing, for the house ... what is that called? I never use that term.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re fine. Like a mortgage or?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah like-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights or ... I know what you&#39;re saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know the terms exactly, because I never interacted with that term.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you&#39;re okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they got the credit for the home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, they got a loan?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money to be able to get the house?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like a credi</span><span>t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;more like a bank credit for-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current purchase.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they both got it. And they were start paying it. So their plans were to rent it after that or live because we are still paying the rent, see. So it didn&#39;t make any sense paying the rent and not getting the house. So he wanted to rent it, but since time didn&#39;t play on our side and definitely was lost. Money was lost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you mentioned you were taken to a family detention center in Pennsylvania and then did they fly you back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the service was very nice. Nothing to say against them, everything was perfect. They treated us nicely. Like I told you, they took us to Pennsylvania to the family detention center. It was very nice. They used to invite us, well the kids ... I was a kid by then like a month before to be in a-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18-year-old. But I was just still a kid, consider a kid for a month. So they invited us to go to eat hamburgers, ice cream, McDonald&#39;s, Burger King. But I don&#39;t know, I was a little bit lousy for that. So I stayed up like I said, to play soccer because that&#39;s my favorite sport. And I also like football.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your favorite team?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to tackle ... no, I</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c0">m really not a fanatic for any team. But I used to play too much in school with my partners. So yeah, I&#39;d love to tackle them. I really did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it just felt so n</span><span>ic</span><span class="c0">e. And when they tackle you, I felt like so strong because they couldn&#39;t move me. It was very nice. Yeah, I loved it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, sports can be a really fun break from the day and stuff. </span><span>So, then,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;can you tell me a bit about readjusting to Mexico? Were </span><span>you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like, &quot;Oh, yeah, I&#39;m in Mexico.&quot; Or were you like, &quot;Oh my gosh, everything is new?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. When I used to go over there I used to dream a lot to going back to my home place. I remember like the ... I don&#39;t know, like I </span><span>view</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;myself over there again. </span><span>I view the </span><span class="c0">place. Like if I was there, I dream a lot, going back. And I really told my parents, &quot;I want to go back. I want to go back.&quot; Even though it was a very nice opportunity, but as a child, you don&#39;t view those things. You don&#39;t see that. You don&#39;t see it from that point of view where you have to make yourself a life. You need to secure your future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, I haven&#39;t thought about it, so I was like, &quot;I want to go back. I want to go back.&quot; Until that time came I&#39;m like, &quot;Mom, we&#39;re going back.&quot; But at some point since I was like into that relationship stuff, I used to like love a girl, Brazilian. She was very nice, I remember her. I don&#39;t forget </span><span>her</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;even though I&#39;m in relationship right now, but I don&#39;t forget her. It was my first time feeling something for somebody. And it felt very cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you break up before you went back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, basically I told her. &quot;You know what, I want to tell you something.&quot; And she was like, &quot;What?&quot; &quot;I love you. But I&#39;m not asking you to going out with me.&quot; I was so stupid. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to go out with me, I just saying that I love you.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>She was like, &ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">But I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re not going to talk to me anymore.&quot; &quot;No, don&#39;t worry, we can be best friends.&quot; And she was very nice to me. But I was so stupid because like the same time I&#39;m declaring my love to her, I&#39;m saying I love you, I&#39;m like, &quot;But I don&#39;t want you close to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m like stupid and I was afraid. I&#39;m dumb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was dumb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you were young. You don&#39;t have to be hard on yourself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was dumb. Okay, whatever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you wish you had dated her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I really wished. I tried to contact her, but I didn&#39;t have an opportunity to get Myspace site and I really didn&#39;t thought about how to contact her again. I lost contact with her. I lost my </span><span>yearbook</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;because I left it </span><span>over</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>there</span><span class="c3">. I couldn&#39;t get anything, my </span><span>yearbook</span><span class="c0">, everything, my memories, are gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Facebook or anything?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn&#39;t have one and I didn&#39;t know how she was registered in Myspace or Facebook. I never got her to contact her again. So I was really sad, but then I meet new people and I still remind her still.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You still remember her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you want to contact her now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to contact her.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know. I would like to contact her really as a friend because I&#39;m somebody who, when I&#39;m in a relationship, I visualize myself like nobody else is on my way. &hellip;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I love to be like that, in my relationship, I love to be like that. But if I&#39;m going to finish somebody for love&#39;s ending which is ... Well I have a view of love. I think love is more than a feeling, love is a responsibility. A compromise that if you love somebody, you compromise to love her more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you think you learned that or where do you think that came from?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe from my family, I think, because basically my family&#39;s more loyal</span><span>.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, both my sister and I, </span><span>I</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;don&#39;t know where they got it from. I think they learn it. But me, no, I&#39;m very loyal and I&#39;m very responsible. Well, that&#39;s what I will think of myself when I&#39;m not, but I will think that of myself and </span><span>to a </span><span class="c0">point. Any point of view that you see. To the government ... not exactly to the government, but to their laws. If I go to the United States, I wouldn&#39;t like to go committing crimes, I would like to go visit, to work, and produce more than take off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that kind of vein of thought, if you had stayed in the U.S., what would you have liked to have done? What were your dreams?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was dumb, I wanted to go to the navy. To the army-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that&#39;s dumb?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, because you&#39;re seeking for your end of your history. So you&#39;re seeking for something that will probably take you away from your family, because believe it or not, </span><span>it&#39;s</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;something that gets you away from your family, geographically, talking about </span><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;need to distance stuff, but when it comes to comes to your life and death, yes, it will take you definitely away at some point if you don&#39;t run with too much love, you will. So, I think it was that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you think it&#39;s dumb, but in that moment, what made you want to join the navy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felt so cool, having weapons. Not really killing people, but having weapons. Feeling that you&#39;re fighting for the rights for other people, feeling that there&#39;s people on your responsibilities, there&#39;s a nation, fighting for a nation. Feeling you&#39;re so important to the nation that you could be one person that could make history. That makes me feel so full as a person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s dumb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe I got your aspect, if you think ... like you probably change a lot in growing from that kid you were then to ... So, now that you&#39;re in Mexico, do you have any different hopes for yourself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, well, when I came here, I wanted to be an English teacher, but since I have so many barriers towards my education, I had five years without studying anything until I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I&#39;m not going to stay here. I know something else, I got to get up. No, I&#39;m not gonna stay here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I used to do agriculture jobs and work in this place where they do the bananas and they export it to China, to U.S. and all over the places. So, I used to work in that place and I really loved that job. But more than love it, I enjoy it, but it&#39;s not something that can really make me grow. So, I&#39;m like, &quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many things happened throughout that period of time that made me take up on my course again, on my studies. And I decided to get in an adult education stuff, I think it&#39;s calle</span><span>d INEA. It&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like a institute for old people, 18-year-olds. Okay, adult people to study, to get their studies. So I started from elementary, middle and then high school, I studied along with other ... it was an open school for ... these are young people and old people. 43, 18, 20-year-old and old mates.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I finished three years of studies there, four years of studies in </span><span class="c7 c3">la prepa</span><span class="c3">, called </span><span class="c7 c3">la preparatori</span><span class="c7">a, for bacherillato</span><span>&nbsp;or</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;High School known in the U.S. and it was very interesting, I was one of the best students there, seriously</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;because even though I studied and worked at the same time, I have to because my parents didn&#39;t want me ... my dad didn&#39;t want me because he bought some ... I don&#39;t have the word in my mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got some agriculture land things and-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, like tools? Like machinery?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not basically tools but he got a big space for selling crop and now he got this to produce oil, it&#39;s a fruit that is very common here in Mexico now and he got a pretty much broad space. So, he wanted me to work there. He actually right now ... he&#39;s producing a lot. But I came because I didn&#39;t want the hard work, I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, no. It&#39;s not for me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he wanted me not to study so, I get studying until I finished my high school here, </span><span class="c3 c7">Preparatoria</span><span class="c0">. And I kept my studies, but I left it because so much difficulties in between the incomes and your studies, the time you have to dedicate to your studies, the time you have to dedicate to your job, you need to be responsible, be on time as well with your homework.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as well with your own personal stuff, like washing your clothes, cooking yourself. It&#39;s too much stuff for the small income that we have over there. So, I left my studies and then I started again in the agriculture without having a view of my studies again, having a goal to finish my studies and then I&#39;m like no, there&#39;s some difficult things that happen throughout that period of time. It was like a timeframe for four months and then I was pushed through, even though I have a girlfriend there. I was pushed through leaving her and I had to explain her that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I came here. It&#39;s a little difficult the distance between a relationship. Something that you have to give up sometimes for trying to get something better in life. And now I&#39;m here, never knew about any corporation, any company, any wellness or anything, any organization that can help us do this at the beginning. </span><span>Loss</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of time, 10 years, </span><span>loss</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of time to consider it like that or either I can consider as an experience. Depending on the way that you take it, I will consider an experience, and as well, a loss of time. But good things, I get to met new people. People that now form a lot, make part of my life. I&#39;m here now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah where do you think that drive ... because you mentioned this internal conflict of working back where you </span><span>live</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to have what your father wanted. But then you&#39;re like, &quot;No, this isn&#39;t for me. I need to come pursue my studies, I need to come to the city.&quot; Kind of a giving up some things, but then also like choosing to do that and going back, where do you think that drive to pursue something else in the other direction came from?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My future. I want to make something by myself, I want to do my own stuff. I want to get my own things. I don&#39;t want to depend on nobody saying that, &quot;I went to the U.S., I got these. And this is something that I left you for your future.&quot; Something that I worked on myself, take care of it. Well I really do love that. I really would like that. It&#39;s very interesting, it&#39;s very nice for you getting something that your parents really fought for that, work out for that, it&#39;s really nice and I&#39;ve been with him on the bad times seriously until what he is cultivating, producing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I left that when he was already producing, so, I pretty much helped him. I learn a lot of nice stuff, that I really don&#39;t regret it. The canoe, right? I learned how to manage that on the river, it was really nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love canoeing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know how to maneuver?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah, you got your steering-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a stick or with a steering? Oh, with a steering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, paddle, you use the stick?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;d use the stick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so, you&#39;re more pro than I am. I know a different kind of canoeing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, but that is more interesting. Sometime I use the steering, sometimes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you still </span><span>rudder,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;though, turn to-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I know. You had to know where, like [crosstalk 00:36:08] here or here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a good workout. If you&#39;re in the rapids, you got to move quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my gosh, I remember my canoe flipped over or-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You did?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the first time I used to do that, since it was a stick, I&#39;m like I push on one side, but I really know how to get direction and my canoe just went straight-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, once you get the flow of the river,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very interesting until I learned, not a lot, I&#39;m not a professional yet</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">but I did learn and I really love it but my future was part of the things that I&#39;m like I was viewing myself in the future, I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m going to be here, working out so hard when I can do something else maybe somewhere else.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of my things that were pulling me to stay there was the relationship. But my vision was different. Like, no, </span><span>i</span><span class="c3">f I really love her, I need to look forward to something else, because really I can go up with that, I can grow up with this, I can get a good economics lifestyle here with good earnings. But it&#39;s not going to help me ... I&#39;m going to be killing myself here for something like that, when I can be earning probably not the same but a little bit less but with less for it. </span><span>A</span><span class="c0">nd no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it was pretty much very said when I came here. And I recently, like a month ago. I went to visit her. It was very nice. After nine months, like wow. I felt so different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the change as a person or you just missed her a lot?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really as a person, I missed her a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just jump, I jump.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very nice, but I didn&#39;t tell her I was going, no. I told her, I was going, but it was a different day. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">I&#39;m going that day, okay, I&#39;m going to work. I&#39;m on break right now, just give me some time, I got to go to work.&quot; And she was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And then the next morning, I knock on the door and I already had talked with her mother, I&#39;m like, &quot;Don&#39;t say nothing, okay?&quot; And then I got her. She </span><span>awoke</span><span class="c0">. She was probably not in the best situation maybe when her dresses, but oh well. And he was like, &quot;Oh my god.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you surprised her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, she surprised her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, some wrap-up questions </span><span>before we end</span><span class="c0">, and you can take this however you want to but do you consider yourself Mexican and American?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider myself American, not in the way that being a U.S. citizen or something like that, because we are all Americans. We are all American. North America, we&#39;re part of North America, Central America, just around Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and all of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we&#39;re all Americans, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the reason that they ... &quot;I&#39;m an American.&quot; &quot;No, you&#39;re not only an American.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m an American too, okay? I&#39;m an American, I&#39;m a North American also as well. The difference is that you&#39;re in a different state which you manage different units, money units. So, you manage dollars, I manage Mexican </span><span>p</span><span class="c0">esos, but it doesn&#39;t make me any different than you. I&#39;m an American also.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a great response. And then going off of that, some people kind of say or when discussing migration or someone who&#39;s lived in the U. S. and Mexico as kind of this idea of being from neither here nor there. Some people talked about like being too Mexican to be American, too American to be Mexican. What would your response be to that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s a little bit interesting because in some way ... I met some people, but that&#39;s something that comes in between your beliefs. Because on my end, even though I would be born over there, I will feel U.S. citizen to be more clear, and not consider myself maybe a Mexican citizen. But if I come here and I know that my parents are from here, I will feel fully Mexican and independently from being American of course, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, some people are so more like ... how could you say, they feel their self on a higher level, and even though they don&#39;t realize that we are all humans, they feel themself on a different level, because of their habit, they&#39;re too like, &quot;Oh, homie what&#39;s up? Hello boy.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Come on, you can pick Spanish. We&#39;re in Mexico. </span><span>You</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;can speak Spanish. We&#39;re gonna speak English with people who really speak English. We&#39;re going to speak Spanish where people speak Spanish. Come on, </span><span>what</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;do you feel more than them? You&#39;re the same.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think there was kind of like a social hierarchy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think that is more because of that. Because they feel they have more money. They&#39;re more interesting, they&#39;re more cool, no. I think that is something that really, it comes from what do you have in between the social things, high socially people, low, medium. And I don&#39;t think that should exist. It does exist but we don&#39;t have to show the people so much of that, you know</span><span>. I</span><span class="c0">f I have money, if I am rich, if I am from over there, if I&#39;ve been over there 10 years and probably I grew up most of my childhood over there, that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m over there from there or even though if I were born over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I&#39;m here, I will be like anybody. Like hello? I will treat anybody ... when I find people that are really poor, they&#39;re carrying their bags or garbage or anything like that. Trust me, I really do help them. I really help them to carry. Right now I bought this cheap shirt. I don&#39;t care. See they, when I go to work, I use cheap clothes, cheap everything because I don&#39;t like to show off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I have the money for to buy it, but I don&#39;t buy it because I don&#39;t want to show off. I&#39;m thinking for the future, because sometimes I can save up for something else, see? And if I go to the U.S., it will be just to show off. But at least to get a little house, a patio, something that I don&#39;t have to worry about in the future. And I think that identity, whether you are from over there or here, you feel</span><span>&nbsp;uncomfortable</span><span class="c0">. That is ridiculous, seriously ridiculous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think that was a great note to end on, unless there&#39;s anything you&#39;d like to add</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c0">you want people to know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well basically, I don&#39;t think there&#39;d be much but I would like people to know, well if this is heard on the U.S. by U.S. citizens who are native from over there, I would like to let them know that they shouldn&#39;t have all of these barriers, all of these process just to go visit. Because when they come visit here, they don&#39;t make it a mess, come on. Their intention, well, I assume that the government has records for everybody who&#39;s been judged, who&#39;s been in jail, who&#39;s been a criminal. Come on, if you don&#39;t have any records of that, it should be a lot easier to get the visa, at least to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they put so many barriers because they&#39;re like, &quot;The job needs to be on site or on the website for at least more than six months in order for the person who wants you to go</span><span>&nbsp;h</span><span class="c0">as the opportunity to take you there.&quot; But no, why do they do that? So many people were there, they don&#39;t want to do the hard job, come on, let us do it. I don&#39;t mind earning $7 or $8 per hour and doing our work because it&#39;s a lot more money than we got over here now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn&#39;t mean they have to overtake on that situation and pay us so less, when we&#39;re doing the harder job that nobody wants to do, that we can afford to do, because we have the ... how do you say it when you&#39;re like we have the ... there&#39;s that lower standard, but is not a lower standard, like something to say like, &quot;I&#39;m poor,&quot; no. We don&#39;t care. We don&#39;t care-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could say the drive or you&#39;re willing to take those jobs, but there&#39;s a better name for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humility?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh humility?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, humility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39; perfect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so, we have the humility to take up those jobs, we don&#39;t care, see? We&#39;re not those people like, &quot;No, I have money, I don&#39;t have to do that.&quot; No, it&#39;s more about heritage in the city and </span><span>principles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Principles</span><span class="c0">, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yeah, its&#39; more up to that. So, basically I recommend them to make it easier. Not put a lot of barriers for people who want to do those jobs or at least have a better economic lifestyle</span><span>&nbsp;to be </span><span class="c0">more comprehensive, at least for the people who are legal over there, have no criminal records, let them go back with not so much process on. Because they already know place, they already know the language, they already know how they encounter over there, how they are over there. So, I think especially when it comes that we want to study or we want to take up our studies and we want to take it over there, it should be more easier. That&#39;s what I recommend them to take on more concerns about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think that&#39;s a big theme of our study too, which is that, who are we deporting? We&#39;re deporting really smart, passionate, intelligent young people, with little to no criminal or misdemeanor record. Who just want to make a life for themselves and be educated and provide for themselves and be educated and provide for themselves and their families and somehow we&#39;re punishing them for pursuing some that we consider the American dream, sort of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I completely agree that that&#39;s not an excuse to take advantage of someone&#39;s humility to do jobs out of necessity or because they&#39;re willing to because they have ... that you said, humility and that&#39;s a good word for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I also know the hardest job or the most worst job-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like laborious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like the cultivating like tomatoes, oranges, and even that water from the toilet and all those-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plumbing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>...</span><span class="c3">draining plumbing stuff, all of that stuff that you have to encounter, all the nasty stuff there, you know, I think those should be jobs that should be really paid off very well, not $6, $7, $8, $9 or $10 per hour. I think that&#39;s afford to pay more. They should pay more because those are the grossest job that you can get. And it should be very important, </span><span>because it is very</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;important. One of those just crushes, what happens? It is going to flood with all that nasty water, see?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if people who do that, they need to pay them more because basically, that&#39;s something that nobody wants to do, see?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I think the U.S., in terms of job markets and stuff is going to realize</span><span>, if we </span><span class="c3">keep on deporting people,</span><span>&nbsp;we&rsquo;re</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;going to lose jobs and there&#39;s no one to fill those jobs, there&#39;s going to be a hole. And yet those jobs are necessary, so, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should make a survey or interview to those people who are ... probably the ones who are arrested for criminal things, they should definitely be deported. But the people who probably just because they&#39;re illegal, I think they should be asked, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s your goal here?&quot; And if their goal is different, they could even give them the right </span><span>to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;work legally and keep track of them and see if they&#39;re really doing what their goal is or if they&#39;re really going somewhere else. See what I mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pablo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should take a chance to know the people, see? That could be a really great way to understand the real needs of the people and they&#39;re really onto that goal or not. And that should be taken in account to determine whether they really deserve to be there or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Isabel:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s perfectly well said. Do you want to end on that note? </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c5 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c15"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c3">Page </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c9 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
