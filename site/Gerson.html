All right. So again, thank you so much for coming and speaking with us because we came here. But I do want to say, before we begin, that I understand that sometimes talking about these experiences can be a little difficult, especially because they bring a lot of emotions that you don&#39;t necessarily want to feel. And I apologize if that is the case today. But I do think it&#39;s good to know how important your story is and how important it is for other people to hear it so that we can shed light on the realities of migration on the human side of migration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Yeah, no problem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my first question for you is, why did you or your family decide to leave Mexico? And how did you cross the border?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well the reason why we first went to the US is because my dad left Mexico City when I was four. So my mom, trying to follow him, you know, she decided to start saving money and we had a couple of jewelry that my dad had sent us. So my mom decided to surprise my dad, going to the United States one day. The way that we crossed it was literally crossing through the border, Piedras Negras, I believe it&#39;s called, the city where we passed through. And it was a rough experience to actually go through there because it was a full week of trying to go into the United States. And then when we actually crossed and we were able to get to Arizona, we got lost in the desert for two days because the guide that was guiding us to cross, basically took half of the group with him and then the other half stayed behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was really crazy cause, I mean, it was hot, it was cold at night, these wild animals, snakes. I mean, it was a crazy-ass experience. And I mean, I was six at that time. I was really young. My mom had a lot of... she felt she had a lot of injuries because of the same reason. It was a real, real tough way for us to cross. And once we actually were able to cross, we got to Arizona, and from Arizona we went to Chicago, Illinois.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, is that where you were pretty much all the time in Chicago?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope. Afterwards we got there, we were there like for three months with my grandma, from the part of my dad, and we were waiting for my dad to come and pick us up. So then when my dad found out that we had crossed the border and we were in the United States, he was a bit, I don&#39;t know, I wouldn&#39;t call it shook, but there was something going on because it was really suspicious that he just did not come and get us. So then afterwards, like a month later, he came and he said that we would have to go back to Mexico City because he didn&#39;t have a job and he wasn&#39;t stable and that basically he couldn&#39;t take care of us at that time. So my mom decided not to listen to him and told him that we had gone through a lot of things to just go back to Mexico City just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my dad decided to go back to Arkansas and said he would go and get an apartment for us. But the reality was that he had another family. So after like two weeks my dad left us, he called my mom and told her about he had another family, and that he was going to have a new baby, and that he couldn&#39;t take care of us. So obviously, it was a tough decision... I mean, a tough news for us, mostly for me because I was young, and my mom decided to go to Denver, Colorado. We stayed there for almost a year, but she decided we were alone, she was working and most of the time I was alone, I had to go to school alone. So then she decided just to go back to California because most of my family and my relatives are over there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we went to California for almost over than 11 years. And that&#39;s where I basically grew up and I got all my ways, I can say. So it was tough living in California too, because there&#39;s a lot of violence and there&#39;s a lot of... Being Mexican, it gets you surrounded in this environment of bad things because... At the beginning, when I was in school, I was really a good kid and I was an A straight student. I was doing really good in school. I mean, my teachers would always tell me that I was going to be able to get the scholarships, and things like that, so I can go to university. But then, so many things happened in my life that kind of made me basically change my whole outcome, discussions with my dad, with my mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual fact that my dad wasn&#39;t living with us really really changed the whole situation for me. So I started hanging out with the wrong people, started doing, I mean, the bad things. And, I mean, at the end of the day, it&#39;s like everything happens for a reason, right? So I ended up messing up my life. I wouldn&#39;t say my life, but I guess like at that time I messed it up because I was just so used to being in the United States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t think that you&#39;d ever leave?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, honestly, I saw so many of my friends going into juvie and prison, and they would go in, coming back, see them like a month later in the streets be like, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up? What happened?&quot; &quot;Oh yeah, yeah, whatever, this happened, but I&#39;m out.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; And then I decided to take my own decisions and go to the wrong path and started doing bad things and I got caught up and police one day got me, and the situation for me wasn&#39;t the same because at the end of the day, for me, it wasn&#39;t like I&#39;m going to go back to the streets, I&#39;m just... I could have been locked up for a long time but, I guess, one of my uncles, he&#39;s an attorney, so he took my case, and like I mentioned, I was barely like 17 at that time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, don&#39;t worry. So after that, my uncle helped me to be able to get a voluntary departure. So when I would turned 18, everything was at risk that I was going to be taken to feds, to federal prison, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my uncle fought for my case, we had to pay some money, and thank God, I was able to get released. But, I mean, I was literally taken to the border and I was left in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I&#39;m going to backtrack a little bit. So were you a part of a gang when you were in California?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah, I was part of a gang.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you say bad things, what sort of things made you get caught up with the police? If you&#39;re comfortable saying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, it&#39;s not like I did something... Yeah, I mean, I feel like I did something bad because I was smuggling drugs. I got caught up in that situation. I started selling drugs, and then one day I was driving and I had drugs in the trunk, and I felt like somebody had already put me on the spot. And somebody told police that I was selling. And next thing you know, police stops me and they start searching, they can&#39;t find nothing on me. And they&#39;re like, &quot;You know what? We have permission to open the trunk.&quot; And at the end of the day, there was a gun in there and there was drugs, and the whole situation just changed for me, from being free on the streets and living a good life, I guess. I went into juvie and I kind of understood that the path that I was taking, it was the wrong path, right? And I was doing bad things at the end of the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I guess I&#39;m grateful and I&#39;m lucky to say that I didn&#39;t do nothing else, a part of that. But at the end of the day I messed up my future maybe in the United States, being able to get a citizenship or something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What gang was it? I don&#39;t know if you can say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Why did you, then... going to switch that question. Why did you join in the first place? Like what was attractive about it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, for me, it was a gang in 4th Street in Santa Ana, California. And, I mean, the reason why, is because when I hit the first year of junior high, so I was in sixth grade, right? So I started meeting these people and, like I mentioned, I was an A straight student, I was doing pretty good. I really never had to worry about nothing. So one day I met this guy in school, he starts talking to me, he starts telling me that... he start showing me this other world that maybe when you&#39;re not related to all of that, it&#39;s completely new, and it just becomes radical to your life because it changes your life forever. And I started hanging out with his... My friend&#39;s brother was the one that was completely affiliated with that gang.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my friend started pulling me, &quot;Let&#39;s go to my house. Let&rsquo;s go to my house.&quot; And then my mom, she never really got suspicious about it. And I would go to his crib, his house, I would stay there, and next thing I was gang banging with them. I was part of that gang and I was asked to do things. And then I started meeting people. People offer me money to do certain things, and honestly, the California lifestyle, it&#39;s good but it&#39;s pretty expensive, you got to be able to have a good job or something... a good income, to be able to live a good life. But my mom, she had a job and everything, but I mean, I can&#39;t say I was rich over there, I can&#39;t say I was living a good life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I started doing this things, selling drugs, I started seeing so much income for me that I was able to help my mom, I was able to get so many things that I wanted. And I guess that that really, really was attractive for me. And then I said, &quot;Screw school, why would I want to go to school if I can make more money here?&quot; I decided to... I was still going to school and that&#39;s where I was making most of the money, because I guess I was just contaminating all these people in school with things that they never seen before or tried before. But it was just me wanting to get this money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because I kind of feel pressure at the same time, because you&#39;re in a gang where most of them are over 25. And then me and my friend were the only young bucks there... we were like 17, 16 at the time. So, I mean, I guess pressure is put upon us, but it&#39;s also a decision that maybe you&#39;re young and dumb and you don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re doing till you see reality when reality hits. So, I mean, money was my most motive for me to start doing things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, you ended up in juvie and then jail and all that. How was that experience? How was the treatment in those centers?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was kind of messed up because you had to fight a lot. There were so many things because you&#39;re from another gang, you&#39;re Hispanic, you&#39;re Mexican and most of the people there were Blacks or... Yeah, most of them were Blacks. So, I mean, I&#39;ve always gotten along with Black people. I was always cool with the Black people that I met. But it kind of puts, like I said, a label on you because you&#39;re representing this clique and you are a different part of... basically you&#39;re just a completely different part of them. So once I got into juvie, I was able to understand that, I mean, it&#39;s not how they tell you it is in the streets, because the streets is like, &quot;Oh, Black people hate Mexicans, Black people hate White, Black people...&quot; and the other way around, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s maybe a way that I answer and I was like, &quot;Damn, what&#39;s going to happen. I don&#39;t see a lot of Mexicans here.&quot; But then the people that I was representing or that I was throwing... yeah, I was representing, I guess, never came up and saw like, &quot;Look at me. Hey, what&#39;s up, what are you doing? I never said nothing.&quot; And I was just all crewed up in there. And, I mean, my friends were actually Black in there. So I started talking more to Black people, and Black people were cool with me. So then more people of my gang started falling there, young people too. And they started seeing that I start talking to these people, and I started getting in trouble with my own gang.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then it&#39;s like, &quot;Why are you doing this? Why are you doing that when you know you&#39;re not supposed to be doing this.&quot; &quot;Yeah, but we&#39;re not out there no more.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;We&#39;re in here, it&#39;s completely different. You got to do anything to survive and you just can&#39;t be like fooling around.&quot; And I mean, I had to find my own people, I had to... Black people stood up for me. And, I mean, it was a crazy experience, but that&#39;s something that I feel like really shaped my... I just became a better person whenever I came out of there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so tell me about coming back to Mexico, how was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, coming back to Mexico was really rough too because, like I mentioned, I was just left in the border, and go back I had to find a way to... I mean, luckily I have family members in the border, so some of my cousin picked me up and he bought a plane ticket so I can come back to Mexico City because most of my family&#39;s here, and my mom wanted me to come to Mexico City and not stay at the border. So I came back to Mexico City, I was trying to study, it was kind of messed up because obviously I was seeing in another way. I just didn&#39;t fit there, the way I dress, the way I talk, the way I drive myself, it was completely different from the way they do it here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I experienced a lot of discrimination when I got here, and as I tried to study, they revaliated on my studies so I had to go one year back into high school. So I go to high school and the second day that I was in high school, I fight this guy because he didn&#39;t like me because the way I was and the way I looked. So he was like, &quot;Nah.&quot; He used to call me Cholo because I used to have that experience of... I mean, that appearance, all bolded, sagging my pants and Dickies and... It was just a different lifestyle, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So everybody was like, &quot;I know you&#39;re not from here. Where are you from?&quot; And they were trying to check me. And at the end of the day, if streets shows you something, I guess it&#39;s just to not let nobody talk over you or nobody put you down. So I fighted this guy, I started feeling a lot of pressure in school, people didn&#39;t like me, I would always be alone in lunch time. I mean, when it was recess and things like that, I was always alone. And people would look at me like if I was a bad person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then I started having problems with my own teachers, and mostly my English teacher, because she would get mad because I would correct her. I would tell her, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re wrong,&quot; or... Most of the teachers here in Mexico City don&#39;t know English. And it&#39;s crazy because they are teaching it. So that&#39;s the craziest thing about it. But I was like, &quot;All right, so I&#39;m not going to say anything. Keep doing your thing and I&#39;m just going to be here.&quot; But things got... in my end, I feel like it really became tedious just to go to school. So, I just decided to quit school. My mom was pretty pissed at me because my mom was still in the United States, but she was coming back because of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she have residency?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or citizenship?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was coming and crossing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just came back, she basically deported herself. So, I mean, she had no reason to come back because she was working over there and stuff, but I mean, she&#39;s always been too close with me, and then she knows all the things that I had to go through in juvie and how close I was to actually hitting the feds. So, I mean, I guess she didn&#39;t feel like she had no reasons to be in the US no more, and she just decided to come back. So she came back after like five months, but I mean, honestly I was into depression big time because I was just going through all these things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mind was telling me, &quot;You got to go back, you got to do this. You&#39;re not from here.&quot; But then again, you&#39;re not from over there. So you don&#39;t have a green card to be like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to go back.&quot; Or, &quot;I just can&#39;t cross the border.&quot; Because I knew if I would do that, that would automatically give me five years or ten years in the feds. So it was like, &quot;Do I really want to risk that? Do I really want to be free here or do I want to be locked up over there? Or do I deal with the people here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at the beginning, the same thing, when people started knowing me, and around the places where I lived, people would be like, &quot;Nah, you feel like you&#39;re better than us because you&#39;re coming from the US. But here you ain&rsquo;t shit,&quot; things like that, right? And like I mentioned, I&#39;ve never really let nobody talk nothing bad to me. So I would lash out, admittedly snap, and get in a fight with these people and be like, &quot;Damn it. Why am I really doing all of this? Why am I really going through all of this when this is supposed to be my city or where I was born?&quot; But I mean, discrimination, I had a lot when I got here. But I mean, it&#39;s something that you just got to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, what was the hardest part about being back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess that, discrimination. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is your mom still here with you or did she go back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she&#39;s in Mexico City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you still have family in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how does it feel to be separated from them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess that it&#39;s not really about my family, it&rsquo;s just a different lifestyle. It&#39;s just the way that I used to live over there and now I&#39;m here. And here it&rsquo;s like you got to struggle, it&rsquo;s a lot of struggle too, because maybe over there I was doing bad things but I had a good life. I always had money and things like that. My only family for me, it&#39;s always been my mom. So I can&#39;t really say I feel separated from none of my family because my dad is over there. My dad is over there, but I&#39;ve never lived with him. Like I mentioned since the beginning, he just decided to bounce on us and just do his own life and... So for me, I&#39;ve never really considered my dad to be that close to me. So it doesn&#39;t really bother me that he&#39;s over there and to see him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there is other things like not having a dad in your life and a man figure that could guide you and tell you that you&#39;re doing this wrong, you shouldn&#39;t be doing this. So that&#39;s also the reason why I feel like I messed up so much because my mom was always working, trying to give me something, and I didn&#39;t appreciate all the efforts that she was doing, and I just started doing the bad things. Why? Because, first of all, I kind of liked it, and second of all, because there was nobody to guide me like that. I was always alone. So I had&mdash;it&#39;s like I would ditch school, I would do bad things in school, and my mom would never find out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for me, like I said, my actual family is my mom and I was really grateful when I saw her again. But, I mean, like I mentioned, like a whole year, I was into depression, hanging out with the wrong people here again, doing bad things again, bad substances that I was getting into my body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that depression, at the end of the day, you find a way to cure it. You find a way how to relieve all this depression and all this bad things that you feel upon you. So that&#39;s a way to maybe just forget it. Maybe not even forget it, but at that, whenever I would be doing something, I would just forget about that at that time, right? Because when I was over it, it was like, &quot;Damn it.&quot; And that got me hooked into a lot of bad habits that later on in my life, it was hard for me to leave. But luckily, I mean, I was able to move on, I was able to leave a lot of things and I found this girl that right now I live with her, she&#39;s my partner. My wishes right now is to get married with her, because she really helped me. She really helped me to get out of bad environment again and helped me to stop doing the things that I was doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how have Hola Code been to you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Hola Code has been a life-changing experience. I mean, I definitely definitely never never never would have imagined I was going to study something where I was going to do something with my life. Ever since I came back, I was working in call centers. I mean, I started working in construction with a minimum wage of like 1200 pesos, which is nothing, like it literally ain&rsquo;t nothing. And then I started working in a factory, and then this factory, I mean, I was getting a little bit more money, but it wasn&#39;t really a lot, but I learned how to live with it, because at the end of the day you get used to whatever, like the environment, right? So whatever I was getting, I was like, &quot;Okay, I can live with this.&quot; But obviously I wasn&#39;t stable economically. Economically I didn&rsquo;t feel stable. Where I didn&#39;t feel like I had the same lifestyle that I had like when I was in the United States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then I started finding out about call centers and things like that. Those were the things that I guess helped me to make a little bit more of money to be more stable. And I mean, right now Hola Code, the fact that they are giving us this... that we&#39;re learning how to code and become a software engineer, it&#39;s something that I would have never thought of, and probably not even in the States, because even if I was arrested in the United States, I feel like I would be either dead or in jail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So most of my family is Christian, so I&#39;ve always said that God has always a plan for you. And maybe he puts you in tough situations, but he&#39;s always gonna get you out and put you in a better place. And that&#39;s how I feel right now, because after four years of being in Mexico City, I&#39;ve been through it all. Literally I&#39;ve done so many bad things here in Mexico City too. I&#39;ve been in bad habits, but I&#39;ve also been able to overcome all of that and just become a better me. And me, personally, I just feel like I&#39;ve grown so much these last couple of seven, eight months, I&#39;d say, ever since I started applying to Hola Code, because it&#39;s just shaped me a different way. And not just like then maybe I&#39;m going to be able to get a better job, but mentally, I feel like I&#39;m a better person. I don&#39;t want to do bad things no more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really focused on myself, my girlfriend, and getting the job right now because we&#39;re about to graduate. I&#39;m really focused on doing that. I&#39;m really focused on getting a job and maybe not staying in Mexico City or just go to Guadalajara or something like that, just move and start life again from zeros. And I know at some point I&#39;m going to be good, and I know that I&#39;m going to get a good job and I&#39;m going to be able to look over for my mom, my little sister. My little sister was born over there too, so she came with my mom. And ultimately that&#39;s my goal right now, to be able to provide for all my family and be able to... how can I say, to be able to look back whenever I&#39;m in that position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I feel like I&#39;m in a good position, I&#39;ve always said, and even right now, I just look back into my life and I&#39;m always like, &quot;Damn, I&#39;ve grown so much, I&#39;ve overcome so many things.&quot; And I&#39;ve gone through so many things that at the end of the day, like I mentioned, that has shaped me into being a better person now. And not really wanting to go back to those negative things because negative things always get you in trouble and get you into a bad place where, like I mentioned, either you&#39;re in jail or dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess that when I first got here, I felt like I was... not American, but a Pocho, Chicano, because I have a different culture. But other than that, I&#39;m Mexican all the way. And I&#39;m proud of being Mexican but it&#39;s just that I have a different culture with me. I have different views, I have different beliefs that maybe Mexicans don&#39;t have&mdash;like Mexicans all the way&mdash;because, I mean, Mexico has a lot of problems too and economically they&#39;re not the greatest. I mean, there&#39;s a lot of poverty over here, and a lot of people is poor. So I guess my... not advantage or the thing that I can say that I feel proud of, is just being able to be bicultural, and being able to say that I have another culture and I have different beliefs that have also taught me better than here. Because, yeah, I mean, sometimes the beliefs in Mexico City aren&#39;t the greatest either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And if you could have stayed in the US, what do you think you might have done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, I&#39;d probably be dead or in jail. So I&#39;m grateful because I&#39;m back here. I&#39;m grateful because I understood. Whenever I went to juvie, I understood that I was doing the things wrong and maybe I understood it when I was in there, and I mean, I&#39;m pretty sure everybody that&#39;s in prison going to tell you that, that when you&#39;re in prison you kind of start noticing all the things that you were doing and why you&#39;re in there. But when I got back here, depression was so bad that I started doing the same things. And then you really need somebody to actually help you to get out of all of that bad habits and bad things that you usually do, because if it wasn&#39;t for my girl, like I said, I don&#39;t know where I&#39;d be right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I probably would have never even signed up for this program. But the only reason why I want to be a better person is because of her. Cause she&#39;s helped me and she&#39;s given me so much that I just want to pay it back. I know, it&#39;s not like I feel I&#39;m in debt with her, but that&#39;s just my desire. That&#39;s just my desire to say, &quot;You know what? I can look up for you. I can look up for my mom. I can look up for my little sister.&quot; And just the fact that I can provide for them, that really gets me... that&#39;s what really motivates me to be able to find a good job and be able to support them as much as I can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the next four or three questions are more like reflective, but what can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well in my point of view, I feel like maybe they can help us with some Spanish lessons cause, I mean, at the beginning when I got here, my Spanish was so bad and I couldn&#39;t even communicate with people right. And people would look at me and it&#39;s like, you could see any American here trying to speak Spanish. And they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, he&#39;s like a gabacho,&quot; right? So, they just laugh and try to help you with whatever you want. But they see you and you&#39;re like, &quot;You&rsquo;re no American, you&#39;re Mexican. Why are you faking it?&quot; Or, &quot;Why are you trying to speak that way?&quot; But they don&#39;t really understand that we have a different culture and at the end of the day, we kinda forget about Spanish because we don&#39;t really use it over there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, maybe with your family, maybe you throw a joke or you hear a joke that your uncle is going to crack or something, right? But it&#39;s like, for you to actually speak Spanish with your friends or something like that or in school, not really. Everything is in English when you&#39;re in the US. So I feel like grammar for me it&#39;s a big problem because I have... My grammar is not that bad anymore, but it was really bad when I got here. I feel like also, maybe the government can implement something to help people integrate into school and to not feel like you are not the same as everybody there. Because you feel left out, you feel like you don&#39;t fit there. So when I first got to the US, I didn&#39;t know no English, right? I was five. I mean, I was pretty little, but I knew Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So something that really surprises me about the US is that, when I first started first grade, they would take me out of school and they would put me into the special class so I can actually catch up with the people there, because I didn&#39;t know no English. So I started from colors, to numbers, to letters, to little words, to things like that. And then to help me with my pronunciation and be like, &quot;You can. This is the way you say it.&quot; Things like that. So at the end of the day, I feel like Mexico should do something like that too, because people are just so used to speaking English, it&#39;s just like we sometimes do need help to catch up again in Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, maybe most of us, it&#39;s not our fault that we know other languages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And people here in Mexico see it like a bad thing because... Once I was in the Metro... I&#39;m gonna tell you a little story. I was riding the Metro and I was with another friend of mine, we were speaking between me and him. And then, this guy in the back starts talking all this crazy stuff, because we were speaking English. &quot;This is not America. [foreign language 00:34:34] &hellip;Ingl&eacute;s...&quot;. Things like that. So it was like, &quot;Where&#39;s that coming from? Why are you so... Where&#39;s your envy coming? Why are you so jealous?&quot; Or, &quot;What is it? What really is it, like... Are you jealous? Do you feel envy? Do you actually feel like I feel like I&#39;m better than you? What is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I mean, that little story didn&#39;t end up well, because we ended up fighting that guy with his friends, but it&#39;s because at the end of the day we have different beliefs. I mean, why does people get so bothered hearing other Mexicans speak English, right? I mean, so I feel that, that&#39;s maybe not from the government, but that&#39;s more cultural thing. And at the end of the day, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ever going to be able to fix that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, I mean, I&#39;m pretty sure you can ask anybody, any of the people that has been deported, if they ever encounter any type of problem, because they were speaking English in the streets or in the Metro or in a bus or something. And they&#39;re going to tell you, &quot;Yes, people was talking something in the back cause they didn&#39;t like it.&quot; But, I mean, like I mentioned, I guess that&#39;s something cultural, it&#39;s more cultural.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what do you think that the US government can do to help Mexican deportees and the families that they leave behind?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I definitely think that&#39;s really complicated because I don&#39;t think they can do anything. I mean, if they didn&#39;t do anything to maybe help us... Some people deserve to come back, ultimately, because maybe we messed up, and we&#39;re doing bad things. But I&#39;ve known people that was studying, that was doing the right thing, just because ICE pulled them over and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, you got no papers? You&#39;re going back.&quot; So I feel like they should be more conscious that a lot of people is not their decision to be there, it was the decision of their parents, and that at the end of the day, they&#39;re not doing nothing bad. They&#39;re trying... I think they&#39;re going to provide something to society if it&#39;s a good person, right? Like I mentioned, a lot of people, we made bad decisions and we messed up and maybe we deserve it, because we caused that. We caused for them to deport us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, I mean, there&#39;s so many people that should not be deported just because... So I feel like if the government did not do something to help them while they&#39;re over there, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to be able to do anything once we&#39;re over here. And, like I mentioned, if they didn&#39;t help the person that was getting deported, if it was something legit to be deported for or just because they wanted to, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to do anything, to be honest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my last question is, why do you think that young Mexican men in the US turn to crime and gangs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm. That&#39;s a tough one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess there&#39;s so many different scenarios because, me, it was my environment, the people that I started knowing and that I started hanging around with. And ultimately, I mean, it was also where I was raised, it&#39;s California, South California. I was in Santa Ana, I was also over here in Orange County, but then I was in San Diego too. So when you&#39;re brought up in those specific parts of the city, it&#39;s either you turn into what everybody is, or everybody&#39;s going to be picking on you. Everybody&#39;s going to try to get you. So sometimes people don&#39;t have a choice. And people start doing things so that people don&#39;t bother you, so that you can feel that you&#39;re cool. Why? Because maybe we have a bad culture too there to think that just because you got money, and you got a car, and you got this and that, I mean, you don&#39;t really care where it&#39;s coming from, where the source of all that kind of money is coming from. As long as you got it, you have it, and you&#39;re good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So some other people just decide to join because they want to be cool. Some other people do it because they got family members in the gangs and they&#39;re just following exactly, they just follow. But, I mean, sometimes it just the environment. I feel like there is no specific reason. There&#39;s so many ways you can fall into a gang or that the gang can actually put you, that the gang can actually... That you can end up in there, ultimately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So those were all the questions that I had. But now I want to give you a chance if there&#39;s anything else that you want to add, anything that you want to tell me, or you want me to know, or the people that are listening to this, whatever they do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I would say that, choose wisely because, like I mentioned, me I felt like I was a good kid, I was doing great in school at the beginning, but you sometimes feel like you want to be cool, you want to be part of that. You want to be part of the people that&rsquo;s over here laughing and be like, &quot;I want to be in there.&quot; So just choose wisely. I mean, don&#39;t mess up. Don&#39;t fall into gangs. I feel like that&#39;s the worst thing you can do because it&#39;s just going to ruin your life. Because like I mentioned, once you affiliate with a gang and you start doing bad things, there&#39;s only two outcomes, you go to jail or you&#39;re going to be dead. They&#39;re going to kill you in the streets because the streets are real and people that&#39;s running the streets are no joke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you are willing to follow that path, just be prepared for everything. Be prepared to fall into prison, be prepared to maybe get shot, get prepared to be stabbed, be prepared to be falling into all this crazy stuff. But also I would just say, don&#39;t ever underestimate yourself. Don&rsquo;t ever think that just because people seem that they&#39;re having fun and you feel like you&#39;re not, don&#39;t go for it. Stay on your lane, follow your own beliefs and follow whatever your parents taught you, because it&#39;s something that at the end of the day is going to help you. That would be it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess now that&rsquo;s everything that you&#39;ve told me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gerson:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be great.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c5 c7"><span class="c2"></span></p></div></body></html>
