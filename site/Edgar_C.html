c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So this is Anne, &nbsp;and I want to start by thanking you for coming to talk to us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re welcome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&#39;s important that people hear your story and the stories of people like you. So I know it could be painful, but ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not there for your survey, so I don&#39;t know much about your circumstances. So could you tell me about the circumstances of you and your family going to the United States? Why you went, how old you were, what it was like for you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I actually went to the United States in around &#39;92, and I didn&#39;t have no other option, my parents took me. So really I didn&#39;t have no option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was by about maybe 10, eight to 10 years old. So that&#39;s really the reason how I ended up over there. And I was over there for about 26 years. So I&#39;m recently back in Mexico City, been here for like 45 days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45 days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, ma&#39;am.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my. It must be a culture shock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is. It is &lsquo;cause you&#39;re used to something totally different to this, but, I guess you got to adapt to...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...whatever comes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were somewhere about eight or 10 years old?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes ma&#39;am.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you went with your parents. Why did they decide to come?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic problems. There was not enough jobs at that time, I guess. And for money situations. That&#39;s how they ended up over there. So we didn&#39;t really have a choice. Just had to go along with it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have siblings with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I got two brothers and two sisters and me were five in total. My oldest sisters, she&#39;s, she&#39;s already 30, 38. I got a 30 year old, and a 32 year old, and a 31 year old and a 30 year old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you all, you all went?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we all went in at the same time. We ended up over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it hard to leave other family members or friends behind when you left?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&#39;t really be sure and tell you that yeah, because I was really young, and I didn&#39;t really understand things. But not really. Once you get over there, you forget about all this, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember crossing the border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do. It was, actually, it was us five and my grandma came along with us, and we all went at the same time, and thank God we made it to, to our destination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you cross the border by car or by walking?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we crossed it in a float, like a tire float with a piece of wood inside of it. And they just drug us across the ... Because it was a lady with five children, so you know they were not going to throw us in the river like that. So they crossed us, and once we got there, we the hit the house we were going, and we ended up in Love Field Airport, Dallas, Texas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s where you stayed in Dallas?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s where I lived for 26 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was your father with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, my father had to stay &lsquo;cause him and my mom separated at that point. So really there was not ... There hasn&#39;t been no communication with our father since we left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was brave of her to take five children then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was. Well, she left first. She left like in &#39;91 and left us behind so she could make up some money to send come and get us. So after that, yeah. For the first time she did it. I guess it was kind of hard for her at first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the five of you and your mom and grandma set up a house in Dallas?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Dallas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did she work?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah yeah, she had two jobs. She worked for McDonald&#39;s and Jack in the Box, and she had two jobs. So she was busy, most of the day, once she got us in school, you know, then started getting situated. We started living in a one-bedroom apartment, and it was real tiny, but we had to deal with that for now, until she started working and getting more </span><span class="c3">moneys</span><span class="c0">. Then we moved to a two bedroom and we came up from there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. Did your grandma work too, or did she just-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my grandma, she took care of us. That&#39;s how she did took care of us. My mom was the one doing all the working. And then after years, my mom would send for her brothers, sisters, for her siblings and got them all over there. So pretty much all my family is over there. I only got one uncle that stays here, and that&#39;s where I&#39;m staying at right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, wow. So she was working, your grandmother was taking care of you. And you started going to school, I assume pretty quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes I did. I started ... I don&#39;t really remember if it was third or fourth grade, and ever since then, I&#39;ve went all the way to ninth grade in class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You went to ninth grade?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it hard learning the language?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, yeah. And the bullying, you know of you being a migrant and not knowing the language. It was pretty tough at first, but after a while, once you start getting used to the environment and you started learning, then you start fitting in and. But at first, yes, it&#39;s a challenge. And I believe that, that&#39;s anywhere you go where you&#39;re not used to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Were you the oldest of your-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I&#39;m the second oldest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re the second.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, ma&#39;am.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you have an older ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got an older sister.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister. Did you feel like she sort of took over some of the role of your mom or, since she was the oldest or the five of you? Or do you think that sister grandma was around ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, well really it was most of the time, it was my grandma. So really my sister only did what was left, but most of the time it was my grandma, and my grandma let her be a child that she was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good, that&rsquo;s good. So what was family life like in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, it was great. It was great, yes. Since we were kids, my mom always took care of us, always tried to teach us the good things. And at times you know, it was hard, but we had fun. She took us to a lot of places. She used to take us every year to Galveston over there in Houston, by Houston. So we did, you know, have fun. It was a lot of good memories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good. And you had four, four siblings to have fun with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said, how long do you think it took before you fit in at school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe about a year, a year or so. Yeah. Like I said, it&#39;s hard at first, but once you start fitting in and you start trying, you know, trying to learn the language, then you get to start talking to some other people, different races, you know. Where I was raised, I was raised in a neighborhood where there was Vietnamese, and Mexicans and Cubans. So it was a really, really weird environment cause three different nationalities and ... But at the end, it ended up being all right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diverse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, diverse, yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you had lots of friends?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did. I do have a lot of them over there. Not here, but over there, yeah, I do have a lot of friends</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you like school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. I did. But like I said, you, once you start coming out of your shell, when you&#39;re in a group of ... Whatever environment you&#39;re in, then you start you know, slacking, what we call as s</span><span class="c3">la</span><span class="c0">cking, going the different direction, you know. But yeah, I did like school. I was a really wild kid at that point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were wild?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but once I started like middle school, and I guess that&#39;s an every day, every teenager, you know. But that&#39;s how I ended up not finishing my school. Started having kids early age. So I had to work now, you know, put food on the table and stuff like that. But yeah, I did like school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you play sports?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did, I played soccer in middle school and football. I did it for two years, the two years that I was in middle school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was fun?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you said you quit after ninth grade because you felt that you needed to-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide for my kids. Because I started having kids at 16, like around 15, going on 16. I had my first daughter in &#39;99, and then I had a son in 2001, and then I had a daughter in 2002.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you with the same woman?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. She&#39;s actually American white, so they&#39;re mixed white and Mexican. So yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old was she?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was like 14 at that time. So that was another thing too. You know, having to, we&#39;re young, we don&#39;t comprehend very well, but then we started having kids. So now you got to work and all this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get your own apartment?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I did have my own apartment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you were like 16?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like 15, my mom ran and got us an apartment so, but we were paying the rent so. Because we couldn&#39;t get an apartment, we were too young, you know. But yeah, every since then-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you do to work?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did flooring, I know how to do flooring, remodeling. I did all types of flooring: carpet, vinyl, VCT-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardwood?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardwood. Everything that had to do with flooring, I did it. And I know a little bit of carpentry, a little bit of everything. So that&#39;s what I did for about 15 to 18 years. I did remodeling, yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your whole time in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you work for a company or did you work for yourself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked for several companies, but I did. Like I said, I was a subcontractor, so I had to go get these contracts with all these different companies. So every day I had a job, either with this company, or this company, or this company, but it was going pretty good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how does that work with given that you were undocumented? Did you have an employee ID number?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, it&rsquo;s called a, yeah it&#39;s called the tax ID.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the tax ID.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whenever you go get a tax ID and then they put it in the system somehow. It becomes like a social security, because you&#39;re claiming taxes. But most of my contracts, I did them under my wife&#39;s name because she was legal. And at the end, she could claim our kids, and instead of me paying, they had, we had to get reimbursed. So most of the time I did it through her, maybe a few times at the beginning when, when I started off, yeah, I applied by myself. But it works with fake documents or just a tax ID.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you stay with her all that time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was with her for like about 18 years. I got, my daughter right now, she&#39;s going to be 20. I got a granddaughter, she&#39;s one year old right now. I got my son, he&#39;s 17, he&#39;s about to turn 18 and he gots two little girls ... One little girl and one little boy. He was just born like two weeks ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they&#39;re not twins. They&#39;re separate... different moms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the latest one that he had, he was two years old. Yeah, but he works, I mean, and he just graduated from school, so-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were with your wife until a year or two before you came back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, a year or two before I came back. I was actually sent back, but yeah, I was with her for about 18 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still in contact with her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I talk to her every day. This is the mother of my kids.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how old are the kids now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19, 17 and 16. My daughter actually she&#39;s right now, she&#39;s in Baltimore. She&#39;s in the school that they ... It&#39;s like camp and they take her to these camps. It&#39;s like a Catholic school type stuff. So she&#39;s over there in Baltimore right now with the youngest one, she&#39;s 16. But them other two are in Dallas, they work, they got their own little families. So they&#39;re doing pretty good, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. That&#39;s great. &nbsp;And you were in contact with them until you got sent back here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I call them every day right now. Yeah, every day I call them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I talk to them. But yeah, I&#39;m in contact with them every day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good, that&#39;s good. What do you, what do you remember most fondly about growing up in the US? What was your favorite thing about that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The childhood when we used to come out at night and we all had bikes, you know. And going around with kids in the bikes. You know, most of my childhood was really fun. We had a big group of kids, cause where we stayed, like I said, it was different races, and we had a big group. So we had pretty fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Sounds fun to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t see that here as much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Right here is like a New York, but in a Mexican way. Every day there&#39;s movement. All day movement and never stops, never stops.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must&#39;ve been hard being you know, a 15, 16 year old kid, you got to get your own apartment, you go to work, you got a baby. I assume your, the mom who was still a kid, she stayed home with the child.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she did. At first, like the first two, maybe two years, it was easy because her mom helped us a lot. So, so it was pretty easy, but they can&#39;t be there forever. So, so once she stopped, like not, not in a mean way, but letting her take control over her responsibility, then we started getting more challenging, but, we overcame it and we came out pretty good. I mean, I can&#39;t complain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get in trouble?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. I did it a lot. Like I said, since I started growing up and started hanging around with the wrong folks, but at the end, like, I started losing ... Once my daughter was born, I stopped, like stepping away from everything, but it&#39;s never ... If you&#39;re in the environment, in the circle, you&#39;re going to maintain in the circle. So if you don&#39;t move around and find somewhere else to go, then you&#39;re never going to change, or you&#39;re never going to be the same. So that&#39;s what maintained me. I started moving away and started getting away from the trouble, but I did get in a lot of trouble when I was a young kid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you part of a gang?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was. I did hang around with a few of them, but never actually wanted to be in a gang for the simple reasons that, I mean, I didn&#39;t see no point of it, you know. But yeah, I affiliated with a lot of them, but I wasn&#39;t in it, but I knew a lot of them. But never wanted to become one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;re saying that to get out of trouble, you started moving a little bit farther away from-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farther away, because that&#39;s when the change comes. When, if you&#39;re in the same environment every day, and even though you go away and you come back, that the neighborhood ain&#39;t change. So you&#39;re still going to see the same thing over and over, and it&#39;s a cycle. It&#39;s never going to stop. The only, the only way that it could stop, is if you get out that cycle and walk away and go somewhere else. That&#39;s, that&rsquo;s what I believe. I don&#39;t know, may be right, may be wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So it sounds like you developed a pretty good career in flooring as a subcontractor with different companies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes I did. It was pretty good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, did you have workers working with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. At one point, I had three people. There was times that there was jobs, there was times that we didn&#39;t have enough, and I just ended up on my own for the same reason that I didn&#39;t want them to have people working for me. And I couldn&#39;t pay them because the company, you know ... I still had to be responsible. So now I&#39;m stuck with this situation, you know. But at the end, it was all right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you said you moved around. Did you get, you know, the standard of living for your kids, did it go up as you got more accomplished in your career?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, kind of. Yeah, but, it&#39;s hard where you grow up, and then it&rsquo;s also, hard switching to a whole different lifestyle, or what you&#39;re used to, you know. But yeah, we worked at it after all. Moving away from, from bad influence and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you stayed around Dallas area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I stayed in Dallas. Yeah, just in a different county, in a different neighborhood, you know. But I stayed over there most of my time. I did go out to like Houston, Oklahoma, [inaudible 00:21:04] coast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do jobs?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, to do jobs. But most of my time, I spent, I spent it in Dallas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to ask you something. Let me just remember what I was going to ask you about. Oh, driving. How did you get around that? Did you get a fake license, or just no license?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, actually I only, I only had gotten maybe a few parking, a few tickets, traffic tickets. So really, I would just drive with no license. I did have carry an insurance because it was under my mom&#39;s name, but never carry a license or an ID cause really I never needed it, you know. But got away for all that time that I ... I drove around a lot and.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagine you had to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So thank God man, I never got pulled over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know when you were a kid in school that you were undocumented and that it would be tough for you, like driving, work permits or things like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&#39;re a kid, you don&#39;t really think about all that, because nobody brings it up to your attention. So you&#39;re really just focusing on growing up and living the lifestyle that you live in the US. But really never crossed my mind about being an issue or bringing me problems, for me. Never thought about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what were your dreams while you were in the US? What were your dreams?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well to open a little shop, flooring shop, or a little like an entrepreneur remodeling business and stuff like that. But never came true, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you close?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was really close, but you also had to do a lot, not only because of being illegal or anything, but the situation with my wife and stuff like that, you know. So that had, that had a lot to do with me not accomplishing what my goal was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things started</span><span class="c3">...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, start twisting out. Yeah. But I lived a pretty, pretty amazing American dream you could say. It was really fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. What caused you to come back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little situation that I had in &nbsp;2000</span><span class="c3">...</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;2006, and it got me into trouble with the law. So I did, I did, five years in the state penitentiary. So that&#39;s how I ended up over here over some, something that you could say, &quot;Oh man, it was stupid.&quot; But sometimes you </span><span class="c3">gotta pay</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the consequences of your actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was 2006 you committed a crime?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I got, and I got, arrested in 2014, and I did five years after, after I went to the trial or whatever. Then I ended up being guilty. They gave me five years. I did it in TDC, and then I got sent over here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as soon as you were finished with your time-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My time, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICE-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ICE got a hold of me and then brought me over here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did it take so long between 2011 when you ... Did you say in 2011 you-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2006.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2006 and then 2014?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, the, the situation where I was in, it was me and some other girl. And I just opened a car, but I didn&#39;t mean to ... We didn&#39;t break into it, we didn&#39;t mess nothing up. And like I said, when you&#39;re young, you do stupid things. So I opened the, the door, the owner of the truck is behind in the back of the truck. So he comes around and grabs me, gets a hold of me. The girl puts a BB gun that don&#39;t work, don&#39;t have nothing in it, just an old BB gun, rusted BB gun. And she puts it out to their man. The man lets me go, I jump in the car, we take off. So this happened in 2006. So I started living my life like normal, because I never thought nothing of it. So I lived my life normal all the way up to 2014.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s like a carjacking?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was not a carjacking because we weren&#39;t trying to jack the car. Like I said, I told the girl that ... I told her something, I leaned against the door. And when I opened it, like I said, the owner of the truck was in the back. So the owner of t</span><span class="c3">he truck</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;thought we were trying to get in the car, but we never got arrested. I didn&#39;t get arrested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ran away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I just ran away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you didn&#39;t take the car or anything?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, nothing, just her car and we ran away in her car. So days later, I guess she got arrested or whatever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a friend of yours?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well she was, but she wasn&#39;t. And she left and she live her own life. I started living my own life and we stop having contact with each other. So then later on in 2014, they told me I got a warrant for my arrest. I get pulled over for a traffic stop. And they asked me for my driver&#39;s license. I told them I didn&#39;t have one. I gave them my name. They told me that I had a warrant for my arrest since 2006. And I put two to two together. And then I went to court and they found me guilty and they gave me a five years state.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what did they say your crime was?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggravated robbery. But the only reason they didn&#39;t give me more time is because they knew that I wasn&#39;t the one that pulled the gun and they knew that it was a fake gun. But the state of Texas had to prosecute you, even though you didn&#39;t steal nothing or didn&#39;t rob anything. You opened his truck and in this truck-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a weapon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and you have a weapon that he don&#39;t know that it&#39;s a fake gun, or you know... So he fears for his life. So they gave me, they gave me five years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about the girl?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl, I never knew about the girl anymore. But in court when they presented me all my documents, they gave me all this paperwork. It&#39;s called, its a ... I forgot what the affidavit, what it&#39;s called, but they gave me all, all my, the evidence that they had against me. So they gave it to me. And that girl had said that I had threatened her, that if she didn&#39;t take the whole fall for it, that I was going to hurt her and her family and all this. So that&#39;s why they that&#39;s how that girl came in play. But really, I never seen the girl again or anything, you know. But yeah, that&#39;s another part of this story. And I got deported. I got out in April, April 3rd, 2019, and I got sent to Mexico and I got here to Mexico City on the 7th of April. So I&#39;ve been here, like I said, probably about 45 days, maybe two months already.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you had this charge against you, thought you were living your life and suddenly ... Did you get a lawyer?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I did. That&#39;s how I got my sentence reduced because they were really offering me a five to nine, nine years. So that&#39;s how I ended up getting the minimum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you committed crimes earlier? Did you have a record before that, or no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well yeah, but like minor things, like running away from the law, like evading arrest or tickets. Like I said, I had very few tickets. The ones that I had, I had to do them in the County, but other than that, I was just, just good. But I guess things happen for a reason, you know. So that&#39;s how I look at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you said immediately ICE came. Did you fight it or did you just sign voluntary departure?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I just signed voluntary ... Yeah, because then you end up being locked up for another who knows?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;d had enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So I just want to be free.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re here now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&#39;m here now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;re living with an uncle?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my uncle and my aunt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they live here in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they live in Mexico City, about 30 or 45 minutes away from here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how&#39;s that going?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s going all right. I got a job, actually. I work for a company that delivers material for Home Depot, so but the pay is not, not great. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m right here looking for a job where I could make more money. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So delivery for homes. So do you drive a truck or something?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I just, I just riding along with the-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift, yeah there&#39;s no forklifts here or ... Here&#39;s a forklift. I asked that guy, man. Say, &quot;Man, are they going to send any forklifts or anything?&quot; He said, &quot;No, you&#39;re just going to get in the back and you&#39;re going to throw them to me, and then I&#39;m just going to carry it.&quot; I&#39;m thinking, &quot;Man.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it doesn&#39;t really use your English skills, this stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t, yes. It really don&#39;t. So I want something that, that could bring me a little bit of money and probably use my English skills, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it seems like that it&#39;s more marketable, the English skills. So now you&#39;re back. Like what are, what are your dreams now? Or do you have any? Have you made new ones, or are you still thinking on it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now I&#39;m focusing on ... I&#39;m trying to get a better job and getting stable first. But yeah, if I don&#39;t happen to go back or anything, I would like to open ... Open a little they don&#39;t have it much around here, but like a barbecue pit, a Dickey&rsquo;s style type of stuff or something like that, that has to do with barbecue ribs, roast beef, roast beef sandwiches and stuff like that. You don&#39;t hardly see it here that much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So bringing a little of Texas here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texas to the city. And maybe work on that and get a little spot and open a little, like a little kind of a bar, but not a bar, but you know. Somewhere where people can enjoy their moments. That&#39;s where I&#39;m focusing on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old are you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m 36.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re young.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You started those children early.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real early. Really early.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re young. You&#39;ve got a lot ahead of you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re really focusing on making something of yourself here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes. I think there is opportunity here, and that it&#39;s probably not be the same as the US, but it&#39;s a little bit close to it. So I think if you could accomplish something over there, you could accomplish something over here, as long as you work hard and.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to say, if I were to ask you, do you think of yourself as a Mexican, an American, something different? What would you say?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m a Mexican, but with a little bit of American in me, you could say. But I got to be honest, I am a Mexican. I feel Mexican. Now that I&#39;m over here, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These last 45 days </span><span class="c3">have they been </span><span class="c0">tough?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really tough. Emotionally and there&#39;s been a stressful situation, economic way, that situation. Yeah. It gets critical at times, because of the job that I got and being out for only so long and still feel pressure. So but yeah, it&#39;s been tough, really tough. Family, kids, grandson born and can&#39;t have those moments. But other than that, I&#39;m coming along pretty good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it better than prison?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Way better, way better. Yeah, that&#39;s one thing that at least I&#39;m free, you know. At least I&#39;m free. But yeah, it is kind of stressful. New culture, different environment. Not what we used to over there, you know. Walking a lot. Right here, it&#39;s a lot of walking. I walk so much in this last few months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ll be in good shape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I lost about, about 35 pounds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you&#39;ve been here? That&#39;s crazy. You showing pictures to your kids?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New man here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was 180 and now I&#39;m like 150, 155.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the last, last 60 days, I lost pretty much a lot of weight. My job and -</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and you&#39;re the forklift.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c4">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[laughs</span><span class="c3">] </span><span class="c0">Yeah, and just walking around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So we&#39;re sort of at the end of the interview, but I&#39;m just going to let you ... If there&#39;s anything you want to share about your experiences, you as a migrant. What people should think about when they think about you or migrants in general. Is there anything you want to say?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah, sometimes people look at us like when we get here, but it&#39;s because we&#39;ve been used to a whole different lifestyle. Everything is like a piece of cake given to you in the US. And you come over here and you try to share those experiences. People look at you different, or they think that you&#39;re stuck up, or that you think that you feel better than them just because you know a different language. But we really don&#39;t. We&#39;re &nbsp;really just as Mexican as everybody is here, we just come from a different environment and different experiences. And we&#39;re not as stuck up and. But yeah, I would like to tell them people, man, that we&#39;re normal like anybody else, you know. That&#39;s about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s been hard making friends?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it is, especially one, because I&#39;m not used to talking to people. I&#39;m not, I&rsquo;m not, an antisocial, but I like to stay away from certain people for the experiences that I have passed through, and I try to avoid. But I will talk to people, &quot;Hi, how are you doing?&quot; They talk to me, fine. If they don&#39;t, fine too. But yeah, it is challenging being over here and coming from a different, whole different place. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, best of luck to you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Edgar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c17"><td class="c14" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p></td><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c18"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c8"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p></div></body></html>
