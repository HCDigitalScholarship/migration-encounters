And I understand that sometimes talking about these stories can be a little difficult because they bring about emotions and things that you don&#39;t want to go through again or relive. But I think it&#39;s good to note how important your story is and how important it&#39;s going to be for people to hear it and to understand the realities of migration and also the human side of migration. So thank you very much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you&#39;re welcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do want to say that I may be taking some notes along the way if that&#39;s okay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah. So my first question is why did you leave Mexico and who with?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By myself, and it was because what happened where I lived, it was a lot of crime</span><span>...</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;that&#39;s why. I&#39;ve never been </span><span>gang-related</span><span class="c1">, nothing like that. Never like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what type of crime would happen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just drugs and things like that, and a lot of violence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it organized criminals or cartels that ran?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a little bit of everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Well, I remember when I arrived there, it was on... I depart Mexico on August the 16th and it took me... 10 days to cross the border and then I got there on August the 29th, on </span><span>Arizona</span><span class="c1">. That was my first day there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what did you do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing. I just took a shower and eat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you eat, do you remember?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a burrito.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what did you do in the United States? What was your life like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was trying to work, but my brother, he decided not to. He&#39;s the one that put me in school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you went to school? Yes?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah with</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you remember any teachers or friends?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I remember Mrs. </span><span>_____</span><span class="c2">, she was a really nice teacher. She used to speak Spanish. I went to the </span><span>_____</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;High School in 2006 to 2008. And yeah, it was really nice. I had a really nice time there, they were really great. They was helping the Spanish people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome</span><span>.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span>A</span><span class="c1">nd so tell me about your job, your work, your life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to do a little bit of everything, what I wanted to be was... I tried to play professional soccer, but I never had the money or the [inaudible 00:03:17]. So I started school, I started playing soccer. I was good at it and then what happened is that I moved to a different county. And that was when it was over with. But then after that I started working, a little bit of everything, restaurants, waitress, carwash, and things like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you like about soccer?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything. Yeah, since I was a little kid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your favorite team?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Mexico is America and from Europe is Barcelona.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so how long did you play soccer for, until...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I played soccer for, I think it was a season and a half. What happened was that I got a little injured, my leg. And then I stopped playing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was there a lot of gang affiliations and stuff in the county that you lived in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it&#39;s everywhere, but I was never involved </span><span>to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why</span><span>... </span><span class="c1">how did you end up in prison?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. What happened is that I was with some friends, we were in the streets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were you doing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were just hanging out, like </span><span>walk out</span><span class="c1">, things like that. But, there was people that were doing other stuff. So I got involved and that&#39;s the reason I got arrested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of stuff?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just stupid stuff, like just</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">chillin&rsquo;, [inaudible], </span><span>doing </span><span class="c2">like... going to a, what you call? Just </span><span>kid </span><span class="c1">places, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how did they get you then? You just got picked up one day?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I just got picked up. We were doing just stupid stuff and then I got caught off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like drugs, alcohol?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no. It was other stuff. Yeah. So yeah, they pulled me over and as a result I ended up in the county.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how did you end up back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico, that was because... For that, that&#39;s how everything started, they did a follow-up. So when I did time in the county, they dropped, supposedly, the felony. They dropped it to a misdemeanor. And then when I went, they took me to immigration so that&#39;s where they hold me. They released me, they gave me a chance to stay in the States, but they got me for no driver&#39;s license, two times, three times total. So, and then</span><span>...</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;they keep you like that for two years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I applied for DACA. I did a follow-up, but I don&#39;t know what happened to be honest. The only thing that I wanted to be was to be over with. I just want to be free, I don&#39;t want to be... People follow me or, because I used to take daily appointments, once a week to immigration. I need to go over there and sign up, they talk to me and things like that. And they got me with a little bracelet on the leg so they know where I am, what I&#39;m doing and all that stuff. So it was kind of aggravating and frustrating at the same time because I was feeling like a little dog, like an animal. I understand that we make mistakes and that&#39;s the way we learn. But that&#39;s no way to treat people like that, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why did they give you the chance to stay in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I went to school and they told me to get a lawyer. I get a lawyer, the lawyer didn&#39;t do nothing, at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Wow. So you kept continuing on in that process for two years, but you still were able to apply for DACA and all that, and you were on your path to get residency?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>I was about to get t</span><span class="c1">he DACA, the permission to be there, to study, to work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you said that you later applied for political asylum?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I did. Because what happened was I had no choice. I didn&#39;t know what to do. So they give me the </span><span>voluntary</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;departure. But if I do that, I have no one to help me out because what happened is that I have my </span><span>buddies</span><span class="c1">, you know they come here with the money? So no one... Besides that, I didn&#39;t want to get involved with no one, I didn&#39;t want to affect no one. So that&#39;s the reason that I did the political asylum, but that&#39;s the reason that I got deported, for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got it, because you didn&#39;t get approved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t, right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand. How was it like coming back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s different. The weather, the atmosphere, it&#39;s really heavy. But it&#39;s okay, I raised here, so it&#39;s no big deal. One of the good things about me is that I get adapted real quick, anywhere. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s cold, if it&#39;s hot, I get adapted easily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was the return difficult?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really because everything</span><span>... </span><span class="c1">my entire family is here. My mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Tell me about that. You left, how was it leaving your family and then coming back all those years later?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, it wasn&#39;t difficult to be honest. Because I&#39;m those type of people that when I decide something I go for it. It doesn&#39;t matter what I had to leave behind. If I want that, that&#39;s what I do. So, I&#39;m not, </span><span>like,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;lonely person, but the type of the situation, I just always decide for myself. It is difficult, you&#39;ve left your family, your dad, it was kind of difficult because my dad passed away. My brother got killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother got killed by I don&#39;t know who. My dad just died. So those are the things that&#39;s kind of difficult still because I&#39;m never going to get the chance to see them. The last time I saw them it was 2006, it was in August. That was the last time I saw their face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So you said something about maybe getting some help from an organization here, but then not...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c2">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an organization about immigration, they welcome the immigrant. They call it </span><span>&lsquo;Repatriados&rsquo; [Returnees]</span><span class="c2">, something like that. So they were helping, they were giving me like a 2,265 Pesos a month, for six months</span><span>, t</span><span class="c2">hey were helping me out with that</span><span>. They</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;were about to help me with 25,000 Pesos, when I open my own business, but that&#39;s the part I didn&#39;t get. That they didn&#39;t follow up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you like to open your own business?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, to be honest. Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you like it to be?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to create things, I like to do tile, so I will open a tile business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been discriminated here in Mexico for being a return migrant?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, never.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United States is not just America, we&#39;re all American. But for country, I feel Mexican.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m from Puerto Rico, I totally understand that. If you could have stayed in the United States, what do you think you would have done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do better, to be honest. Do better and grow up and mature because in Mexico it&#39;s hard, to get a job, to get money. Everything&#39;s really expensive. If I would&#39;ve stayed there, I would do better, I would have start saving money, sending money back to Mexico, helping my family, my brothers and sisters, something that I didn&#39;t...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that you didn&#39;t do better?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. When you&#39;re a kid, when you&#39;re young you think you have everything in your hands, but you never know that you can lose everything on a blink of an eye. One mistake can take everything away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what do you think you&#39;d like to do now that you&#39;re back in Mexico, what are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now I just want to focus on my family. My little girl, my little boy, my wife and if I get the chance to help my family, I will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why, I&#39;m going to ask you, these are my last few questions. They&#39;re more reflection based, but what can the Mexican government do to support Mexican men and Mexican returnees so that they don&#39;t turn to crime when they come back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, that depends on everyone, because there&#39;s choices. You decide to be whatever you want to be, so even the government do something about it, if you don&#39;t want it, if you don&#39;t like it, you won&#39;t do it. So that&#39;s depending on self, on yourself than anyone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is there anything that the government can do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe they do good. They&#39;re receiving the immigrants back, helping them out with money, food, shelter and things like that. That&#39;s really good. But what they have to do is just make everything better, just don&#39;t leave it halfway. Like schools, they have really big needs. The opportunities for people that trained to became a teacher or to became a soldier or to became an engineer, help them because there&#39;s a lot of opportunities. And what I think is that Mexico could be one of the biggest country in the world if we help each other. If we open our own business, if we open our own companies and don&#39;t depend on other countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yeah. Those were all the </span><span>questions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that I had, but now I want to give you the space for you to say anything, anything that you want me to put in, anything you want to add or...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone hears this, I just want to let them know that take advantage of whatever opportunity they have if they&#39;re in the States. Just focus on the future because future is never... You never know what can happen, something can change, one little mistake can take you back. You can never regret it because you had the opportunity, you had the chance. I&#39;m not saying in my country you don&#39;t have that, but it&#39;s easier over there in the United States, it&#39;s really easier. You have everything to do someone or become someone because there&#39;s a lot of support and the government helps a lot. Here in Mexico, it&#39;s pretty much the same thing, but this is more difficult. You have to work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Are you satisfied with everything that you&#39;ve told me?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Marcos</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah? All right, awesome. Thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
