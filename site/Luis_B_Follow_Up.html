Since then, have things gotten better or worse for you here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s gotten better? I&#39;m going to read you stuff. Socially?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe socially things have been going great. I mean, they haven&#39;t been awesome. Like in my scale it&#39;s good, great and awesome. This is my top. It&#39;s been good. I can&#39;t really complain, but you know it still proves difficult sometimes. Mexico City can prove to be a very traditional place, a very unique spot for traditions, and people can sometimes be very, I don&#39;t know, hard to tackle on. Trying to talk to people has sometimes proven to be difficult, especially for these traditions, for these kind of stuff that they don&#39;t accept.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#39;s say, for example when I was living with my </span><span class="c6">p</span><span class="c1">a, sometimes people just didn&#39;t understand that sometimes there&#39;s people from another countries that they don&#39;t want to stay in their country, so they had to change. People don&#39;t understand that. People here don&#39;t understand that either. Either, I&#39;m sorry. Let&#39;s say for example, also sexual preferences. People of the same sex trying to adopt kids, that kind of stuff. Trying to talk with that kind of people has been proving very difficult, because I live ... well, I don&#39;t live-live on my house, but I have neighbors, a lot of neighbors like that, and it&#39;s awful. I&#39;ve seen some neighbors screaming to another couple of girls living there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lesbian couple? Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to get married, but it&#39;s weird because every time that they get into the building, all the people, or some people start screaming at them, shouting so many horrible stuff. It&#39;s horrible. But you know, I try to at least do my part and try to defend them. I try to step in and say, &quot;What the fuck is wrong with you, man?&rdquo; Sorry for the slur, but Jesus Christ it&#39;s awful just to see these people hollering at girls that haven&#39;t done anything to them, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a minute. So socially it&#39;s better or it&#39;s sort of no, not necessarily?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say better.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about economically?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About economically, I&#39;ve been helping my mom a lot, a lot in house. I&#39;ve been improving, I don&#39;t know, just like buying some wood, and buying some stuff and building some furniture myself. That&#39;s also </span><span class="c6">proving</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;quite a challenge because I didn&#39;t even know how to use my hands before. Seriously, I was so clumsy, so dumb. I used to drop stuff. Just by doing this, stuff spill on the table. But right now I want to say that I&#39;m better financially. I find myself in a spot that I&#39;m really comfortable in right now. Because of the ... If you want to say it like that, money has proven quite useful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any endeavor that I want to do in my house, like for example, I want to buy a new </span><span class="c6">furni-</span><span class="c1">, I want to buy a television for my mom. I want to help her to pay her credit card and some stuff like that. A year ago, interesting thing, I didn&#39;t know how a credit card worked a year ago, I didn&#39;t even know what the hell a credit line was, what the hell was a credit card for? I only knew that it was a magic piece of plastic that you gave to people and they just let you off the hook and stuff like that. But yeah, it&#39;s definitely gotten better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, things are going well with your mom, that&#39;s great. I&rsquo;m going to put economic input. So, family&rsquo;s gotten better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family has gotten better because I don&#39;t know if you remember that last year I was telling you about this kind of trouble that I was having with my mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I don&#39;t know if you remember, but I was telling you a year ago about some kind of problems that I was having with my mom. I don&#39;t know how to say it. The family situation was pretty tense. My brother was doing some stupid stuff, some really stupid stuff. He was messing with people that he shouldn&#39;t have messed with. My mother was really angry at the time at me for some stuff that I did. But I believe that in the end everything played out well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t even know why, because maybe it has something to do with the help that I&#39;ve been trying to get to her. Even therapy for me, therapy for her. We could go to therapy together and try to solve some stuff. Some stuff that she hasn&#39;t solved with me, talk with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;ve said you&#39;ve been getting quite a bit of therapy with your mom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. We&#39;ve been to a couple sessions together. After that we decided that it&#39;s better if we talk or sort things out ourselves. But it&#39;s also really great to have a third person in the room, sorting stuff out. Trying to tell what&#39;s important at the moment and what&#39;s not important to talk about. That kind of stuff. It&#39;s proven really useful. Mostly because I&#39;ve been able to actually hug my mum in a long time. Because when I arrived she hugged me a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used to call me sweetie, she used to call me </span><span class="c2">precioso</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c2">mi amor</span><span class="c1">, stuff like that. But lately things have gotten kind of sour between the two of us because of many stuff that happened, many stuff that she said, and I started to resent that kind of stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did she say?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did she say about &hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have things gotten sour?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe mostly things got sour because I didn&#39;t ask for ... I didn&#39;t actually tell her about Hola Code at the moment that I actually tried to get into Hola Code, I didn&#39;t tell her, and I quit my job really fast. Just the moment that I met Marcella and I met ____ and I met the others, I literally, the next day I was at the guy that was my boss at the time in TeleVisa. I said, &quot;I quit. Here you go.&quot; And he was like, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve found something better, man.&quot; I just ran out, and two weeks passed and my mom was like, &quot;Hey, do you think you can help me with the gas? It&#39;s like a thousand pesos.&quot; I was like, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll help you mom.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t have money.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; &quot;I quit.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I didn&#39;t tell her and she started getting so pissed at me because I was being irresponsible. I was being not&hellip; you know, I also saw the mistake that I made because getting into Hola Code, it was a period of time. I had to let some period of time pass before I could get in, before they actually saw my results on the maths tests, and the logic tests, and all that stuff. And also seeing if I was compatible, I was compatible with the program. It took some time. It took three weeks or so. So there was three weeks where I couldn&#39;t do anything but sit and wait, because I was dumb and I was excited. I started taking decisions without asking, actually consulting them with my mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We kinda had a rough patch after that. My mom always tried her best to support the both of us, but also my brother got into those things that I told you. He started messing with the wrong people, started getting into fights, getting into some weird stuff that I just really don&#39;t want to dig in. I don&#39;t want to know what the hell he was doing, because at one point I had to get him out of a place. I literally had to get him out so they could stop beating him. I don&#39;t know what the hell he was doing, but I really don&#39;t want to know. But it&#39;s interesting though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mom, building a relationship of trust with your mom, I mean, it was like most of your life she wasn&#39;t there, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean It was your pa and your ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my pa and my ma, but my mom is ... she&#39;s a really great girl. She&#39;s an awesome mother, but also she can prove difficult sometimes. Trying to talk with her, it&#39;s like, I don&#39;t really know you, you don&#39;t really know me, but we&#39;re trying, right? We&#39;re trying to get the best out of the situation that we&#39;re in. The moment that I arrived here when I was 16 she treated me like a kid, literally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was her little kid, I was her special boy and stuff like that because I seriously survived an accident that could have killed me when I was a kid, so I was her special boy. This and this and I had a ... I don&#39;t know how to say it. A blood clot in here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, blood clot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I also got my skull fractured. So when I was a kid, I was not even a kid. I was seven months old, eight months old. We were on my pa&#39;s. He had a </span><span class="c2">vocho</span><span class="c3">. He had a Volkswagen, an old Volkswagen, an old Beetle, and he was crossing one of these big avenues. I don&#39;t know the word </span><span class="c2">forma</span><span class="c3">, it was </span><span class="c2">su gentes</span><span class="c1">, &nbsp;something like that. So he was crossing the street, it was green, but some idiot just decided to just step in and decide to ignore the red lights. So bam, he bashed us out. We started to roll, and sadly my mom dropped me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom couldn&#39;t resist the impact that she dropped me and I did this, started to bounce. Now that I think about it, it sounds kinda fun, but it sounds horrible also. Because it&#39;s me I can laugh the situation </span><span class="c6">off</span><span class="c1">. So they just got me out of the wreckage. They got me out. I was in the pedals and stuff. They got me out, and they decided to just check what the hell was wrong with the baby. I wasn&#39;t crying, I wasn&#39;t doing anything. I was just like ... They thought I was dead. My mom seriously thought I was dead. She was crying. She was saying, &quot;I&rsquo;m so stupid. I killed my kid.&quot; She was crying, she was bawling on the street, and then my pa was like, &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s not dead.&quot; They checked my pulse and go, &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s not dead. Call an ambulance!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambulance came, they took me to the hospital. I had a fractured skull, I had a blood clot in here. My life was in danger, kind of, but then my aunt, her name is ____. We don&#39;t really get along because of some stuff that happened. Anyway, she came and she decided to step in and give me some of her blood. She gave me a transfusion and that was it. Luckily, because no one else in the family had my kind of blood. No one else was O positive. I believe I&#39;m O positive or I&#39;m O negative. I don&#39;t really remember, but it&#39;s one of the O&#39;s. Everyone else is A, or B, or &hellip; difficult, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Imagine what your mum must have felt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But, I was a special boy for a long time before of course. The stuff had happened with my dad, and they just decided to split, and she couldn&#39;t quite, I don&#39;t know, take care of both of us. I don&#39;t know if my pa saw that because he saw some weakness, I think. I don&#39;t know. So he just stepped in and he said, &quot;Hey, do you want me to take care of one of the kids?&quot; &quot;Yeah, go ahead.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought he offered you the option?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He offered my mom first because I was really a kid, and after that he asked me, &quot;Do you want to stay with me?&quot; When I was five and when I was four he decided to ask me because I was, I don&#39;t know, I was really, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the word for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precocious?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was kind of a precocious kid. I don&#39;t know. He just decided to ask me, &quot;Would you be happier with me?&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I mean I love you.&quot; He was like, &quot;All right then. Do you want to go with me?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; Then we decided to have a road trip, all the family. My pa, my ma (grandfather and grandmother) and me, and we just started to travel. Travel a lot. We went to the United States, and we started to travel, and then we decided to settle in Utah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just saw a house one day and he was like, &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re going to rent there.&quot; I was like, &quot;All right.&quot; He talked to the landlord. He was a really slow guy, but yeah, he was kind of an ass but he was also slow. So, everything was cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, initially with your pa and your ma, you just traveled around?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just traveled around. We were trying to find a place to live. A good place to settle in. None of the neighborhoods really sticked with him. He saw at least one problem, he said, &quot;No, she&#39;s not going to be happy here.&quot; So he just moved. He was like, &quot;Yeah, there&#39;s too many kids here. I&#39;m not going to find you.&quot; So we move to another one. He was like, &quot;Yeah, there&#39;s not enough kids here. Let&#39;s go.&quot; We just moved from state to state, we moved from city to city, mostly living on hotels, mostly just ... sometimes we even slept on the car. It was fun. It was really, really fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never took his sight off me, he never took his sight off my ma. They were really close. So, at that time, Sophia, my mom was taking care of some stuff in here, Mexico City, and we were with my grandpa, with my grandma, and just going around. Tried to find a place to live in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, wait a minute. So, things are better. Let&#39;s see if I can do this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s gotten better. Economic, family-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... work stuff. Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the security situation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about security situation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s better or worse?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;ve been having troubles lately.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s worse?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say good, but also not bad because I had the situations going on with my neighbors. Do you remember when I told you about this neighbor I had who was such an ass, who yells at the lesbian couple from the eighth floor?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They live just above me. I live on 703, they live on the 803, so, they live just above me. They are really silent, they&#39;re really nice. Sometimes they come and they ask for, I don&#39;t know, a cup of milk, or something. Some eggs, can I ask you for that? What&#39;s the name of the thing? They ask for hammers, they ask for stuff. They&#39;re building stuff in their house, and I actually been into their home. I&#39;ve actually been into their apartment and they are having such a nice place to live. I see it and I say, &quot;Hey, you want help? I can help you guys build some stuff. I actually have some practice.&quot; They say, &quot;Oh you would? Thank you.&quot; It&#39;s awesome because I can actually help other people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then there&#39;s this guy, he&#39;s a tattoo guy and he&#39;s using the flat to use it for business. He&#39;s a tattoo guy, so I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s just a really bad neighbor. He&#39;s not a good neighbor. He yells, he screams, he gets drunk, he smokes weed. I can get it if you smoke. I really don&#39;t care. But when you do it with the door open, even when there&#39;s kids outside playing, like, holy shit man. All right, take it easy. It&#39;s all right to smoke, but at least close your fucking door. It&#39;s all right if you smoke. There&#39;s no problem with that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don&#39;t actually like having the guy there. So I have a dog, right? I have a dog. I have this mix between a Maltese and schnauzer, so he&#39;s very pretty. He&#39;s very small, but he&#39;s also very loud. He&#39;s got a big, big mouth. He starts to bark at anything. So I&#39;ve been having trouble because of that. I&#39;ve been having some troubles with the guy because he-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting pissed at you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The thing that got him really angry was because my dog, sometimes he gets out because when my mom comes in, she opens the door and the dog comes out like a bolt, and he just starts running around. He pissed on his door, so he got really pissed. He got outside and he started yelling at my mom. That&#39;s when I got really, really pissed at the guy. I came out, my brother came out, we just decided to step in and say, &quot;Hey, everything all right here?&quot; And no, we just had some tough argument, had a really heated argument where my brother started to push him around, and I was like, &quot;Come on man. Just don&#39;t try to kill the guy because he&#39;s such an idiot. He&#39;s just an idiot.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn&#39;t know how to handle things. He could have just, like, be polite about it. How about, &quot;Hey, Miss, your dog&#39;s pissed on my door. Do you mind if you could ask one of your kids to clean it?&quot; That would&#39;ve been so much better instead of shouting stuff at my mom. Yelling really mean things. Started calling slurs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What apartment does he live in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What apartment does this guy live in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#39;s say I&#39;m on 703, this is 705, 708 and 701. It&#39;s like</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;all in line</span><span class="c1">. So he lives here on the 701.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&#39;s the one who screams at the lesbian couple?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s the one, and his girlfriend. I don&#39;t know what the hell they&#39;re into. They kind of look like, I don&#39;t want to say it, like they look like neo-Nazi or stuff like that. They don&#39;t look like skinheads, but they kind of look like. They&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t realize they existed in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I </span><span class="c6">don&rsquo;t know</span><span class="c1">. It&#39;s weird because they do have some stuff that really makes you think. They shout some stuff, they say some really anti-Semitic stuff. They actually talk about Jews a lot. We&#39;d be into the building committee and stuff like that, but they start to make an assembly and they start gathering people and stuff, to see what we&#39;re going to do with the building&#39;s money, what are we going to spend it on?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they start talking about another couples living there like &quot;They&#39;re Jews,&quot; or &quot;Oh my god, that kind of people shouldn&#39;t be living here. They have their own money.&quot; They just look at him and they&#39;re like, &quot;Dude, what the hell.&rdquo; I don&#39;t know what is his problem with most people. He doesn&#39;t like homosexual style of people, he don&#39;t like</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;hetero</span><span class="c1">sexual people. He doesn&#39;t like anyone. He just likes-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like he should be living in the United States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, definitely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a minute. What about the job? Is the job better or worse?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say better also because I&#39;ve been ... Just got into a project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What project?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know Love&#39;s by any chance? Love&rsquo;s, the gas stations?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those guys, they&#39;re actually developing a new application for their clients so they can get a-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love&rsquo;s, L-O-V-E-S?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. They are developing a rewards program. Excuse me. They&#39;re developing a rewards program for their clients for </span><span class="c2">puntos</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and benefits and stuff like that. So yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing right now. I&#39;m getting in touch with another guy who&#39;s in San Francisco, ____, and getting in touch with another girl who&#39;s from here, </span><span class="c6">_____</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and we&#39;re in the middle of our meetings. We&#39;re going to check out what we&#39;re going to be doing for the application, for the client, and if we can get in touch with the client, that would be awesome because we can get their point of view of what they want from us, what they want for the application.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be great because if we do our thing, they&#39;re not going to be pleased about it. They&#39;re not going to be very pleased with the amount of time, with the amount of the effort, and the amount of resources that we would be using with an application that they are not happy with, right. So yeah, it&#39;s just pretty good. Pretty good for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sound good, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just sound&hellip; good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to think that, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You really do. Your voice, everything. There&#39;s sort of an enthusiasm about it. There&#39;s some stuff that&#39;s shit, like this neighbor, but in the scope of things... You sound pretty good, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m also happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you say are the major challenges you currently face? Again, social, economic, job, families, security, or something else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family related, I would just want to say that the major challenges is trying to get in touch again with my mother. Trying to keep up with her, with the things that she does, with the things that she talks about. I&#39;ve been also trying to take that mindset off her that people from another countries are bad. She especially doesn&#39;t like Asian people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn&#39;t like Asian people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn&#39;t like them. There&#39;s this guy, Scott_. Do you by any chance know Scott? Scott_ was one of our TMs on Hola Code and she came to my graduation party and she met Scott_ and she was like, &quot;Who the hell is that guy?&quot; I was like, &quot;Mom, come on. Jesus Christ.&quot; I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been trying to take that mindset off her because every time that she does it I&#39;m like, &quot;Do you know that I&#39;m an immigrant too? Do you know that I shouldn&#39;t be here?&rdquo; I should be here, but I should&mdash; I have been the&hellip; right? &iquest;</span><span class="c2">Sabes?</span><span class="c1">. You know that I wasn&#39;t supposed to be here. You know that I am --- It&#39;s actually a pretty big miracle that I&#39;m here, and I didn&#39;t got killed on the way here. You shouldn&#39;t be that mean with people who&#39;s not from here. Maybe they are running from something. Maybe they want another opportunity here. Maybe they want to, I don&#39;t know, develop their life here. What&#39;s the problem with that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just stays silent, she doesn&#39;t say anything, but she does it again. That makes me so mad at her because I don&#39;t know what to do to change that mindset. I&#39;ve been trying to, I don&rsquo;t know, get her to meet different people, get her to know Cornelius, for example, Scott. Get her to know more people, get her to open up. But that&#39;s one of the biggest challenges for my family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you tell her about all the friends you have in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I sometimes tell her about, I don&#39;t know-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who were from all over, right? You had friends who were-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. Maybe if I talk with her about that time that she&#39;s just going to ... I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t talk a lot about the kind of life that I lived when I was on the States. I try not to think about it a lot, but I also tell her it&#39;s part of who I am. I also try to tell her that even though I&#39;m here, I&#39;m still there somehow. There&#39;s some people that just tried to contact me. For example, Andrea, Andrea, people like that. Just like the two brothers that lived in front of me. Those were two brothers were trying to contact me. &quot;Oh my God man, how are you?&quot; On Facebook. It&#39;s been really weird, and it&#39;s been really awesome because I&mdash; their father also knew me, they also knew my pa, they also knew my mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked a little bit on live chat, we also talked on the webcam and they were like, &quot;Oh my God, how are you man? It&#39;s been great to see you. Look how big you&#39;ve gotten man.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;You got your ears pierced?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;You got tattoos man.&quot; &quot;Yeah!&quot; They&#39;re really happy to see me, I&#39;m happy to see them because I know now that they are okay, that they&#39;re still alive somehow. They are not Mexican, but they are from Latin America. I never knew where they were. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s from Nicaragua, from Venezuela, or someplace like that. They were running. They were running from the government because I don&#39;t know what Tonio did. Their father did something really, really bad, and he messed with the government. He messed with people that he shouldn&#39;t have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was running from the police basically. Not from something bad, but mostly for the things that he was fighting for. For his convictions. And I can respect that a lot, but he also got his family in danger because of that. I always think that it&#39;s great to fight for your ideals, but not if you have a family. If you&#39;ve got a family and you&#39;re trying to fight for that, you&#39;re mostly going to get someone injured, or killed, or worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they the people who asked you to come stay with them after your pa died? You told me that there were all these people who wanted you to come and stay with them when you were just alone at home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not them, but mostly the people from the neighborhood that saw me outside. They saw me drinking, they saw me doing some really stupid stuff outside the house, and they were like, &quot;Hey, are you okay? I know you. I know your pa. Is everything all right at home?&quot; I was like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Are you okay though? Do you want to come home with us? Are you sure you don&#39;t want to come home with us?&quot; I was really... I don&#39;t want to say in a very bad state. I was in very bad state at that time. But I do remember a couple, a couple from the same block who lived there. They saw me and they tried to help me. They got me a blanket. They got me some soup in a can, but they helped me. They actually helped me a lot. A little bit, giving me probably 50 bucks, giving me some time to think, some space. &quot;Hey dude, you want a coffee?&quot; There was a week where I lived on the street. I didn&#39;t want to really want to go. I really didn&#39;t want to go home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was one of the biggest challenge. Trying to remember all that stuff. It&#39;s pretty big for me, because-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we&#39;re not going to talk about that. Have you taken any courses since you&#39;ve been back, since we last spoke?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses about tech, about ...?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything. Have you done any more studies since we last spoke?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, definitely. I&rsquo;ve taken the, uhm&hellip; Before I got into Love</span><span class="c6">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s, I had to take a training for automation. Automation is basically telling the computer via a software, some program, to tell him what to do. You write the code, you write the functions that you want the computer to develop, and then it does it for you. Let&#39;s say for example, I want to tell the computer to open Google Chrome. Go to amazon.com, select this product for me, put it on my cart and then buy it for me and send it to a direction. Send it to an address, to my address. Oh, but also you have to log in and put all your information. It has proven to be very fun, but also very challenging because I never knew anything about automation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I&#39;m stuck in this program. I don&#39;t want to say stuck. I&#39;m going to say that I am committed to this program for at least a year before the day I can develop myself into something else. What I&#39;ve been really trying to accomplish on web development is trying to get into a game developing&hellip; a place that can develop the games, like a company that&#39;ll develop this games. I know that Globant for change have a contract with EA, but EA that are not my favorites. There&#39;s better developers out there but it&#39;s pretty good. I can get into something great there like become a game tester, become a ... even a game developer, that could have been great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That could be great. So awesome. But yeah, I think I&#39;m committed right now to that. That has proven quite a challenge. Getting into studies, taking this automation program for at least ... We are on May still?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re still in May.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 1st I think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 1st, Jesus Christ. It&#39;s been almost a year. This is the month when I got into Globant like two years ago. Wait, no. We&#39;re 2019? June, June of last year. I&#39;m going to turn one year this year on June. So yeah, it&#39;s been great actually. I really like it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you currently working for pay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you currently been working in a paid job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how many hours a week?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how many hours a week? I work from nine to six, but that depends on the -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So 48 hours. Nine to six.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six, nine, 10, 11, 12. Three, four, five, six. It&#39;s a nine or eight hours a day. So eight for a </span><span class="c6">top fine</span><span class="c1">. I want to say 48. I want to say 45 hours a week. But mostly it differs because of whatever the project needs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you paid per day, per week, per month?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I get paid for a week, I believe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you get paid?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much I get paid? I get paid like 23,000 pesos a month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22, 23. Sorry. It depends because I just changed the project recently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;ve been on Love</span><span class="c6">&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">s for almost two weeks now, but the thing is that they are changing my pay. They&#39;re going to be paying me a little bit more. So I really don&#39;t know the exact amount, but it&#39;s a little bit higher than that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, who do you currently live with? You live with your mum?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live with my mother and my brother, and a dog.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s no place for a dog here. So, which of the following of your relatives lives in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom and my brother. I believe a couple of aunts, and my other grandparents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah. Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The ones from the side of my pa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which ones are you in contact with? All of them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope. They did some kind of&hellip; With my mom of course, yeah, and my brother. But that&#39;s it. We&#39;re a really small family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re not in contact with the others?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did some really shitty stuff to my mom a couple of years ago. It was really horrible. They just literally decided to steal from her. She had a couple of jewels, of really great value. Some watches that my father&hellip; I&#39;m sorry, my father and I, my pa, like ____, my pa, he decided to give some to my mom. &quot;This is your birthday watch. Go ahead and keep it. This is a bracelet, go ahead and keep it. This is a ring. Go ahead and keep it.&quot; He started to give some really beautiful stuff to my mum and she decided to keep it in her mom&#39;s, their place. So my aunts lived there. ____ and ____, they live there, and then just one day&mdash; things, they disappeared. Out of thin air, they disappeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She called my mom crying and saying that she got robbed. Literally people came inside the house and she had scratches on her shoulder, like if someone was teasing her. We always knew that it wasn&#39;t like that. They wanted to even blame my brother. Because of the things that we were doing at that time, they wanted to blame my brother. They called him a ... what was the word? &ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Malviviente</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo; That&#39;s the word they used. It was really enraging to know that they had the audacity, the guts to even say that they got robbed, and they robbed the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literally a couple of years after that, the guy that was dating ____, he told my mom that they did it. He said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I also helped. I&#39;m really sorry. I want to help you pay back. To help pay you back. I&#39;m going to give you a couple of thousands because that&#39;s what they paid me. But I don&#39;t know about your sister. I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s going to be doing from now on. My pa knew that they were really effed in the head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was your mom&#39;s sisters?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. She has two sisters. My pa in total had three girls. ____, which is the smallest one. My mom is in the middle, and ____ is the biggest one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older one and the baby ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older one and the baby, they just decide to, I don&#39;t know. Just completely&hellip; It&#39;s over. They&#39;re not really great people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any relatives from the US? No, or yes?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, yes. A couple of aunts and a couple of people living there. I believe their daughters still live there too, on New York I believe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you in touch with them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because they are from the side of my pa. So, they are from the side of the family so I don&#39;t really get in touch with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you considering returning to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a big question. I really don&#39;t know. I have a life here, and I never thought that I would have a life here. I really think that I would, but maybe just to travel. Maybe that&#39;s it. I wouldn&#39;t go back to living there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&#39;ll say </span><span class="c6">just</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for... &lsquo;just to visit&rsquo;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to visit probably, because if I think about it, I don&#39;t know. If I go there, probably things will get sour real fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;wanted to ask you,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">i</span><span class="c1">f you&#39;d stayed in the US, what can you imagine or what do you think you would&#39;ve done with your life? Let&#39;s say that your grandpa and grandma hadn&#39;t died and you would have stayed, what do you think you would have done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. When I was there, I was still studying in ____. I was in ____. I was still studying at ____. I was studying arts. I always wanted to pursue something in arts, in drawing, going digital, some stuff like that. I always loved computers, so I always wanted to try something like that. Probably right now I would still be working at that cafe. I would be trying to help my pa, my ma a little bit, because to be honest I never knew what my pa did. Financially, how he stabilized the situation. It was shady because every time that I asked my mama about it, she always said that he packed some cards in places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put envelopes and things and stuff like that. I always saw him with big ass boxes on the table. It was four in the morning and he was still working. I don&#39;t know what the hell he did for a living. It was kind of shady, yes. I don&#39;t know what the hell he was doing, but he also kept me alive. So I can&#39;t really say that I ... I don&#39;t know, that I have a grudge against him. I don&#39;t, I really don&#39;t. But, I always wanted to know more about the guy. He was an awesome dad, but he was even a better friend and that&rsquo;s a problem. But yeah, I think that I would mostly still be working at the cafe, working from, I don&#39;t know, nine to five, nine to four, depending on the shift.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t think you would have gone to university. Or college?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s the problem. I was never suited for school. I was always the clown of the class. I was always a clown. I never really liked paying attention. I never really saw myself going to university. Mostly because of the money issues. I could&#39;ve gone to public school, I could&#39;ve gone to public university, but I also knew that it wasn&#39;t going to be as good as if I paid for my own education. But there&#39;s also the problem about the tuitions, about the money that I would have been owing to the schools. Because of my tuition, I was going to be owing a lot of money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know kids, like right now ____ for example, this kid that I was telling you about, he&#39;s just finishing university, and he&#39;s already in crippling debt. His dad cannot help him at all. He&#39;s in a wheelchair literally. They tell me that he has ... I don&#39;t know what disease he has, but right now he&#39;s in a wheelchair. And it&#39;s really, sorry for the word but it&rsquo;s really fucked that he got kicked out of his job because of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the father, or your friends?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, ____. The guy that lived in front of me, and his sister.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he&#39;s your age, or the father? Who&#39;s in the wheelchair?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father is in a wheelchair. This kid when I was in fifth grade, he was in fourth grade. He was a year and a difference. He was always a good kid. He was always a good friend because he could always hang out with his sister, doing stupid stuff on the street. It was really fun, but also at the same time it&#39;s really screwed that he can&#39;t do anything for his father, and his father can&#39;t do anything for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are your dreams here? What are your hopes and dreams for your life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are my hopes and dreams? That&#39;s a tough one. I want to say that living a stable, happy life, it&#39;s my dream. Being able to look back and never really feeling bad about anything that I&#39;ve done. Never really regretting anything. That&#39;s my goal. Always looking back and say, &quot;Wow, look at how far I&#39;ve come.&quot; Right now I never thought that I could do this on my own, that I can live together with my mom now, I can live alone also, but I also want to help her in any way that I can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that the Mexican government does enough for returning migrants?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s a difficult question in topic of migration, mostly because none of the two countries have a good relationship between each other. They don&#39;t have a good communication channel, and also mostly because let&#39;s face it, America gets the president that they deserve. The United States get a president that they deserve, they deserve. Mostly because I also saw a video of a guy trying to eat a tamale with the whole ... so stupid. Sorry that I just remembered that. But let&#39;s face it, people chose a racist, homophobic, and stupid president because they deserve it at the moment. They don&#39;t really deserve a guy like for example, I don&#39;t want to say Bernie Sanders. They don&#39;t deserve any other Democrat because they don&#39;t really want it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They deserve the shittiest thing that it comes at us, because let&#39;s face it, they haven&#39;t been great neighbors at all. I want to say that they kind of get the same treatment here in Mexico. When you see a couple of tourists they get scammed on the street, they get robbed. Let&#39;s be honest. None of the two countries is really great with the other. We are not in great terms, we are not the best neighbors, but that could change. Let&#39;s just, I don&#39;t know, try to settle a good example for other countries, try to settle a good example for other neighbor countries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my last question for you is, do you consider yourself more Mexican or more American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now if I think about it, there&#39;s a quarter of me that is still American.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quarter?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say a quarter. Another three quarters would be Mexican, because of course there&#39;s race, there&#39;s the lineage, there is of course the ... Maybe the appearance also. Sometimes I even slur when I talk in English because I am losing the touch with one of my languages, it&#39;s one of my languages. I&#39;d like to believe that I&#39;m native of both. I talk English and I also talk Spanish. I want to say that I&#39;m really good at both, but I also lose some practice in here Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s not a lot of people that I can go to and I can talk in English. There&#39;s only, you for example, people in the street that are asking for directions and stuff. Stuff like that, but I want to say that I ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s the quarter that&#39;s still American and one of the three quarters that are Mexican?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say they&#39;re my memories, mostly. The memories that I made there, the friends that I helped, the people that I met, that&#39;s my quarter. Also the language of course, but mostly my memories. Mostly the things that I did, the things that happened, the things that I&#39;ll never forget. For example, my first kiss in fourth grade, that was something. I&#39;m never going to forget that stuff. Those little things are the things that make that quarter American. And the other things, like my pa was a Mexican. He was always a Mexican, he was always proud to say he was Mexican. When they asked him, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; He never said anything but Mexico. &quot;I&#39;m from Mexico, I&#39;m from Guadalajara.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never want to say anything else than that. I always ask him, because when I was 12 I ask him, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re going to get in trouble if you keep saying that you&#39;re Mexican, and that we might be illegal here. We&#39;re going to get in trouble man.&quot; He just looked at me, he said, &quot;It&#39;s not worth it. Who am I if I lie about the person that I am?&quot; I always admired the guy because of that. Because he had balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had balls to be saying that kind of stuff. In the meetings that we had for our parent to teacher meetings, whenever I got called at school because I did something stupid, every time that they asked him that same question, &quot;You don&#39;t sound American, where are you from?&quot; He always said, &quot;I&#39;m from Mexico. What&#39;s the problem with that?&quot; He was brave. He was very, very brave, but he was also very dumb.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes you Mexican?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes me Mexican? My pa, my ma, my mom, my brother. The people that right now I can call friends from here, from Mexico, they are my friends. They are my anchor to this country. Because if I didn&#39;t have anyone here, I don&#39;t know what would be holding me back to crossing that freaking border again and just going whenever, wherever, working on whatever. I don&#39;t know. I told this girl that I&#39;m dating, she&#39;s 28 and I&#39;m 22, so it&#39;s the difference. ____, this girl, she&#39;s really special for me because we met on the drawing ... </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I went back to art school. I&#39;ve been trying to keep touch with the things that I learned in high school. Like the styles that you learn, the things that you learn, how to draw even, because when you do this, this is not drawing, this is drawing. Go in a straight line. That kind of stuff. I met her there, and lately I&#39;ve been getting really close to her. I really feel really close to her, so I think that&#39;s another one of the reasons that I don&#39;t want to leave the country, and I think I&#39;m Mexican. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look so happy. You&#39;re in love, man!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say no, but I also want to say yes, but&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long has it been?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like we&#39;ve been dating? I want to say four months, five months probably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to be in love.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s kind of soon to say that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look radiant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know about that, but I really like her. I really want to be here with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, can we stay in touch?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we can, always, anytime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t want to lose touch with you again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time that you want, just message me. Do you want me to come here and help anything, I&#39;m okay with that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I&#39;m back there, because I&#39;m only here for two weeks now, but I want to stay in touch with you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can always do that. You can always message me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few people who I met with who I feel incredibly close to, and you&#39;re one of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Anita. I also want to stay in touch with you, so anytime that you want to message me, you want me to come over here, I&#39;ll always be available.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we write this book, I&#39;ll ask your permission, but we may film parts of your story if that&#39;s okay with you.

We&#39;ll talk about that with you if it&#39;s all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;ll talk about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it&#39;s going to help someone, I&#39;m always okay with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re welcome.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
