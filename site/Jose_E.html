class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So, my name is </span><span>Sergio</span><span class="c4">, I&#39;m here conducting an interview. Thank you, </span><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;De Santiago Perez, for joining us today. I first want to start off by thanking you for being part of this interview. I know it&#39;s not an easy thing to be able to talk about your experience, share your story, share everything you&#39;ve been through. And we really want to thank you for that and acknowledge you for everything that you&#39;re embracing, for being open about it, for being so welcoming. So, I guess the first question that I have for you is, why did your family migrate to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my family migrated to the US because, like I mentioned earlier, my father used to beat my mother. According to her, there came a time where she couldn&#39;t take it anymore and she decided to leave my father. But, she couldn&#39;t go just next door, to the next town, because she knew my father and how Mexico works, was influenced in the political game. And, she knew she couldn&#39;t get away from him just going next door, to the next town. So, she decided to go head north, and that&#39;s how we ended up in America.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was your hometown violent where you grew up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I grew up as a little kid just remember playing. I really don&#39;t remember anything about- the only violence I knew was when I used to see my father beat my mom. Because, I was young, but I still remember seeing my father beat my mom. So, that&#39;s the only violence that I encountered in Mexico at that time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s tough. When you and your mom left, what did you leave behind? What do you remember of Mexico that you ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that I can miss from Mexico was obviously my childhood friends. Because, my mother just didn&#39;t bring me. She brought all of us. Me and my siblings. So, when I look to the right, I see my brothers and sisters. My mother decided to head north first, so that was something that we missed first was my mother because she wasn&rsquo;t in the scene for a month. So, when we headed north, we met up with my mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she left you in your home town?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she left us without us actually knowing because we were kids. So, if there was something I was looking forward to, it was seeing my mom as a kid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did that to protect you and your siblings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you? You said you were ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I remember I was about five going on six.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first memory in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first memory in the US, I actually remember the road to America, and I remember getting the bus from Mexico. Somebody instructed us to play asleep, and then we woke up. We actually, trying to play asleep, fell asleep and woke up in the road. And hamburgers was what we had for lunch. And that was my first taste of America, because I had never ate hamburgers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were just, &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; And they informed us that, &quot;When you see some buildings, we&#39;re there.&quot; And then eventually we got to see the skyline of Dallas, Texas, and we&#39;re like, &quot;We must be here.&quot; And then that&#39;s when we met up with my mother. And that&#39;s actually my first memory out of America.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, did you go to school in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I went to school in the US. I did from first grade all the way to high school. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any teachers or people that you remember from school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I definitely remember my teachers because I didn&#39;t know English when I arrived in the US, so I always had to have bilingual teachers. I guess she was my second grade teacher, her name was Miss Rodriguez. And I actually had to have her two years because I had the opportunity to bump up to third grade when I was supposed to go to the third grade, but they didn&#39;t have a bilingual teacher. So, they suggested that I stay in second grade, so I got held back in the second grade. And Miss Rodriguez played a big role in that, because she suggested it. And that&#39;s why I remember Miss Rodriguez. She was in my elementary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And middle school, I remember Miss Lewis. When I was in middle school I was already hanging out with the wrong people, the wrong crowd. Gangs, drugs. And Miss Lewis always just kind of taught us to, &quot;If you&#39;re already street smart because you&#39;re in the streets, be book smart too because this is where you get your book smart.&quot; So, that&#39;s one thing I always remember about her. According to her, &quot;I&#39;m not going to stop y&#39;all from doing what y&#39;all go to do. Y&#39;all already got that in y&#39;all because y&#39;all in the streets. Y&#39;all can spot a gang from a mile away. But, I need you to spot these books from a mile away too. Because, without it, you ain&#39;t going to be able to do nothing.&quot; So, that was Miss Lewis in my middle school days.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then in high school, we got Miss, I can&#39;t even remember her name. But, she was an old vet teacher. And she was real strict on us because she made sure we knew our history as far as Blacks and Mexicans go. Our people didn&#39;t have it easy, so why do we throw away what we have in front of us. So, that was something that she really made sure she touched. And, that&#39;s part of being in America.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you mentioned you started getting involved with the wrong crowd. One of the things for me, I grew up in Pomona, California. I was born in the US and I&#39;ve grown up in a neighborhood that was also really challenging. I have a lot of friends that ended up in jail and shot and got killed. And so, when I was in middle school, that&#39;s when I was hanging out with people that might&#39;ve not been the best of friends, getting into fights. Was there ever a moment where you thought ... when was the moment that you realized, &quot;Oh wow, I&#39;m part of a gang, oh wow, I&#39;m involved in the wrong crowd&quot;? What led up to that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I never had that wow moment, &quot;I&#39;m part of this.&quot; I just had that, &quot;I want to be part of this.&quot; And when I was part of it, I wasn&#39;t like, &quot;Wow, I&#39;m part of it.&quot; Because, you work your way to that. So, when you work your way to that, it&#39;s like you deserve it because you&#39;ve done whatever you had to do to be at that. So, there was never like a, &quot;I&#39;m part of this.&quot; You just know you are, regardless of whatever anybody says, because you know there&#39;s rules you&#39;ve got to go by. And when you do them, you&#39;re in. People can say you&#39;re not, but you know you are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been in the streets since I was like seven years old, and I got here when I was like six or five. So, I&#39;ve just been running the streets as a kid. I just grew up in the streets as a kid. I remember my mother, single mother of five in America without any help from the American government because we&#39;re not American. So, therefore we have no rights to nothing as far as help from the government. So, we don&#39;t get no food stamps. We don&#39;t get no medical. I don&#39;t even know as far as medical goes, but we wouldn&#39;t get no government cheese like other people did. And a single mother of five, I had to help my mother. I remember as a kid, probably I was like eight, and mopping the neighborhood Washeteria. Because, the lady used to give me 2, 3, dollars. But, because my mother came from work, two jobs and she used to sleep, and there&#39;s no milk for my baby sister, so I kind of, out of my kid zone, go try to find some money to buy milk for my little sister. So, behind me not having a father at home, I was able to be in the streets all day. And I had to do what I had to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While doing what you had to do, was that more like a friend group thing that you found? Or, was that more of like, you knew you were looking to be part of?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, when I arrived from Mexico, my family are from Mexico, and usually what they do is work. So, they&#39;re going to teach you anything that&#39;s work. So, first I started off as working. I used to help what we call a hobo, that cleans cars at the car wash. I used to help him dry the cars. And he used to give me 2, 3 dollars. So, I&#39;m helping mop the Washeteria, and over here. So, that was part of working. So, before you know it, I started hanging out with the wrong crowd. It&#39;s no more working. It&#39;s stealing. So, instead of going to pay for a gallon of milk, I steal a gallon of milk. So, that&#39;s how I started hanging with the wrong crowd. And it just grows and grows. Your morals disappear because you practice it so much that it&#39;s just like, there&#39;s no shame. Somebody said, &quot;You still ain&#39;t in?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that any different from other people that were US citizens that you knew?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they were doing the same thing, because the majority of my buddies were US citizens. And, we were doing the same thing. I grew up as an American. They call themselves Mexicans too. There was no dividing us. Until you get to a certain age that they start asking me for, &quot;Where&#39;s your social?&quot; &quot;Let me ask my mom.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You worked in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you work in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first job in the US, you could say legit job was as a busboy. I still remember the name of the restaurant. It&#39;s called Cheddar&#39;s. And awesome food, as a busboy. But, to work there, I had to go find some, what you call papers. And I got me the fake identity with my real name though. And I started working as an 18 year old when I was 14, as a part-time job. Because, the demand in my household was big. My mother was still a single mother. Yeah, so I just had to help out. And that was my first job, at 14, working at Cheddar&#39;s. It has a bar. Where everybody thinks that I&#39;m 18 not 14. I grew up pretty fast too as far as my structure. So yeah man, that was an experience too that I lived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what was your favorite job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite job was, my older brother, I have an older brother, he&#39;s two years older than me. He started working at a tire shop and he told me, &quot;You want to get your-&quot; I forgot exactly the words, but insinuating that you want to be on your own? &quot;You want to do what you want to do? Get you a job. Come work.&quot; So, I decided to go help my brother on the weekends at the tire shop. I picked up on the tire shop business, and I actually enjoyed it. And that&#39;s actually, to this day, I love changing tires. You don&#39;t have to pay me to change a tire because, I don&#39;t know, I just like it. I don&#39;t know why. I just like it. So, that&#39;s actually my favorite job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you thought about making a business here in Mexico with the tires?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I have looked into it. I thought about it. But, there&#39;s no funds. So, without funds you really can&#39;t. And if anybody knows about the tire shop business, there&#39;s money behind a tire shop business. And, I haven&#39;t just been a worker. I mean, I have been a worker, an employee. But, I&#39;ve also been a manager of a tire shop, so I know a little bit more about how the business actually works. And there&#39;s money in a tire shop business. I love doing it. Why not make money with something you love to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what was your least favorite thing about the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My least favorite thing about the US was going to jail. I love everything about America. Oh, and FYI, in Mexico, they </span><span>only </span><span class="c4">say it&#39;s one America. So, we call the US America, and Mexicans call the whole, </span><span>they</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;say Mexico and America are America. So, we call the US America.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Least favorite thing was jail. How did you end up in jail the first time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the first time I ended up in jail, my mother called me, I was working at the tire shop. She&#39;s like, &quot;What did you do last night?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Nothing. Why? What happened?&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;Well, some detectives came looking for you.&quot; And I said, &quot;For what?&quot; She said, &quot;You tell me. Well, they left a card for you to call.&quot; So, I called them and they said that it wasn&#39;t me. And I said, &quot;All right, well they got the wrong person because I didn&#39;t do nothing. I was at work.&quot; And before you know it, they pay me a visit and they pick me up. The police picks me up and they take me in for questioning. I was out on a previous bond for possession of heroin. And when they picked me up, it violated my possession of heroin, and they booked me. So, I was incarcerated. And that&#39;s how I ended up in jail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they booked me together for the possession of heroin and aggravated robbery that I did not commit. So, before you know it, I&#39;m being charged with possession of heroin and aggravated robbery. And that&#39;s how I ended up in jail. And I had to prove my innocence. And I wasn&#39;t successful at it, so I took probation. And they let me out on probation. That&#39;s how I ended up in jail at 17 and got out when I was 18.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you came in when you were 17 and you came out when you were 18?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what happened next?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, I was on probation. I was into drugs and I was into heroin. And I started consuming again. And I knew I was dirty, so why go, oh, because they had me with the piss test or UAs twice a month. And I knew I was dirty, so I&#39;m like, &quot;Why go check in when I know I&#39;m dirty?&quot; So, I stopped reporting. So, when you stop reporting, they put out a warrant for you. At 18 I decided to flee to _____, to work at a tire shop over there too, because I was in the tire shop. And I started a new life in _____. And that&#39;s what happened. Broke my probation and I was living in _____.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, one thing, there&#39;s always a big stereotype about Mexican American men being in the US committing crimes and all of these things. What would you attribute the reason you became involved with gangs or with [inaudible 00:20:21]?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, today as a grown man, back then I used to blame it on my father because I grew up without a father. And my cousins around me had a father and they walked a straight line, according to what I was seeing with my eyes. But, today I come to realize that it&#39;s not because of a father, because I also know people that don&#39;t have a father, and you can say they walk a straight line. And today I&#39;m biblically influenced, and the Bible helps me walk a straight line. And when there&#39;s no biblical influence in a person&rsquo;s life, there&#39;s no direction. So, that&#39;s my answer to that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of the favorite things you got out of the US? Favorite things you liked to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, there&#39;s too much to, everything. I mean, I lived in America and we went swimming. We went to field trips. Buddies of mine invited me to their house parties. There&#39;s parks. Just everything about America is my favorite. I really don&#39;t have a favorite. America is my favorite. Whether it&#39;s good or bad, you enjoy it. I don&#39;t really know how to explain it. Now that I can see, you don&#39;t realize this when you&#39;re in America. But, when you&#39;re out of it, you&#39;re like, &quot;Whoa.&quot; I always considered myself as a Mexican because I was born in Mexico. So, when I had my American buddies, as far as US citizens, I&#39;m like, &quot;You&#39;re not Mexican. I&#39;m Mexican. I&#39;m an original Mexican. So, I used to make fun of them because they claim they&#39;re Mexican. I said, &quot;No, you&#39;re not. I am.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you got deported the first time, I come to realize that I was not a Mexican, as I used to claim. Why? Because, Mexico rejected me. They told me, &quot;You&#39;re not a Mexican.&quot; In Mexico, they call us gabachos, gueros [foreigners, pale skinned], whatever. And we&#39;re like, no, because we know that in our mind that&#39;s a white person, and we&#39;re not white. We&#39;re Mexican. But, it doesn&#39;t come to settle in until you&#39;re in another country. I&#39;m like, &quot;But, I used to tell my buddies I was a Mexican. But, I come into another world and tell me I&#39;m not a Mexican.&quot; And that&#39;s when I came to realize, I&#39;m a full-fledged American. I just never realized it. So, yeah man, it&#39;s just ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of things did you do that made you feel American? Or, what kinds of things do you still do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America is a culture, a people, and a home. That&#39;s what America is to me. This is my culture, it&#39;s my people and it&#39;s my home. So, I only found that in America. So, when I come to Mexican, I don&#39;t find no culture, I find no people, so therefore there&#39;s no home. America&#39;s all I know, and I find it extremely hard to let go. Because, without it, then what am I? This is who I am. It&#39;d be denying who I am. I go by Jose De Santiago in America, and I come down here to go by </span><span>Jose</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Rolando De Santiago Perez. That&#39;s real weird. And to this day I still practice with my name, Jose De Santiago. But, legally I got to write </span><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Rolando De Santiago Perez, because that&#39;s how it goes down here. If I don&#39;t, I make it harder for myself because it&#39;s a different person. And then when you try and get my papers in order, it doesn&#39;t add up. It&#39;s the math. You want to struggle or you want to get it right? So, I decided to get it right, because I&#39;ve been getting it wrong for far too long. So yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what was&hellip; you were released and then how were you deported? You were deported twice?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How were you deported the first time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first time deported was one of the most hardest thing I ever encountered, because I was incarcerated to begin, on a three-year sentence. I did it all the way to the door, meaning I pulled the whole three, out of the state of Texas. And be I left, the last month, everybody thought I was an American. So, when I used to tell my buddies, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to Mexico.&quot; Like, &quot;What?&quot; My incarcerated buddies. So, now they started referring me to people that are from Mexico. So, I started looking into the matter, and they start lacing me up with just information. But, no kind of help for useful information. If anything, fearful information, because they started telling me about how the cartels, how they prey on people like myself. And all the illegal activity going on in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I&#39;m involved in gangs at the time, so I want to act like none of this affects me. But, inside it does because it&#39;s just a reality that I&#39;m going to a country that I&#39;m not familiar with. And not just that, the violence is at its highest at the time. So, I was actually frightened to leave. I was in no rush to get out of jail. I was frightened to get out of jail. I was safer in jail. And, once I do get to what they call Huntsville, the walls, where they release everybody, I was hoping to get released there because everybody was getting released was getting released in America. But no. Unfortunately ICE got there. When I get there, I tried to pull what we call a okidoke. I&#39;m like, &quot;Why you ain&#39;t letting me out with the rest of my buddies?&quot; &quot;You speak English?&quot; &quot;Of course I speak English. I&#39;m an American.&quot; &quot;Where were you born?&quot; &quot;In Park Lane Hospital.&quot; &quot;What year?&quot; &quot;&#39;1990.&quot; They&#39;re like, &quot;Hold on, let me check your paperwork, because we have you here as a Mexican national.&quot; I said, &quot;Man, you&#39;ve got the wrong person.&quot; And I gave it everything I could until they&#39;re like, &quot;Nah, you ain&#39;t fooling nobody.&quot; But, I had them going first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigration officer asked me if I was afraid of Mexico, but because there were people around me, I didn&#39;t want to say yeah. My ego wouldn&#39;t let me say yeah. But, he sensed something. He didn&#39;t tell me though. And then, as I&#39;m going through the deportation process, they sent me somewhere else. This man put me in an asylum. So, I was in an asylum for two and a half months, just dry, sitting there. And I said, &quot;Well, will I have a chance?&quot; I started looking into the matter. And before you know it, I started seeing people that had no hands, legs, that actually were in a way that their life was in danger in their country. I don&#39;t stand a chance. So, I started doing my math and I said, &quot;I waive all my rights, and deport me.&quot; After I waived my rights, they deport me, after two months and a half. Then they sent me to an immigration center. It&#39;s a ICE detention center. I was there for 25 days. And just holding me until they can get a bus filled, whatever they&#39;re doing there. And then they deported me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we continue, how long before ... so, the judge issued the order. It sounds like you gave up voluntary departure. Is that the word that was given, or was it a deportation order?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never see no judge. The only judge I seen as far as immigration goes is when I was, in 2011, when I seen a judge on my violation of probation, that&#39;s what I went and did the time for because I violated. The judge was looking into my paperwork, and she was like, &quot;How did you even get probation?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Excuse me ma&#39;am?&quot; And she&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re an illegal. How did anybody give you probation? You should&#39;ve been deported already.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Excuse me ma&#39;am, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re an immigration lawyer.&quot; And that was just my reaction, because I believe her job was to sentence me, not to be worried about my legal status. So, that&#39;s the only immigration scenario I ever had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And them when I was in asylum, I never asked for asylum. The ICE person put me in asylum. And then when I was there I was trying to get out of it. But, I was in a sense, I was afraid of going to Mexico because of everything I hear about Mexico. I never been to Mexico. When I waived my rights, they sent me to immigration center. I don&#39;t see no judge or nothing. It was just to hold on until we get a bus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after you sign the paperwork to self-deport, how long was it until you actually wound up in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month? Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month. And as I&#39;m walking to, I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m getting deported, even though they telling you can get deported to here, it doesn&#39;t click in because you&#39;re telling me something, it&#39;s like telling me to remember something that I&#39;m not familiar with. It&#39;s hard. Only thing I remember, I&#39;m being deported and I wait in the bus till everybody gets off. I said, &quot;I wonder if this man will let me walk back.&quot; The bus driver. So, I was playing it slow until then. And he&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;ve got to hurry up.&quot; So, I hurry up and I&#39;m walking slow, and I think that&#39;s when time stopped in my life. Because, I realized that I was actually getting deported. Not until I was at that bus did it click on me, &quot;Jose, you&#39;re getting deported.&quot; Through the whole time, because when you&#39;re in prison, bus after bus, you get bus at the prison. They move you all around Texas, when you&#39;re in prison. So, the bus situation wasn&#39;t anything new to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when I was in that bus and he&#39;s telling me to hurry up, and I have no chain on me, I realize that I&#39;m leaving the country that I love, and for good. And as I&#39;m walking, I&#39;m talking baby steps. And the bus driver, he instructed me, he said, &quot;I cannot leave until you cross that line. Cross that line boy.&quot; And he has a 12 gage in his hand. I have baby steps. I&#39;m taking baby steps, and I just can&#39;t walk. Until he says, &quot;I said cross that line. You can walk as slow as you want after you cross that line.&quot; So, I stop at the line and I look at him. I turn my head and look at him, and then he just, how you say, cocks the shotgun, &quot;Keep going.&quot; But, it was the hardest thing I could ever do, but I did it. And then when I did it, it&#39;s like time started moving again. But, it was a different time because it was a time that you&#39;re not aware of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You feel like you become a victim. You feel like everybody is after you once you cross that line. You think everybody is out to get you. So, once I got to the, what they call the INS, Instituto Nacional de Inmigraci&oacute;n [National Institute of Immigration], I just learned that at the time, I didn&#39;t know nothing about it. Because, I recently did some studies on Mexico. And, I got there, they gave me a sack lunch. What made me comfortable was that I seen the Mexican marines there, so that kind of gave me a little bit of, &quot;Okay, this might be a little bit safe.&quot; And they gave me a sack lunch in a paper bag and a phone call and a bottle of water and a paper ID. Oh, and they offered to pay half our bus ticket if we had some kind of funds on us. And if we didn&#39;t, they have a place called, La Casa Del Inmigrante [The House of the Immigrant], where they can help you out. And, I decided to get on a bus and get out of there and go to wherever it is that I&#39;m from. So, that&#39;s how my deportation process went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave us a ride to the bus station, paid for my ticket, half my bus ticket. And I called my family, in this case my sister. And she was asking about me, if I was all right. I&#39;m like, &quot;Why?&quot; And she&#39;s like, &quot;In about 10 minutes I got a phone call, they were asking me for ransom money because they had you.&quot; So, when I got that, the fear jumped back in my life. I clicked and didn&#39;t leave the station, not even to get a taco, and I was starving. Because, the fear was still in me. Shit. And then, anything that I picked up in prison regarding Mexico, as far as, don&#39;t let people feel your accent. Because, they can pick up on your accent that you&#39;re not from around there. And that&#39;s a sign of money, meaning that you&#39;re worth something. Why? Because you have Americans in America, and they have money. So, I just stayed quiet until my bus got there. I stayed quiet until I got to where I was from, because I was scared to speak. I was scared for them to identify me. And that&#39;s how my process went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when you were in detention, what were the conditions like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horrible? Compared to prison?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to state prison, compared to federal prison. State prison and federal prison are two different things. So, comparing ICE to federal and state prison, is horrible. They violate so many things that it&#39;s unbelievable. I actually got moved out of a prison behind me filing on them because they ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filing a complaint?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Filing complaint, because I also, how do you say? I advocate for people? I believe you should not violate a person&#39;s rights. And if you do and I can help, I will help. I have been helping. So, behind that, they moved me. Because, they won&#39;t do it to me, but they&#39;ll do it to them. But, since they can&#39;t write English, they can&#39;t file. I told the man, &quot;You know what you&#39;re doing is wrong, right?&quot; They said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; I said, &quot;I&#39;m a write you up.&quot; They said, &quot;You got to learn first.&quot; So, he didn&#39;t mean it for me, because he wouldn&#39;t violate my right. He violating somebody else&#39;s rights. Meaning, they don&#39;t know how to write. So, that&#39;s the kind of atmosphere that you live in ICE.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you filed a complaint, was it for you or for someone else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me first and then I said, &quot;Might as well help the rest of them.&quot; When I filed a complaint, they had nothing but illegal people, they doing it to an American tank, where they live real nice. So, they&#39;re aware. They treat the Americans nice. And I don&#39;t mean nice as far as something extra. They just give them their portion. The ones that are illegally, they give them the scraps. So, I&#39;m accustomed to live a certain way because I&#39;ve been incarcerated before. It isn&#39;t my first rodeo. I said, &quot;What&#39;s going on here? What&#39;s this? What is that? Hold on, let me write to the Warden. Let me call my family.&quot; When you have your family calling up here, the majority of the people in there can&#39;t call. Why? Because they&#39;re family&#39;s in Mexico. My family is in America. And they&#39;ll call somebody. They&#39;re going to send an email. They&#39;ll call somebody.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when they know that, &quot;Get him out of there, he&#39;s starting too much mess. Put him where we&#39;ve got the Americans.&quot; So, after that, I was filing with the Mexican Council. And when they came to visit me after all the filing, I&#39;m like, &quot;Look, this is what they did to me.&quot; And I said, &quot;I can&#39;t continue filing on something that&#39;s not being nice.&quot; But, I do. There&#39;s certain people that have been filing. I&#39;ve been helping them out, and they know a little bit. I&#39;ve been instructing them on how to continue filing. So, you can continue with them. But, they instructed me that, since they started filing with me because I have a lot of time to do, they are going to be there for a little bit, so they can&#39;t continue the process. So, they needed me. And I said, &quot;Well, I can&#39;t. That&#39;s basically it.&quot; That&#39;s how I describe the ICE centers. They&#39;re horrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re, how do you say, inhumane?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. There&#39;s not enough food. The phone costs are super expensive. What I mean expensive is, if I&#39;m in Texas and I&#39;m calling Dallas, it should be like a local call. They&#39;re charging me $10 for 15 minutes. And I call Oklahoma City, where it&#39;s another state, and they&#39;re charging me $3? There&#39;s a conspiracy going on in there. Immigration is America&rsquo;s new cash cow. And I can&#39;t figure that out as far as the little studies I&#39;ve been researching. When you read books you get informed, and then you get inside living it, you put A and B together. Post, Texas has probably a thousand residents. In just the prison that they have in there, it&#39;s a private prison, has over 2500 inmates, illegal inmates. Post, Texas, just by the population of inmates, has more population than the population that is in Post, Texas, as residents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so, the living situation in ICE is horrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to when you were returning to Mexico, taking the bus, where did you end up? What is the hometown that you went to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I&#39;m from is called San Luis Potos&iacute;. And once I got to the city, that is San Luis Potos&iacute;, something about it kind of gave me some sort of calm. I felt like I was out of the danger zone. And there is danger zones in Mexico. And if you are a tourist going to Mexico you can look up the hotspots. I didn&#39;t know that. If I would&#39;ve known that, I would&#39;ve have my family send me one. So, once I got to San Luis, I feel a different atmosphere, and waited for a relative that was supposed to come pick me up. My family are from, I really don&#39;t know. They&#39;re just from the mountains, somewhere in the mountains. So, I figured, catch a taxi and come get me. No. More like, catch a bus and get off a bus and get on another bus, and then they catch a taxi and they come get me. So, it took him about five hours to come get me. So, I waited there for five hours. And eventually my uncle got there, and he took me to where we&#39;re from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kind of still have an image of where I was from as a kid. I was looking for that house that my grandma had, and I never found it. And then they showed, this is the house. And I was like, &quot;For real?&quot; And I&#39;m like, nothing like the image that I had. But, they just took me in and just started feeding me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you ever seen your uncles or aunts before?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My uncle, the one that took me in, he&#39;d been in America before as a worker. So, I had met him before in America. But then he returned back to his family. So, I never knew nothing about him. I got deported in 2013. I probably seen my uncle in 2003. And he was familiar, but it was like, &quot;Okay, you&#39;re my uncle, but you&#39;re still a stranger. I don&#39;t even know you.&quot; So, that&#39;s the only family that I had at the time, and he took me in. They&#39;re into farming, chickens, pigs, cows. They live off the land. There was nothing else to do but that, so I started learning a little bit the culture and the trade or whatever they&#39;re doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a relative of mine tell me, &quot;If you don&#39;t get out that town, because it&#39;s not even a town. If you don&#39;t get out of wherever you&#39;re at, you&#39;re going to stay there for the rest of your life.&quot; And that kind of moved me, because I&#39;m like, &quot;She&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been here like three months now and I&#39;m doing the same thing.&quot; You don&#39;t make no money because you just live off the land. So, I decided to seek more relatives. Do I have anybody in the city? And I did have somebody in the city, so I started moving to the city. I moved to the city. Basically, I&#39;m a tourist in Mexico because my family sends me a little bit of money. They pay my rent, my bills. I can&#39;t get a job. Why? Because, at that time, they were strong on discrimination with the tattoos. They want workers, not people that know their rights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a cousin that, you can say, a bum. And if they would hire him before they hire me, that I have school, I know English, I can type, that I can do this. So, something isn&#39;t right. As I go through time, they don&#39;t want people that know what they&#39;re doing. They just need workers. About a week ago I went to a job interview. I take my resume and everything, and they&#39;re like, &quot;Hold on, are you all right?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yes, why?&quot; &quot;You&#39;re not fit for this job.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Why not? I need a job.&quot; And they&#39;re like, &quot;No man. This is just for people that come to work.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m coming to work.&quot; &quot;No. You have too much education.&quot; I said, &quot;What?&quot; They said, &quot;I&#39;m just going to be honest with you. You have too much education. The job you want is sitting in an office.&quot; I said, &quot;No, I want to work.&quot; They were like, &quot;No, you&#39;re not going to get hired.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is recently. So, back then my job application hasn&#39;t changed too much. They want people, as the company ... this is my opinion on Mexico&#39;s companies. They just want people that come to work, not people that want to grow and want to grow in positions and stuff like that. And when they ask me, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; I just express myself. I&#39;ll start at the bottom and work my way to the top. There&#39;s not another way. Who wants to be in the same position forever? No. But, I guess they don&#39;t want to hear that. So, behind that, tattoos. Basically, they always gave me the tattoo thing, that if you have tattoos it&#39;s real hard for you to get the job. And we&#39;re talking 2013, 2014. When I got to Mexico it was like in December, starting 2014. And I couldn&#39;t get a job. And I still can&#39;t get a job. My skills have increased. My resume is longer. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in Mexico, but that&#39;s how that works.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re facing job discrimination it seems?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was any of that because you were a migrant or return migrant?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say it also has to do with that too, because they always make sure, &quot;Are you a deportee or deportado?&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Yes.&quot; I have values. Why lie? Yes, I&#39;m a deportee. And I always say. I even have a Facebook page called Deportado No Agotado [Deporte</span><span>d Not Exhausted].</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;So, that might have something to do with it. I don&#39;t know. But yeah, there&#39;s definitely discrimination in Mexico, as far as I&#39;m concerned. There&#39;s rejection in every corner. I met certain people that like us, and when I mean like us, that like what you&#39;re bringing to the table. But, those usually are people that want to be somebody in life. They have goals, because they know we know English, and they want that to rub off on them. But, if they aren&#39;t a person like that, they just hating on you. They don&#39;t like you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me growing up in America, I used to be like, &quot;Man, why are Americans so racist when it comes to immigration?&quot; I was one day in Mexico in 2014, in San Luis Potos&iacute;, in a bus, and I was listening to this conversation that these Mexican nationals were having. And they were talking down on, the words they used was, &quot;When are these immigrants going to stop coming to our country?&quot; So, we have Mexican nationals in Mexico saying, &quot;When are these immigrants going to stop invading our country?&quot; They were talking about other Central Americans. So, on the immigration thing, it&#39;s not just America. When I used to feel in America, I went to feel it in Mexico regarding other people. What I felt towards me in America, sometimes I used to be called wetback. I felt the Mexicans doing it to other people. So, that&#39;s everywhere. But, when you live just in an area, you never leave that country, you can&#39;t experience what&#39;s out there. So yeah, Mexico&#39;s real tough on discrimination too, as far as immigrants, deported people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have faced a lot of discrimination because I refuse to let go of my American culture. I love my American culture. It&#39;s who I am. And Mexico wants me to let go of it. And I don&#39;t want to let go. I don&#39;t even know how to let go of it. And behind that, you get a bunch of people not liking you. &quot;Why are you speaking English?&quot; &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Sometimes I don&#39;t know how to say certain things in Spanish, so I say it in English. And whatever I don&#39;t know how to say in English, I say it in Spanish. I don&#39;t choose. That&#39;s how it is. So, I&#39;ve been studying also on Aztec culture, and the Aztecs themselves, they were a combination of two tribes. So, that&#39;s what we today as, what I consider myself, a combination of Mexico and America. We&#39;re a new breed. And the only ones that can understand us is the next one that&#39;s next to me. Because, we don&#39;t choose a side. We&#39;re in the middle. So, nobody else can understand us. And as long as they can&#39;t understand us, they can&#39;t ... if they can&#39;t see this, they can&#39;t understand us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that&#39;s where the discrimination comes behind, because I don&#39;t be like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m an American in Mexico.&quot; They want you to choose a side, and I refuse to choose a side. Why? Because I can&#39;t. It&#39;s like telling half of my body not to work. No. I want my whole body to work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be yourself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. And being myself is being me. So, in Mexico, we have been right there, Mexico wants you to let go of something and just stick to something. They don&#39;t want you to be in the middle. Either you are or you&#39;re not. Behind that you get so much discrimination. And also the cultures in Mexico are so different. Because, in America, as you&#39;re familiar, I don&#39;t know if you ever, when was the last time you want to take a girl out and behind just taking her out, you got to go meet her whole family. I mean, I don&#39;t remember in Dallas ever doing that. You take a girl out, you ask her out and you go out. Over there they have different cultures. Some are tighter than others. So, you&#39;re like, &quot;What? I&#39;m not trying to marry you. I&#39;m just trying to take you out. So, when you don&#39;t adapt to this, you get discriminated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think they&#39;re treating you or discriminating against you because you&#39;re different?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s the reason why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, because we&#39;re different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any reason why they would want to do that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I mean, I don&#39;t even know how to explain it. But, we return to where I was speaking about, I don&#39;t want to let go of who I am. I embrace who I am. I love who I am. But, for me, in order to fit in Mexico, I got to let go of it. And, that&#39;s something that I&#39;m not going to do. Why? Because that&#39;d be pretending to be somebody I&#39;m not. Pretending to say that I like mole, when I love cheese burgers. Pretending to say that I like tacos when I love pizza. Pretending to be somebody I&#39;m not. No. So, I don&#39;t want to pretend in Mexico. I want to live. And living is being me. So yeah, Mexico, it ain&rsquo;t America, that&#39;s for sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Mexico, have you ever been approached or recruited or attempted to be recruited by bad people?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Behind the same thing. They say, one day one buddy told me, he said, &quot;You&#39;re bad for business.&quot; I say, &quot;Why is that?&quot; He said, &quot;Because you don&#39;t know how we role.&quot; So, it&#39;s about knowing how they think, how they move, how they react. So, it&#39;s like putting an illiterate as CEO of a company. No, you don&#39;t even know how to read. Because, we&#39;re not familiar with their ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I left America, when I left Mexico, my bad. When I left Mexico, my mom only brought in her luggage percentage of Mexico. She couldn&#39;t bring Mexico with her. My mother herself had to adapt to America. So, she only gave us a little bit of what she brought. The rest was all America. So, I can&#39;t understand Mexico. Why? Because, I&#39;m clueless to Mexico. I can only try and sometimes pretend that I understand what they&#39;re saying. The body language is different. So, it&#39;s a whole different scenario.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you recommend people migrate to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Mexico? In my shoes, yeah. Not in their shoes because this is their country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you feel more Mexican or more American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American. Yeah. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s like taking an animal out of its habitat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think from your experience, what the criminal justice system being so close to people, why do you think so many young Mexican men in the US turn to crime again? Do you think...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, my thoughts is because they have no biblical guidance in their life. That&#39;s it. You don&#39;t need a father. You do need a father, but if you&#39;re instructed in what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong as a kid, whether it&#39;s from your father or your mother, you&#39;re going to have principles, morals that you believe in. And that is your guide, that is your boat. And you&#39;re going to be all right. But, today, the households are broken. There&#39;s no guidance. There&#39;s houses that have fathers and mothers together, families, and they end up broken because there&#39;s no biblical guidance. And to have biblical guidance you&#39;ve got to read the Bible. So, that&#39;s my take on that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants like yourself reintegrate to Mexican society better?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open up a program for, you could say, what is it? DACA? What is DACA? Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, for us. Basically, what Mexico needs to do for people like myself is build us a community of people like ourselves. They have it everywhere. I&#39;m out of Dallas, Texas. They have a place called Little Mexico, Chinatown, Little Italy. We need a Little USA in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, then the final question. Why do you think many people in Mexico have a negative perception of returning migrants?</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.30j0zll"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they&#39;re not willing to adapt. They&#39;re not willing to adapt to Mexico. Because of the stubbornness you can say. Because, [inaudible 01:03:26]. You tell me to work in the fields for the whole day, when I can just get educated. There&#39;s a difference. Adapting means forget about what you know, what you learn, what you have, and get to work and pick up that shovel. That&#39;s adapting to Mexico. And forget about everything you know and what you learn. Pick up that shovel and let&#39;s work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they don&#39;t like that you have a higher standard ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. In America, we get taught as kids to brush our teeth every day, if anything, three times a day. When you come sharing that with a Mexican and he doesn&#39;t, you know how bad he feels? You spoke what you were taught, and now you just gained an enemy. When you speak on what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong, this is a scenario. &quot;You see that girl over there? Man, she&#39;s fine.&quot; &quot;Dude, she&#39;s 13.&quot; &quot;Ah man, we&#39;re not in America.&quot; I said, &quot;What?&quot; I&#39;m not gonna adapt to Mexico. When you see a dude and they want to fight, &quot;Oh, let&#39;s go jump him.&quot; &quot;Nah man. Let him fight on their own, one-on-one.&quot; &quot;Nah man, we get him together.&quot; &quot;Nah dude. Let them have a fair fight.&quot; There&#39;s ways that I have been instructed as far as America goes, that I refuse to let go. If you don&#39;t let go of that, then you don&#39;t fit in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That actually reminded me of something else. You said you got left for dead once. What happened and when did that happen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived to the town where I&#39;m from, it&#39;s called Mexquitic de Carmona, I started hanging out with the towns people. And before you know it, people used to pick fights with me behind me speaking in English. Behind saying that I&#39;m not a Mexican. And me reacting I am, we would get into arguments and I get into fights that I try to avoid. Because, I&#39;m like, &quot;Leave me alone dude. I don&#39;t want to fight.&quot; But, when they touch me, I got to defend myself. And growing up in the streets in Dallas, I learned how to fight, defend myself. In Mexico, they really don&#39;t know how to fight. They just kick. They do not use their hands for too much. So, you&#39;re usually going to win.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after enough fights, people just don&#39;t like you. They reject you, and then they try to hurt you. But, when they can&#39;t hurt you, one day at a local party, at a Catholic festival thing they had going on, I was dancing with the girlfriend that I had at the time. The party finished. Somebody picked a fight with me because I had, you could say, the prettiest girl in the town. Before you know it, all the people that had some altercations with me had something to do with it. And they stoned me, they dragged me, they kicked me, they threw me. They did everything but kill me, thanks to God. But, behind the same scenario that we do not fit in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say we, because I wasn&#39;t the only one. I had a buddy of mine in the same scenario, that was rejected everywhere. The girls like us because we&#39;re like something different. We&#39;re exotic in Mexico, when it comes to girls. So, the townsmen can&#39;t stand that. Envy. But, it all leads back to the same thing. Yesterday I went to a gym and I was speaking with my girlfriend/wife, and you can feel the vibe. The people don&#39;t like you. Why? Because, they can pick up your accent and they can know you&#39;re not from around here. If it was just another regular Mexican dude, it&#39;d be all right. But, behind the simple fact that we&#39;re not from around here, and they can pick up on it, just in the accent, they dislike you. And more if you have a pretty girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it just leads back to the same root of us not being from here. We&#39;re from here, but we&#39;re not from here. Same thing I would say if I was in America. I&#39;m from here but I&#39;m not from here. So, it doesn&#39;t change. We&#39;re a new breed in the cultural sense. Because, we have a different perspective on things. We don&#39;t choose a side. We&#39;re not so racist as other people are. I don&#39;t even know how to explain, because everybody has their opinion and their take on it. But, we&#39;re something different. And we definitely do not fit in in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, one thing behind that page I told you, it&#39;s called Deportado No Agotado, the goal is to put us together online and then build our own community. That&#39;s the main goal. There&#39;s enough of us in Mexico to have a community. But, first we got to find each other. Because, if we don&#39;t find each other then ... we got to find each other. If we can find each other online and hook up online, and exchange thoughts, ideas, how do we do to overcome, where are they hiring people like us, we can make it. But, we got to come together first. So, that&#39;s a little bit about the page that I started. So, what the Mexico government is not offering for us, we are going to do for us. Because, we only can understand what we&#39;re going through. So, at the end of the day, Mexico can&#39;t do nothing for us. And that&#39;s that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Jose, so much for your time. Is there anything else you want to say to finish the interview?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, if I could put my little extra thought on this is that, thank you for this interview. And I hope this interview ain&#39;t the last one, because behind Deportado No Agotado, I have to call it DNA, it has a lot of potential to grow. And it&#39;s not just because I&#39;m saying it. Because, it&#39;s a demand that we need as individuals in Mexico. And, I really appreciate it if there&#39;d be more interviews regarding DNA, because I know the problem and I know the solution. Why? Because, I live the problem and I have the solution. So, I used to write the Mexican Council all day regarding this. &quot;What kind of help do you have for a person like myself? I&#39;m a Mexican national out of San Luis Potos&iacute;. Send me what you got for me.&quot; There&#39;s nothing there for them to send because they don&#39;t have nothing. But me, I have identified the problem, and I also have the solution, thanks to God. And all we just need is funding and to bring all these people together and make it happen. It takes time, but it&#39;s going to happen. Because, there are already too many of us in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obama, I think he deported over half a million of us on his two, what is it called?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terms in office?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c4">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Some have returned back. But, some have decided to stay. And those are the ones I&#39;m looking for. The warriors, because it&#39;s not easy being in Mexico. So, those that have decided to stay, I&#39;m seeking for them. And I hope they&#39;re also seeking for me, because we need to link up. And, that&#39;s a little bit about what Jose </span><span>De Santiago</span><span class="c1">&#39;s got going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sergio</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Jose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jose</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.
