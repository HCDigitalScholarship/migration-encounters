I&#39;m with Jairo, doing the interview. What is the reason why your family went to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you can say the reason was, well, the reason my family went to the US was for a different life. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They come from big families. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They come from agriculture. Where I&#39;m from, there&#39;s nothing but agriculture surroundings. So, big families, little money, no money. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They saw how we were going to end up. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But you can say they saved me from&hellip; um&hellip;. the type of lifestyle that&#39;s there. They gave me something that, uh, no other person from my hometown has, that experience in life. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I tell them a story about my childhood, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, and it&#39;s like a movie to them. Like, &quot;Which movie you see?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Y&#39;all tripping. It&#39;s my life.&quot; It&#39;s a whole different experience that you grow up with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I </span><span class="c6">mean </span><span class="c5">the reason was, they gave us that schooling, the American studies. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. That learning that was given in the US. Also</span><span class="c12">,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;a different lifestyle. But, they did it, I guess, for that lifestyle. For a different life. For better opportunity. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what&#39;s the first memory that you have of the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, my first memory was, it&#39;s crazy because I remember when I arrived, it was like a DART station. I remember I was with somebody, I didn&#39;t know who. But, I remember I was with somebody. I remember seeing all white. I remember I ate a little fucking sandwich. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I was at the bus stop, I remember. I would see that bus stop. I would imagine that bus stop. It was all white. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the DART, in Dallas. The DART bus stop. But I was young. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. So, but that was my first memory since a kid. I was three when I was brought here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you remember then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just crazy. One of my memories, I would remember it as a youngster. That, and I remember eating dirt in Mexico. [Chuckles]. You know what I&rsquo;m saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were eating dirt in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I remember like, I was young like and they always said I would leave and go back and forth from one house to another one. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. And uhh, where I live at, it wasn&#39;t always cement. There was dirt. So, I remember it as a young kid, I remember it was raining. I picked it, I tasted the dirt. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. It tasted good. When you smell that rain and it hits the ground and it smells like wet floor, that&#39;s what I remember. But yeah, I remember that and that DART location.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you went to US school. Who do you remember from your schooling?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, yeah. I went to the US schools man. But, most I remember is always getting involved into something. It was always me; you know what I&rsquo;m saying, being Mexican, the other kids being African American. So, we always got into it. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I would get into it with Mexicans and Mexicans. But I remember there was always a fight. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I had nobody to defend me. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I had no cousins. I had nobody. So, I had to stand my ground, you know what I&#39;m talking about? I grew up. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. In the neighborhood, it was all blacks. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. It was me and three other homeboys you could say. Little homies. My other homeboy, &quot; Like yeah, I got you.&quot; We would take care of each other. But, most of the time it was just me by myself. So, I had to stand my ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember since a youngster I got into it, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, with African American, with black people. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But, I remember getting jumped, getting chased by these people. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Like It was a crazy life. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Since a youngster to my high school years. Even after high school, I still got into it. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. We would cross roads and like, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; You know what I&rsquo;m saying. For the disrespect they would give me. I had to give them, you know what I&rsquo;m saying&hellip;I had to teach. &quot;Yeah, I might be one deep. Yeah, I might be by myself. But, just because I&#39;m one deep by myself, you&#39;re not going to disrespect me for being Mexican, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, or my people.&rdquo; So, anytime they would disrespect my people, we got into it. &quot;What&#39;s up man? What you saying my nigga? You ain&#39;t white my nigga. I don&#39;t know why you disrespecting us like that. You don&#39;t like being disrespected, why you disrespecting us though like this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, since a youngster, middle school, high school, elementary, preschool, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. it was always there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you always have. Do you remember the altercations that you had with African American students and with ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like I mean, I would like I don&#39;t know if you know. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They like to put in fear into people. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They&#39;re loud. But, once you get into it with them, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, they&#39;ll soften down. They&#39;ll give you their respect. As long as you stand for it, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. you stand your ground, you don&#39;t fold. That&#39;s what it was. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But, most of the altercations were because I was a Mexican. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. There was, uh, in Dallas, in the pen, they got into it, you know blacks and Mexicans. Blacks and Mexicans, they brought that out to the streets. I remember my homeboy. My homeboy was black. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. We was in pre-K together. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. That nigga one day just comes out the blue, starts hitting me. I&#39;m like, &quot;What the fuck&#39;s wrong with you dog? You&#39;re my homeboy dog. What you doing?&quot; I remember we was walking. We walked from the cafeteria all the way to the slide&hellip; boy hitting me. I got tired. Turned around. &quot;Man, I told you to stop man.&quot; Turned around, started swinging. We was all the way by the soccer field. I brought that boy all the way back to the slide. &quot;I told you. Why you fucking with me?&quot; After that, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, it was hell. He brought his cousins and his uncles. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Like It was always like that, dog.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In middle school I was at a basketball game and this boy come out. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. He just cut me. I&#39;m like, &quot;What you doing man?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;What? It&#39;s whatever. You want?&quot; I remember that boy hit me twice. I was like, shit. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. He had come hard. I&#39;m on the floor, what the fuck? You know what I&rsquo;m saying. My glasses fell off. I made sure my glasses was straight. If I broke those glasses, I was not going to get another set, so I had to save them. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. High school, same thing. I remember the homeboy was fighting another person, and this black kid comes in trying to sneak one from behind like, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; &quot;What, me and you? Whatever.&quot; After that man, every day I had a fight. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. It was to a point where I had to line my fights up. People come up to me like, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey man, I already got two fights after school, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. So, you&#39;re going to have to wait till after them.&quot; People look at me dumb like, &quot;Are you serious? You just schedule me to a fight? Where they do that at?&quot; You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I&#39;m like, &quot;Shit, yeah fool. I mean, I&#39;m already busy for after school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was crazy because it would be like masses. Went and got guns pulled out, all crazy stuff like that. But we would stand our ground. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I even got into it with my own people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you think that you got into so many fights because of ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being Mexican.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Mexican?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because we were different. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. We were lesser than them. There was a history, where I&#39;m from, like, like, they were scared of black people. I wasn&#39;t. I&#39;m like, &quot;Nah man. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They going to respect me.&quot; And I brought that mentality down here. Like I don&#39;t care who you are, who you run, who you shoot, how many you kill, man. You&#39;re going to respect me. You know what I&#39;m talking about? Yeah, but most of the times it was because I was Mexican. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Because I was big. I was always big. So, they looked at me as an easy target. But yeah, most of the times it&#39;s because of that disrespect towards who I was or how I was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it was just because you were Mexican-American. Did they know that you were undocumented too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, yeah, they knew. I would always represent. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. &nbsp;I would&#39;ve told them all where I&#39;m from. Because, I&#39;m not from here. I&#39;m from Mexico. Since I was a youngster, I remember I would tell my teacher, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m from Mexico.&quot; You know what I&rsquo;m saying. &nbsp;I was always representing who I was, where I was from, since an early age.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you would always say ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m Mexican. I&#39;m not no Chicano. I&#39;m not from Texas. I would&#39;ve loved to be from Texas, but no, I&#39;m from Guanajuato, Mexico. That&#39;s where I&#39;m from. GTO I would say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you think that affected you growing up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How it affected me growing up saying I was Mexican? Well shit, I mean, it made people look at you differently. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Like, &ldquo;You really out here saying you&#39;re Mexican? You know when people call immigration?&rdquo; I was a person that really didn&#39;t care. I&#39;m this and if you don&rsquo;t like it, I&#39;ll move around. That&#39;s what I liked about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that sounds like you were in a lot of fights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot. I even got some on YouTube, bruh. Got into it with this big black bull. Taunting me. But I&#39;m talkin&rsquo; bout, he&#39;s huge bruh. Huge monster. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But this bull. My homeboy was fighting his homeboy. These some grown people. We was young. We was 15, 16. These niggas was like 22, 21. Boy, talkin&rsquo;. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. smack. I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, you&#39;re going to need to shut it bruh.&quot; He looked at me like, &quot;What you going do?&quot; Like, &quot;What? Man, it&#39;s whatever.&quot; &quot;You want it?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s whatever man.&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to say yeah, but I wasn&#39;t going to say no either. I was like, &quot;Whatever.&quot; Once you say it&#39;s whatever, it&#39;s going down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m over here trying to duck and weave, bob and weave. Tried to reach for him. Man, I couldn&#39;t reach his face, dog. He was huge, bruh. I&#39;m over here like, &quot;Damn man.&quot; Tried to jump. You know, I had to hit that Super Mario punch, dog.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, aside from being involved in a lot of fights, were you involve in other kind of...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal activities? Well, I mean, with certain pride and respect, you, you know what I&rsquo;m saying. &nbsp;You get involved with a lot of stuff. You know a lot of people. So, you could say, I mean, shit, I was young. I was money hungry, dog. Sometimes, It was a time when my parents had it tough, so I mean I had to do what I had to do to bring something to the table. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I was able to help out my parents, pay a couple bills. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Pay a couple of rents. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I was young. I wanted an Xbox, but I had to give my dad that money. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. It didn&#39;t hurt me. I&#39;ll do it. &quot;Man, I got more houses I can rob. I ain&#39;t tripping. Take that. I come back with a thousand more tonight.&rdquo; You know what I&rsquo;m saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you get that money?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what I&rsquo;m saying. People borrow, let me borrow things and I would sell them, you could say. And uh, sometimes, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I knew people that did stuff and I knew people that sold stuff, so I was that middleman. I connected this, connected that. I mean.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were the connect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Some people like to call it the middleman. But yeah man. I was doing things. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Moving myself around, since I know people, people know me. Sometimes people would ask me to take care of them. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Like a bodyguard. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But, with that came other things. I taught people this. They taught me that. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what were some of those things that you learned or some of the things that you did?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, I learned how many grams go into certain things. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. How much to put in certain stuff. Or, how to do, you know what I&rsquo;m saying. How to talk. How to handle business, what prices had to be. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. So, would be looking at stuff like that. But, I mean, bag, bag stuff up, stuff like that. Where was the good stuff. I moved around. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Where to buy cheap guns or connect people with stuff. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. That&#39;s what we did. One thing led to another. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever get involved in like drug activity too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I&#39;m not going to say yeah, but I&#39;m not going to say no. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. We had to do what we had to do. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But I was mostly a user, bro. I was mostly&hellip;I became a user instead of a provider. I would provide whatever I had, if I had it. If not, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, I was using it. Because, at the points where you&#39;re the one connecting, you&#39;re trying to get people the good stuff, so you&#39;re trying the stuff out. Make sure you got the best out here. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Made sure I always had the best. I made sure it looked right. The quantity. People always would look for me because of the quantity and the quality. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I had that good stuff. I had it for the low. It was a little time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever claim a gang?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah man. We ain&#39;t got no claim gangs. Up in Texas we ain&#39;t got no gangs. What you do. You got your little claims, little cliques, stuff like that. But, I had homeboys. Some homeboys was Bloods, others was Sure&ntilde;os, others was Crips, others was Rolling 60, some were Tango Blast. You know what I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; bout. I even had some white brothers who were Aryan Brotherhood. That straight Nazi type of stuff. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But me, it&#39;s just me. I had a little clique. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. It&#39;s like a group of us. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Brown and Black Soldiers, stuff like that we called it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it was just like a clique?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. We were a set group of people that were known. We got our backs. Cause I mean. I&#39;m telling you, when you have a lot of beef, not too many people want to hang out with you. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Sneeze]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bless you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what led to you being um ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Sneeze]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bless you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... deported?

When you become the connect, so you try out a lot of things. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. &nbsp;I started smoking that PCP when I was a dishwasher, man. I was with this homeboy from East Dallas. He was an Eastside Homeboy. Like, &quot;What&#39;s up bro?

But like, yeah, he was like, &quot;I smoke wack, that PCP.&quot; &quot;What the fuck is that dog?&quot; Like, &quot;Shit, you never tried it?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Fuck, no bruh, but let me see.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever seen PCP parts when people get tripping, get whacked out, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They run around butt naked in the hood? I never did it. It gave me an effect. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Like trip out. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. So, I remember I had smoked a couple of sticks, A couple of Forties. I was at the 7. And every time I would go to that 7-eleven, I always had an altercation with the Arabian guys, man. They would always just ask me for my fucking Texas ID. And these niggas already knew me. Like &quot;You know I&#39;m a Mexican man. Why you always tripping? Let me see your ID. You ain&#39;t from here either nigga. Let me see your Arabian ID?&quot; He goes, &quot;Man.&quot; And I&#39;m telling you, when I got arrested there, I remember me and the cops got into it. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. It had to be to a point where there was seven of them escorting me to the vehicle. They couldn&#39;t get me in. They had to pepper spray me. You know what I&rsquo;m saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember on my way to the jail, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I was out here tripping, cussing them out and stuff like that. But, I mean, that&#39;s what led to my deportation. That, and I had a lot of charges. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I got caught up with illegal substance. I got caught up with a firearm, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, without being registered. Hollow points, one in the chamber. Like, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They had me. I remember at 16, they was trying to give me conspiracy theory. I&#39;m like, &quot;What the fuck you going to do? What you going to put me down for that?&quot; &quot;Because you&#39;re always making mess. You&#39;re always involved in something.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Fuck, it&#39;s not my fault.&quot; Like stuff like that. One day I guess they get tired. The government gets tired and fuck it, you</span><span class="c6">&rsquo;re going back</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how were you treated in the ICE facility?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In jail? I mean, the food sucks. I&#39;ll tell you right now. I was hungry all the time dog. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. You&#39;ve got to work something out over there. That food at the jails man, it&#39;s really bad. Give them some salt. Teach people how to use salt. But, Nah I mean, other than that dog, it was a&rsquo;ight. Couldn&#39;t complain, dog. It was colder than a motherfucker for a minute. Couldn&#39;t complain though. It&#39;s better than nothing. Have you ever been to jail here? Oh man, it&#39;s crazy. I&#39;d rather be in jail over there than here, dog. It&#39;s crazy. They don&#39;t feed you like over there. They really don&#39;t care if you die right there in the cell. I&#39;m like, damn. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Like, everybody&#39;s musty. No AC.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when you came back, what did you do when you came back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back, like I said, I was a security guard. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I was working in the fields because my grandpa has a couple of land. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. So, I would help him. Every time he used to, how do you say that shit? When you spray poison for the animals, so they won&#39;t eat the crops? You know what that&#39;s called?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insecticide?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. There you go. I remember we used to do that. Take our little wheats, little mustard plants. Yeah, we used to. That&#39;s what I used to do though. A lot of stuff. I used to do all that stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when you were back, did anyone ever try to recruit you for a gang or for like a group here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told me about it, but I mean, no. Nobody ever came across me for that stuff. And that because I&#39;m not, I mean, I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t respect regular laws. How am I going to respect no, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. gang laws, no organized crime laws? You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I&#39;m the kind, when I don&#39;t like something, I&#39;m not going to listen to you. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They don&#39;t like that kind of people. They want somebody that&#39;s dumb. They put in the corner, they give you a gun to defend it. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I&#39;m not dumb. I like to say I&#39;m not dumb. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. But, yeah. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talked to you about it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told me about it, but I&#39;m like, &quot;Nah, I&#39;m good bruh.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m not going to listen to you dog.&quot; &quot;Nah, but you got to listen to me if you want in.&rdquo; I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;d rather be broke than be listening to you dog.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what? They offered you money and you were like, &quot;Nah, I don&#39;t want to follow rules&quot;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were trying to offer me my spot, work. But, I had to sell it for this price. And I was like, &quot;Nah. I&#39;m going to sell it for my price, and I&#39;m going to sell here, I&#39;m going to sell there. I&#39;m going to sell wherever I feel like it.&quot; &quot;No, you&#39;re going to listen to me if you want to.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, fuck you then, man. Don&#39;t give me nothing, dog.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it didn&#39;t work out. Did you still sell it on your own or?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Once they cut you off, they cut you off. It&#39;s kind of hard to get it from somewhere else. That, and you get involved in a lot of stuff man. I really ain&rsquo;t have nobody to look out for me, so I&#39;m like, might as well leave that alone. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. And it was good too man. I can&#39;t even lie. If not, and I would&#39;ve been dead right now. Disappeared. But yeah, I mean nah bruh. I don&#39;t listen to regular laws. I&#39;m not going to be listening to their laws.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, since you&#39;ve been back, have you still kind of been ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting up? Fooling?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... affected by drugs or ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But, not like in the US bruh. I mean, here, it&#39;s either you take what&#39;s here or you don&#39;t take nothing at all. And all that, I had a whole buffet of drugs. I wake up in the morning. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Pop a couple of pills and smoke a little something. For lunch I would have something, a whole difference. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Like nah, bro. I almost lost my life when I was 19. I overdosed in the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you were 19?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Before I got deported. OD. It&#39;s crazy because my homeboy was the one overdosing, and I took him to the spot. They took care of him. And next thing you know I was right here doing more drugs ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hospital?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah. At the spot. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. We had the spot. I couldn&#39;t take care of him. We were cheesed out. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. We were o</span><span class="c6">ff</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;that heroin. We mixed it with Xanax. So, I mean, it was an explosion of happiness. And uh, he fell asleep on me. You can&#39;t fall asleep on that, or it&#39;s a deep sleep. And, um, I took him. &quot;Hey man, throw that nigga in a cold shower, throw some ice on his ass and give him about a gallon, two gallons of milk. Y&#39;all pick him up because I can&#39;t take him.&quot; I could barely&hellip;you know what I&rsquo;m saying.... and I would have signs, like I would vomit blood and shit like that. I didn&#39;t care though. As long as I was high, I wasn&#39;t tripping. I was mixing all kinds of drugs. Something like, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you said you had ended up in jail here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you end up in jail here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, it&#39;s crazy. I was drunk. And I would get drunk in my little ranch, in my little hood. Cops wouldn&#39;t even pass by because if they did, they couldn&#39;t even get in. So, I&#39;m like, I thought the whole city was mine. But, I was going to work and I fell asleep on the bus. I was out, drunk. Had a pipe on me, a little meth pipe. And uh when they picked me up they were like, oh yeah, because the guy from the bus woke me up. He&#39;s like, &quot;You got to go.&quot; And I didn&#39;t know where I was at, dog. And he was looking at me funny. I was like, &quot;What nigga?&quot; I tried to fight him. And then he was like, &quot;Nah, the police are going to come for you.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll dip fool.&quot; When I dip, I was going to run. I didn&#39;t know where I was at. I was like, &quot;Fuck, where am I at? How do I exit?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I remember I was at this location and the police pull over. &quot;Y&#39;all ain&#39;t see nobody that&#39;s not from around here?&quot; And the guy points at me. He betrayed me, literally. I got arrested for public intoxication. Man, dog, I remember people crawling, climbing on the walls. The police were not doing anything. Another person was over there beat up. Everybody was in, nobody eating. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. That shit was musty. Everybody was musty. I&#39;m like, damn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were in there, they didn&#39;t give you ... for how long were you in there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For three days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn&#39;t give you any food or water during that time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah dog. I mean, they gave me a little chocolate cup, but I mean, that was ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chocolate cup?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. A little cup of chocolate milk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. On the second day. And that&#39;s because the little homeboy asked them for one. Or, whenever people would come in, if their folks brought them any food, they&#39;ll share the love. It&#39;s all love. But, nah, other than that, nah. If your relatives don&#39;t bring you no food, you&#39;re not eating. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Or, if somebody offers you a little food, you got a done deal. But, other than that, no man. They don&#39;t feed you here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that was the only time you got in jail here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. In my hometown and here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also got in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, these police fucked up. I was going to do seven years, but I can&#39;t really speak up on that, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, because it&#39;s still an open case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you said it&#39;s still open ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s still open. I can&#39;t speak up on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, now, what do you think, is there anything that you would do differently, or are you doing anything differently now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, it&#39;s not much bro. Not much of a difference. I mean, people try to help me out. They taking me to triple A, double A, what&#39;s that shit called? People tell me, you want to go to rehab. People told me; people have really tried to help me. And, I&#39;ll tell you dog, it&#39;s kind of hard to change your lifestyle when you&#39;ve been doing this since you was young. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. It&#39;s hard. I&#39;m talking about pre-K. Kindergarten. I was always into something. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I can&#39;t live a normal life like John Doe. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. You know John Doe, nobody knows him, but other than he&#39;s a person on a piece of paper. John Doe. I can&#39;t be no John Doe, bruh. I can&#39;t go to no nine to five, eat, sleep, shit, wake up and smile every day because it&#39;s a sunny day. Nah bruh. I&#39;m always into something. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Drama. Surrounded by it. Or my life and shit like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried though. I&#39;ve tried because shit man, I&#39;m getting old. I&#39;m getting old, and I mean, who&#39;s going to look after me when I keep fucking up? My parents aren&#39;t. Random people are going to get tired of supporting me. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Trying to help me. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. It&#39;s going to come a day when everybody says, &quot;You know what? Fuck it. You want to be a fucking whatever you want to be? Fuck it. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Burn your bridges.&quot; But yeah man, I&#39;ve tried. I mean, look, see my hair right now? I didn&#39;t comb it because I barely woke up. But, I mean, I used to normally get that bald fade. I went bald, look all fucking funny. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Right now, I would&#39;ve been high. So, it&#39;s little details. Very little details, little baby steps. I look like I&#39;m crawling, You know what I&rsquo;m saying. learning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you&#39;re working on your ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been working on it for the past three, four years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made you want to?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess after my grandpa passed away. Man, I started hearing shit, seeing shit. I&#39;m like, nah man, it&#39;s crazy. I&#39;m like, &quot;What?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Are you dead serious?&quot; You know what I&rsquo;m saying. I felt, after he passed away, I felt by myself. Like, damn. What the fuck am I going to do when I lose everybody? That&#39;s what made me point of becoming crazy. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Losing my mind. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Getting stuck on the plain. That&#39;s what made me want to change. Them certain events led to all this. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you went back, would you do anything differently?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, I&#39;ll tell you what. I&#39;m weak, bro. I&#39;m weak. I&#39;m a weak person, bro. I think if I go back I&#39;m going to go back to the same thing. Like I tell you, when you&#39;re in a respected certain place, the respect is going to be there. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. &nbsp;Or fear. Someone always told me it&#39;s not respect. They fear you. I&#39;m like, shit, I don&#39;t have no fear about it. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. They call me Big Pollo for two reasons dog. I was big and friendly. I would see you, like literally, if I see you, &quot;What&#39;s up bro? What&#39;s good?&quot; But hey man, I don&#39;t want no problems dog. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. &nbsp;But, if you push me to a certain limit man, you&#39;ll end up on the floor bleeding. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. Because I get violent real quick. Man, I don&#39;t have to be mad to fight. Just for the simple fact that I like throwing hands. I do this for fun. It&#39;s a hobby to me. But it comes to a certain point where, you know what I&rsquo;m saying, if you may cause me to get angry or you know what I&rsquo;m saying. I&#39;m going to do what I have to do. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why do you think it was easy for you to get involved so heavy back in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was it so easy for me to get involved? Tell you for the same reason now. I was never that kind of a person that you would step on or make fun of. Fuck that. You&#39;re going to respect me. As I say that part of me not folding, standing my ground. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. That&#39;s what got me involved. Because, people see that, &quot;What&#39;s up bruh? Come sit with us. We got this going on. What&#39;s up? Help us with it.&quot; &quot;Yeah, I got you.&quot; I mean, the simple fact of me fighting, it was fun. The people saw that. You know what I&rsquo;m saying. The people&hellip; I put fear in some places and the people see that. &quot;Let&#39;s do this. Let&#39;s do that.&quot; The simple fact of me being involved, my name would be heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people know me. I don&#39;t know a lot of people, but people are like, &quot;Man everybody knows you.&quot; &quot;I just know but three people.&quot; &quot;But everybody knew you. They know who you are. They seen you. They seen your fights. You don&#39;t know how to fight, but they seen your fights.&quot; Because of that. You know what I&rsquo;m saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you feel like it ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bravery has something to do with it or something, I&#39;m guessing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel more American than you feel Mexican?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jairo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, it&#39;s like, I was in the States.

Like, we&rsquo;re like, where the fuck I&#39;m from then? Cause I&rsquo;m not. It&#39;s hard to be Mexican that grow up in the United States, because right here they&#39;ll call you a &ldquo;pocho.&rdquo; I don&#39;t know what the fuck these niggas be calling us. But, they&#39;d be like, &quot;Nah, you ain&#39;t Mexican. You&#39;re American.&quot; And Americans say, &quot;Nah, you&#39;re not American.
