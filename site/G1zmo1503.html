And I got detained until I was like in the Texas area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so when you crossed the border, where did you go?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight over here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To... No, no-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, to Anaheim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was 1999. Right there in Anaheim.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you stayed with your family?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I stayed with my family and some uncles, and my mom would work in Mision Viejo, C</span><span>alifornia</span><span class="c0">, as a maid, housemaid, and babysitter. And basically, I grew up in the _Anaheim area. I studied in _________ (neighborhood), and then I moved out _____ Street, right there in ________ (neighborhood).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you remember school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I do. I do remember school. It was pretty cool. I mean, I had a lot of childhood friends in the neighborhood. And I had some other issues. Well, not issues, but other decisions and other ways, and I moved out. You know? Chose a different route.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember any specific teachers in school that you really liked?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do. I can say I had a pretty awesome history teacher. I had a cool wood shop teacher&hellip; even though he was always out there pushing his students. I mean, I still remember a lot. You know? I had a good time when I grew up out there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any really good stories or memories from any of these teachers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camping. Well, science camping. That was provided to the sixth grade throughout that time. Pretty cool trip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you do on that trip?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learned how the outdoors worked, like how you... When you see like a snake or a bear or whatever. Or how to come into an act or a play with a group and perform a play in the stage. We met a lot of personalities, a lot of people. It was cool, man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you like acting?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, I liked doing it, but I never got like </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">into it into it,</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;but I never minded. I liked acting, but you know, it is what it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what were your friends like in school? Did you have a big group of friends? Were they mostly from Mexico? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were from many different places. Puerto Rico. I met a lot of people from Florida, Texas, Mexico, Honduras. I mean, I met a lot of people, man. But it&#39;s cool because I like meeting different stages of mind. Not mind of how I would judge a person, but you know how I would, you know, communicate and relate in between... You know, like right now, me and you are conversating and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you have any jobs in the US? Or...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. I was a dishwasher, a busboy, and a janitor in big buildings like those. I would just bag out the trash, and I&#39;d do things like that. A busboy, and private security, man</span><span>, f</span><span class="c0">or one party in Austin. Those kids went heavy [chuckles], but it was cool. I mean, it was them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you ever get into any trouble with the law in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but it was just for not stopping, you know</span><span>. F</span><span class="c0">or resisting arrest. Or misdemeanors. That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you ever involved in any gangs or anything?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the southern, yeah</span><span>, i</span><span class="c0">n the southern area, I was. I had a lot of friends that were involved in gang-related things. But that&#39;s cool. Or I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s like how a person sees it, you know? Or how you see it or how you relate to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you were a little involved in gangs, did you feel like you had a choice to join or not to join or whatever?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, it was something that I liked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it just kind of happen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, just happened. But I mean, you learn from your mistakes. I have. I still will. And if I can fix them, I will. But it&#39;s something that I chose, and there&#39;s no one that can catch up to me, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you think it was a mistake?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, it wasn&#39;t a mistake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t think it was a mistake? You have no mistakes?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mistakes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No regrets?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plenty of mistakes, but mistakes that had already occurred</span><span>. T</span><span class="c0">he only way I can think of that mistake is that, hey, maybe I won&#39;t make the same mistake next time. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re learning from...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So learning from my mistakes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how long were you working in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my teenage years, like when we were actually valid to work. I think it was 16 and up. No, 16 you still needed a permission slip or something like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I worked from 16 and up, man. And right now I&#39;m 24, and I&rsquo;ve still been working. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so how did you end up back in Mexico? Can you tell me a little bit about what happened? Did you come back voluntarily or were you detained and deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got deported.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I tried to fight my case, but I was still denied. And I was removed out of that complex on the 12</span><span class="c3 c10">th</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of April, 2015. And I was dropped off in Laredo. Puente 1, or how would you say it in English? Like the cross border something?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the bridge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridge, yeah. Bridge number one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you were deported, and then you came back straight to Mexico City? Or did you stop in Tijuana?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I was straight back. It was like 18 hours, 17 hours in a bus that was driven out like at three in the midnight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. So you ended up back here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I made it back here, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like coming back to Mexico? Did you speak Spanish?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, I didn&#39;t speak it. I do speak Spanish, and I&#39;ve always spoken Spanish, but on the way back, it was just like a moment of silence. You know, a moment where you just stay quiet and all in your mind is where you&#39;re thinking about people who you&#39;re leaving behind and like, &quot;Damn</span><span>.</span><span class="c3">&quot; </span><span>Y</span><span class="c0">ou know? But it&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so what did you do when you got back to Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I stayed with my father for a couple of months. We didn&#39;t really relate to each other, bumped heads. But he&#39;s old, so he likes being alone, and I can understand that. My brother tried to help me out too, but I started learning how to be here and I started moving apart. Once I learn, I do it myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is some of your family still in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, just my mom, my daughter, and that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a daughter there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother</span><span>...</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>T</span><span class="c0">wo brothers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they have their papers or no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they do. Yeah, they&#39;re citizens. But I don&#39;t bother them, they&#39;re doing their thing over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you start working in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did it take you to get a job?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within one month. I started in Radisson</span><span>, </span><span class="c3">right there in ______ where the pumas go, as a room service attender. You know, getting coffee orders.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Checking out. Just like something a cashier would do, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s the service I provided within the first year I arrived here in Mexico. And then one of my friends recommended me to TeleTech. I arrived</span><span>. T</span><span class="c3">hroughout the training, I learned it. It was stressful, back to back. And then I moved out to T-Mobile, and T-Mobile is where I was there for like nine months, top 10. But I had some struggles and some issues outside of work that I had to take care of and wouldn&#39;t let me stay 100% focused, but I can say that T-Mobile provided me something pretty good, man. T-Mobile was pretty badass. I liked it. Easy money, and I met a lot of people that were pretty cool.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Other than that, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve been doing here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you still work at a call center, or no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at the moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you doing anything now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#39;m looking forward to working. I&#39;m also looking into what studies I want to study when I sign up, because I guess the other</span><span>&hellip;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>S</span><span class="c0">tarting from first semester still next year, so I got all this ending part of the year to think about what I want to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem like you had a lot of teachers that you liked in the States, and so did you like school a lot? And is that why you&#39;re looking to go back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I did. I did enjoy school, man. I&#39;ve always enjoyed school. But I learned what I learned, and from what I learned, I can say I can do good here. I mean, I&#39;ll go back when I&#39;m ready. I&#39;ll go back. I&#39;m still going to go back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is there anything you miss about the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man, the women. The women and the beach. The palm trees.

A</span><span class="c0">re there any that you miss?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>I</span><span class="c0">n-N-Out Burger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-N-Out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. [inaudible 00:12:15]. John&#39;s Pizza. China King. What else? In-N-Out Burger. Short Stop</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you get burgers like In-N-Out here? Or no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah. You can, but you always notice the taste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s different?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different. At times, depending on where you&#39;re eating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And do you miss the weather in the States too? Or? Because I know LA has some nice weather. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do. The weather over there is bonfires every night, like in</span><span>&nbsp;Laguna Beach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here it&#39;s...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s places. I mean, I&#39;ve only been here three years, but I&#39;ve been checking out a lot of places that you can have a good time. And trust me, when I get back up on my feet, I like to party. I&#39;m single right now, so ain&#39;t nobody, you know, telling me what to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So since you&#39;ve been back in Mexico, have people treated you differently because they knew you were from America maybe, or spent time in the States and had some tattoos too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in a way, yeah, because sometimes they... I&#39;m used to speaking both, but I do speak English with certain people, and other people that might be next to us, don&#39;t</span><span>-</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;speak Spanish, they always think we&#39;re always talking negative, but it&#39;s not always that case, you know? I mean, I&#39;m not even... I mean if somebody&#39;s fighting down there and if it&#39;s my hom</span><span>ie</span><span class="c3">, I&#39;ll probably go downstairs. But if I know that it&#39;s not my hom</span><span>ie</span><span class="c0">, like damn, it&#39;s just some cops giving out a ticket or something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you trust police in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they&#39;re pretty trained, man. And, I mean, I already paid my crime. They caught me about four times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did you trust what they were doing? And did you think they were fair?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They were fair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, they were assholes, but over here, they&#39;re more pigs, man. For real.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>I</span><span class="c0">s there anything that you don&#39;t miss about the United States? Anything that you just didn&#39;t like at all when you were over there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, I like it all. The US is pretty cool. For real.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are you planning on going back someday maybe?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After&hellip; I mean, I want to go back, right? But if I have to go through a desert, I&#39;m just going to go dirt biking and come back.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Nah, I&#39;m just playing. But yeah, I would like to go back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you do go back, would you try to get a visa or do you think you&#39;d just cross the border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll try to get a visa or something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you cross the border if there was no other option? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I would, but just for fun. But nah, I mean, I want to do it right, but... Yeah, I don&#39;t know what I will do, man, but I know I&#39;ll go back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>D</span><span class="c0">o you feel more American or more Mexican?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I&#39;m Mexican, man. But I got that American in me because I was raised over there. I won&#39;t criticize or judge. Shit, I mean, it&#39;s all out. Anybody can fight, you just got to... Damn, you know? Wait till your temperature goes like this, and trust me, you&#39;ll go like, &quot;Pow.&quot; It&#39;s fun too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you think that the United States shaped who you are today? Like, do you have any qualities that you think are more American than Mexican?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, why not? Why not, you know? Because the way I grew up, the education that was provided to me within the </span><span>________</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Schools District area, with their teaching skills and the way they taught me. I mean, I went to school over there, man, and trust me, I haven&#39;t forgotten what I learned, because I ain&#39;t dumb. But it&#39;s just sometimes you&#39;re involved in situations that, damn, you know, </span><span>like, </span><span class="c0">fuck. Like that motherfucker is hard, but damn, we met again and bang, bang, bang. Or you get hit with a test or something you&#39;d like to learn about, you get into it. And I can say that my skill study at that point of view is pretty good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything you would change about your time in the United States? Is there anything you wish you&#39;d done differently?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, I&#39;m good. I graduated from _________ High School</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[Famous celebrity] went to that school. Have a lot of veterans that went to that school from the Vietnam War, World War One. That&#39;s pretty cool. Pretty cool teachers..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did he do that was funny?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can say he didn&#39;t give a damn, you know? Like I fell asleep and he wouldn&#39;t even bother me. [Laughs]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Y</span><span class="c0">ou said that you&#39;re thinking about going back to school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you want to study?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About cars. I want to study cars, and that&#39;s it. Electricity too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel at home in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times. I like moving into areas where I can picture, you know, the US, and it keeps me in some sort of comfort. Calm, you know? I&#39;m used to the violence. I mean I like action</span><span>. I&rsquo;m </span><span class="c0">active. You know? I&#39;m active. Like in a sport way, you know? [Chuckles]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you try to seek out places that kind of just remind you of the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I like camping as well, and over there, I&#39;ve been to Isabella Lake, Big Bear, San Bernardino, and damn. I learned how to fish with Mr. Don or something like that and his best friend. Caught like six fish or something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tim:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you gone fishing since you&#39;ve been back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">G1zmo 1503:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, I haven&#39;t. I&#39;ve just been having a good time, you know? But trust me, I love women, man, and it&#39;s like damn, ladies over here, but [inaudible 00:19:28]. But yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c3 c8"></span></p></body></html>
