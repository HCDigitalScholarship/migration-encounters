Why did you migrate?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my mom, she left first. We stayed here like for six years without mom. She was just saving money, call us - send the property stuff, you know, like what we need. But after six years, mom decides to bring us to the United States. When she left, I was six years old, and my brother five years old.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you didn&#39;t see your mother for how many years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was too long. It was hard because she was mom and dad at the same time, and I always had my grandmother take care of us. Well, the first of all, it was just living with my dad. But Dad, he was never at home. He was working all the time. After that I just take care of my brother. I wouldn&#39;t have any time for myself. It was take care of him, school, homework, all of that, telling Mom how I was doing, how I was feeling. After those, I just remember that I moved into my other grandma&#39;s house, my mother&#39;s mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just decide to live there. We had no good experience without mama home because it was not the same thing. With family looking at you, not in a bad mood, but like, &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have the mom. You don&#39;t have nobody to take care of you.&quot; You know, tell them some stuff to make you feel down. We just going through all that stuff. Domestic violence and all that. After six years, Mom decide to bring us with her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were sort of a mother to your younger brother, as a very small girl?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I never have time for playing with other kids because I was always at home, taking care of my brother. He was sick. One time, he&#39;s opened his head because he was playing, and I was like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; One time, a long time ago, when we just go to after school&mdash;where the teacher help us on homework and learning more stuff that we don&#39;t understand in school. So one day, my brother he just walk out the door and I was with the teacher, talking, and we just hear like a car accident. It was my brother. They take him to the hospital. It was a lot of things because mom my was not over there. She was not here for us, for helping us, for telling at those moments how we feel. Like if somebody do something to us, or if somebody touching us, or something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did that happen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it would happen with the family. We never say anything because we don&#39;t know who we are speaking to, who you are talking to, or only hear bad treatments, bad words, mentality, all of those things. But after that, when we just decide to move on with my mom, we leave my grandma here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were sexually abused as a child?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. And domestic violence too. It was not easy, but we just growing up with that mentality, that everything was normal and everything was okay. Because we don&#39;t have no one to tell you, &quot;Hey, this is wrong,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey, when you&#39;re growing up, you will have a [inaudible] &nbsp;woman feeling to give you a hug,&rdquo; or how to love. How do you love yourself? How do you love someone? We don&#39;t know nothing about that. We never know or expected those things because we never growing up with love.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were completely abandoned?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I&#39;m not going to say that, but I think it is probably Mom move on and leave because she&#39;s try to give us a better life. But when we&#39;re just growing up, all those six years, like you&#39;re growing up with a mentality like, &quot;Why Mom or Daddy was not there when somebody discriminate you or tell you something that will make you feel bad, or some stuff like that?&quot; When we there, I was just hating life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, when I was having argument with my mom because I was like, &quot;You never be there when it was Mother&#39;s Day, you was not there. When it was my birthday, you was not there. You send money, you send clothes, you send this and that, but the important thing, it was not in there. Did you ever talk to us, &lsquo;How do you feeling, what do you think, do you like her, is somebody&#39;s going to do something to you? Or what&#39;s going on?&rsquo; You never be there.&rdquo; But here, me and my brother to tell you, &ldquo;Mom we&#39;re feeling like this, we have something, or somebody do something to us, like we never have you there.&quot; So that&#39;s when our parents separated, or moms left, or we&#39;re left, feel completely like themselves. So it was, it was a little bit hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot hard, I bet. How old were you went to join your mother?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around, I don&#39;t know, maybe one night when I saw my mother after six years&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you went to the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 9.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine. And did you just cross the border or did you&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was across the border.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that easy? What happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was cross the border, it was me, my brother, and my cousin. I just remember the first time, we just tried to jump. It was really tall. I was feeling that I was probably fell down and broken arm or my hair or some stuff. We just met the coyotes and they help us to jump to the other side and they was telling us to run like out to nowhere. We don&#39;t even have nobody. We never know where&#39;s the other place to run or to get cover from the Immigration around there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, we don&#39;t walk for long. But we just decide to come back because they left us in the middle of the nowhere. And we&#39;re just like, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; I remember my cousin Javier, he would say, &quot;We have to come back. We&#39;re not too far away now.&quot; Like, &quot;How? We don&#39;t even know here. We don&#39;t know around, how are we gonna come back, these people leave us here.&quot; And like, &quot;Well I do see where we&#39;re walking, so just . . . so everything is going to be okay. Let&#39;s try to come back, because if we continue walking and walking, we don&#39;t know where we are, it&#39;s going to be more difficult.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just decide to back and try to jump, like helping each other because who is going to catch us on the other side? He said &quot;Let me jump first, and you guys going to jump later.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; So we just helping each other. He jumped first, like to cross the border again, and we just like jumping and cross again and we just walked back to the hotel and we just wait two or three days. Because we talk to the coyote man and I just hear my cousin, he say, &quot;Those people leave us in the middle of the nowhere.&quot; And they say, &quot;Well why you guys come back? And they don&#39;t catch you, they don&#39;t get you, and none of that.&rdquo; And I was like thank you. And we just decide to come back and we was in the hotel, he said, &quot;You guys take a rest,&rdquo; they bring us food, and they like, &quot;We going to try again.&quot; He said, &quot;It&#39;s going to be a little bit different.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, we just decide to walking. They leave us with the people, we just jumping in the car, and it was in the night, in the middle of the road. They say, &quot;We cross like two roads, three&quot;&mdash;I don&#39;t really remember. And they say, &quot;You guys going to get out of the car, we&#39;re going to turn off the lights of the car, and you just have to run.&quot; And we was with other man, he was a young, young guy&mdash;he&#39;s probably like 20, 27, 20. He&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m the one, I&#39;m going to take care of this tonight.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just like dressing up and everything and we just start walking, walking, and walking. It was in the night, we were just looking around because we don&#39;t see nothing, it&#39;s no lights, none of that. I was like, &quot;Oh my God, probably animals or snakes or something like that, we don&#39;t see anything.&quot; And he say, &quot;It&#39;s okay, I know where we going. Soon as we get there, everything&#39;s going to be okay. Everything&#39;s going to be fine.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just remember, we just walking, walking, and we just take a little break and the guy, he was just walking around to check if see if there was not Immigration around and we just continue. We just take a long while. Like a whole night, we get there like the next day before some stars, you know shining in the morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just remember, he, the coyote man went, &quot;We have to run as fast as we can. Don&#39;t look and turn back because we&#39;re going to pass outside of a jail.&quot; And we&#39;re just like, &quot;What? How are we going to do that?&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, we just have to walk.&quot; My brother gave the hand to my cousin, and I give the hand to this coyote. He&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to take care of you and you have to run as fast as you can. Don&#39;t lose me. Don&#39;t move your hand or my hand, we just have to stay each other, but we have to run.&quot; He was just like, &quot;Don&#39;t look around or something because they have cameras.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He say, &quot;Are you guys ready?&quot; We was like, &quot;Yeah, I guess.&quot; And we just started running. I just remember, I don&#39;t turn my face nowhere, I don&#39;t looking back, I just looking forward. Finish to cross the jail we just got around from the jail. &nbsp;So we just do that, he just make a phone call, we were already there. It was really hard because it was a lot of rocks and just running. I was having in that moment in my mind, like, &quot;What going to be happen if the police officers or somebody from jail see us running us outside. Like shooting us or something because sometimes it happens. They don&#39;t care.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that day, we just make it. And they picking up us. They take us to a trailer park, and they let us take a shower, they give us food, and we were just tired because we were just walking and like no sleep, none of that. After we get there, they call my mom and say, &quot;Meet us right here. Your kids they cross.&rdquo; It was in Texas. So, they bring a truck with bunches of people to go to different states to Texas, to the south and north. So they take us, we take a long trip, almost like four or five days after that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the truck?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the truck with people. They say if they stop us, we have to say we just come from work from another state, with the agriculture people, like picking tomatoes or cranberries or some stuff like that. And just tell them that this lady is your mom, some stuff because we was like, me and my brother and another kid, was little. Like they say something like, &ldquo;Well you come too many,&rdquo; you just tell them that, like don&#39;t say anything else. I was like, &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; But they don&#39;t treat us bad, there was nice people. Soon as we finish to the trip with the rest of the people, we just, we just saw mom after long, a few years, like six seven years almost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well the first interaction was like, &quot;Well finally we&#39;re with you.&quot; We were just asking questions at the same time, &quot;Why do you leave us? Why you take too long for bring us? Why?&quot; You know, it&#39;s too many questions. It&#39;s just like, &quot;Do you think we want to be work here? Like we don&#39;t speak English, how we&#39;re going to talk, how we&#39;re going to say something?&rdquo; She say, &quot;You guys going to be at school, you going to be have the teachers, they going to be teach you, don&#39;t worry, everything&#39;s going to be okay.&quot; And when we get home with Mom, I was just remember that my mom that she never told us that she was to have a baby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never say nothing. No mention, none of this. And we&#39;re like, why we just get home, we see just my little brother, it was like, &quot;Who&#39;s that baby?&quot; She was like, &quot;It&#39;s your brother.&quot; We&#39;re like, &quot;What do you mean it&#39;s my brother?&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, I was have another son. I don&#39;t guys tell you because you are going to probably feel jealous or this and that.&quot; In that moment, in my mind, I was like, &quot;Well my mom she forget us for long because of the baby,&rdquo; and you know, like not negative stuff, but we just like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; We just see her, she was living with somebody, and she have my brother, and I was like, &ldquo;That&#39;s not going to be happening.&rdquo; That almost broke my heart because I still have that mentality Mom and Dad come back one day. But I was like, &quot;Mm-mm [Negative sound], I&#39;m 29, just like 29 years they not together anymore.&quot; So, it was like, &quot;Uh oh.&quot; And I was sort of like, I was with bad mood with mom, or she was telling me something like, &quot;You have attitude,&quot; or something like that. I was like, &quot;Because it&#39;s a lot of things. You don&#39;t talk to us, you don&#39;t tell us the truth.&quot; I was feeling that mom was bringing us to United States with lies. Everything&#39;s going to be okay, but she never talk about she was having with somebody, she was having another baby, none of that. That was a big surprise for us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I imagine. Let me just ask you a few questions, going back. You said that when you crossed the border, you jumped. What did you jump over?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like, some of this material.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like barbed wire?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the barbed wire, yeah, but to the top. But we just like helping each other with the hands, like holding one person on the bottom and somebody holding you, and the other one, was on the other side to try to catch you in case you slip or just don&#39;t catch yourself well. So, you have someone else on the other side to help bring you, to wait, or carry you. Because it was really tall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really tall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really tall. And I was like, &quot;Oh my God, probably not make it.&quot; I was scared because it was too much for jump and one person before you jump and other person on the other side, it was like, &quot;Do you think you can jump this?&quot; Like, &quot;I don&#39;t know, like you need to show us.&quot; Because we don&#39;t know. And they say, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re kids, you won&rsquo;t probably make it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You won&#39;t probably make it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like, &ldquo;Well it depends.&rdquo; And I just remember they like have a person this side and the other person on the other side. They always make my cousin Javier, to get him first and us later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old was your cousin?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin, right now, I think he is 35.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, but at the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, he was young, he was like 28.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was much older than you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.

And they say, &quot;You can drink water from there.&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I&#39;m not going to drink water from there.&quot; We never know what the water have, if they have some contaminents or something because that&#39;s for animals. We&#39;re looking it, the smell, and all that, and I was like, &quot;No, I&#39;m not going to drink nothing.&quot; I&#39;m like it don&#39;t matter if I&#39;m really thirsty, but I&#39;m going to wait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we was walking, this coyote, he was having light on his hand, I remember I see gallons of water, we just get some water from there&mdash;well we just see one and a half. It&#39;s like, &quot;You can drink that water because people they leave stuff here.&quot; They can&rsquo;t carry a lot of things, where you see jackets, clothes, those waters were empty ones, or some stuff like that, shoes. I know I was like, &quot;Oh my God, why we see this?&quot; We was thinking like probably somebody left clothes here, probably they kill somebody or they [inaudible] someone, and leave the clothes here and take him away. But we just continue walking with less light up, we can&#39;t able to see anything around because it was dark, it was night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you went to school in the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s where you learned your English?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I just started over everything again in middle school because mom says it doesn&#39;t count, the school they did here.

I was just talk to my mom one day about it, I&#39;m like, &quot;You know what, I don&#39;t want to go to school no more. I want to help you, because I see every time you get mad or some stuff like because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on.&quot; She was like, &quot;It&#39;s because I pay everything and I take care of you and this and that.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Well I&#39;m not going to go to school no more, I will be help you. Just like you work, pay the rent, and I pay the bills.&quot; And that&#39;s how I that learn how to take care, house working, how you have to take care of yourself, how you can buy a pair of shoes, how you can take care of for your own self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So basically you became the house mom, and your mother went to work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get it.

Well, it&#39;s my brother because he&#39;s from a different dad, but the same thing as my brother, my half-brother. But I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; He was little. I used to get him, when we just get with my mom, when he was little, that&#39;s how I learn how to make a bottle, put the baby in the shower, do all those things that I made with my older brother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you did it, the same thing you did in Mexico, you did again in the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the States and I was like, &quot;Oh my God, why did I have to take care of all this too?&quot; I get up in the morning, Mom says, &quot;Hey I&#39;m leaving to work. I have to work on the weekends too because I want to give you guys a better life and this and that.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Yes Mom, but it&#39;s too much. You leave and you leave me with the baby.

But what do I do with the baby?&quot; And like, &quot;Look. Just fill it up the bottle, this is the size. And behind the milk, the formula, it teaches you, it shows you instructions, how you make your bottle.&quot; I was like, &quot;Oh my God, I have to babysit my brother? You don&#39;t pay a lady for she can take care of him?&quot; And she was like laughing like, &quot;You want to be one?&quot; And I was always taking care of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. So who did you live with when you were in the United States? You lived with your parents? Your mom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your siblings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother, and the baby, my baby brother, and her husband.

But mostly not really because we just like always with homework, helping mom to do things at the house. She was like, &quot;You have learn how to cook, how to be in the kitchen, you have to do this, you have to.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;When will it going to be time for me? Always cooking, cleaning, no! I want to have my own time.&quot; But we just mostly that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why did you leave the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I leave the United States? I was there for a long time. But, I was going to Atlanta, Georgia. I don&#39;t have no drivers license. I was driving to come back to North Carolina. I was speeding. </span><span class="c8">One of the police officer stop me, ask me for the license and things from the car, and they say, &quot;I just go and check.&quot; He just goes&mdash;I don&#39;t remember if he was DEA or somebody&mdash;&quot;They need to check your car. I&#39;m not saying that you bring something or that you have something or drugs or stuff like that, but they need to check the car.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? Like I don&#39;t have nothing, where are you coming from?&quot; I was like, &quot;If you see, I have the GPS, I come for the people, they come from work to pick up watermelons. I have a lot of watermelons in the trunk, I&#39;m going to take care of this for people that I know. I just come and say &lsquo;Hey&rsquo; to them, just go back and forth, that&#39;s it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, but you was speeding.&quot; I like, &quot;Yes, sir, I understand but I have to come back because I have my kids waiting for me. I have a baby waiting for me. That was probably speeding, right? And the car is for a rental car service, so I have to bring up before this time and it&#39;s already late.&quot; Other people come, they check the car, open the trunk, my stuff, and they was checking in my phone where I was coming from.

It&#39;s going to be taking long.&quot; And they, &quot;No, probably have to wait and don&#39;t worry.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; As soon as I get in there, like they check my name and all that, and it was like, &quot;You have to give us your cell phone and your wallet&quot; And I was like, &quot;Why? He said they&#39;re not going to take my wallet away and all my phone, how did I am going to communicate with the family?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, you cannot do that.

What are they going to do?&quot; &quot;Oh, they take it to, to where all those cars going, where people they have no license.&quot; I just remember that officer was a little bit rude. It&#39;s like, &quot;Well, don&#39;t say anything else. If we don&#39;t ask anything, you don&#39;t talk.&quot; Like, &quot;Okay.&quot; I was waiting, I was calling someone, nobody answers the phone. I ask them, &quot;Can I try it on my phone because I need to communicate, I need to tell them it&rsquo;s me calling, they have to answer the phone.&quot; And they were like, &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s fine.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Okay, I just trying to find someone.&quot; &quot;But don&#39;t answer the phone, don&#39;t answer no messages.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was like texting someone, tell them what was going on. And the police officer he was getting really rude. Like, &quot;I told you don&#39;t give her phone again if she asking for the phone. Don&#39;t give it to her.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I was telling them what happened, they don&#39;t know, I just want them to know. Like if you let me give them a call, it&#39;s not going to be more than a minute.&quot; And so, I just do that, and after that I call, then they say they want to see the way, how they can make it there. I just remember quickly taking a picture from the place and I just put the location. I just send them. I was like, &quot;This is the location where I am located at. This is my full name, just come and see what&#39;s going on because they don&#39;t let me know nothing about it. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to be happen. They say they had to pay my tickets before anytime, or some stuff like that, before they dress me up and take me to the rest of the people.&rdquo; &quot;Okay.&quot; But you see, like they say it several times about letting me go and let me leave, and after that I just remember the police officers says, &quot;Hey so someone&#39;s going to talk to you on the phone.&quot; I was like, &quot;Who?&quot; They&#39;re like, &quot;Just answer the phone.&quot; And I just remember I was say &quot;Yes. Who did I speaking?&quot; It was like, &quot;What&#39;s your full name?&quot; I say my full name, &quot;______ It was like, &quot;Well do you know who you&#39;re speaking to?&quot; &quot;No, I don&#39;t&quot; They was like, &quot;Well, are you in United States of the America, are you a citizen?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, &quot;Do I have to answer you these questions?&quot; They&#39;re like, &quot;Well I&#39;m just asking you.&quot; Like, &quot;Well I&#39;m just asking you too. Do I have to answer this questions? I don&#39;t have to answer you any of this if I don&#39;t talk to a lawyer, to an attorney.&quot; That person I always remember he was mad. He was like, &quot;Well don&#39;t answer, but I will go see like face to face.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Give the phone to the person, the attorney,&rdquo; to speak to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I don&#39;t know what he tells to the police officer.

We tried to talk to one and the lawyer, I just remember, she says like, &quot;Too much going on&rdquo; to do something for me to see if I can be able to stay or qualify for more because I always have more than 10 years. I think when they have more than 10 years, they can qualify for, see if they can stay there. There can be permissions or visa or some stuff like that. It was going for a lot. They&#39;re like, &quot;You have to show and now prove that you this that and that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&#39;ve done nothing wrong.

My own self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to see if I can wait or see if I can talk to a lawyer or see if he can do something for my case or my situation, right? Because I&#39;m not doing nothing terrible to just be here. Just because we&#39;re illegal. Like someone, they do, sometimes they do. You know they&#39;re not like doing good over there, then they do a lot of mistakes. Everybody making mistakes, but like me, just for no license and for some simple things because we are little but different. You can hear different stories</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, this is nothing. You&#39;ve done nothing. So if you returned it would be to be with your children?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that&#39;s the only reason that I want to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it&#39;s the only reason you would return.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s terrible. I&#39;m so sorry. That&#39;s horrible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. Is there anything else you want to say before we end?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope they can see what the real situation with like people like us. It&#39;s not right to separate families. Because right here it is a little bit more comfortable with cultures, abuses, a lot of, got a lot of things going on here. I love Mexico, I was happy and glad to see all the rest of my family but the only thing I just ask for to try to come back and see my kids again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s too hard to say this, but in one word, just in one sentence, why is it so horrible to separate families? </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c8">Lucero:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don&#39;t know why they do that or why they do this, but the only thing I can say, it&#39;s just not right. Kids, they need mom and dad or mom, doing two parents at the same time, mom and dad at the same time. Like my mom. But I don&#39;t have a word to say. I don&#39;t have a word to say, but that&#39;s not right. I hope they can understand how hard it is for a mother to stay away from kids. Because it&#39;s not the same, a mother to create their own kid, for somebody else to create their own kids.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c14 c16"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c13"><tbody><tr class="c18"><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span class="c5"></span></p></td><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c11"><span class="c5"></span></p></div><div class="c10"><p class="c15"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c6">I picked this quote because it speaks to the fact that solidarity and compassion are not always present among those of shared identities.&nbsp; Other Latino students, perhaps native-born, did not treat Lucero with&nbsp;respect or help them learn -- they were assimilated into a culture in which they could treat others poorly when they wanted to learn.</span></p></div><div class="c10"><p class="c15"><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a><span class="c6">I chose this quote because it is evidence of blatant stereotyping and prejudice, but disguised in some positive manner, as the officer tried to say &quot;I&#39;m not saying that you have drugs,&quot; yet insinuating that is exactly the reason why.</span></p></div><div class="c10"><p class="c15"><a href="#cmnt_ref3" id="cmnt3">[c]</a><span class="c6">After hearing other perspectives, I find it so interesting that she did not experience discrimination or issues from the government on Mexico, especially when other were offered little support and lacked solidarity upon returning.</span></p></div><div class="c10"><p class="c15"><a href="#cmnt_ref4" id="cmnt4">[d]</a><span class="c6">This is truly so devastating.&nbsp; No parent should be separated from their children period.&nbsp; It points to a complete lack of compassion on the part of the government to understand that humans are humans and we are all worthy of basic human rights.</span></p></div></body></html>
