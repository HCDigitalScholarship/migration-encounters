I wanted to say that I understand that sometimes retelling these stories and talking about your experiences can be a little painful and can bring about certain emotions that we try to suppress and not really want to think about. I apologize if this is the case and that does happen, but I do think that your story is going to be one that&#39;s going to be very helpful to us, and it&#39;s very important for you to tell it, and for us to hear it, in order to</span><span>, </span><span class="c1">project aside, just in order to be able to try to help people understand and humanize migration in the eyes of those who don&#39;t do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re just going to begin. My first question is, how old were you when you went to the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 21 years old.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21 years old. How did you get </span><span>to the United</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I crossed the border illegally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you talk to me a little bit about the experience crossing the border?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, back then I had just left school because I didn&#39;t have enough money for the books and all that. I just left high school, and I was trying to get onto [inaudible 00:01:10] architecture. It was a real expensive career. I started working, but the guy that I was working with, he wasn&#39;t paying me very good. I was working as a photographer. Then I had a relative in the United States. He was my uncle, my mom&#39;s brother. He was there. My grandmother passed away suddenly. He came for the funeral.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was here, he was talking to me and he&#39;s like, &quot;Why don&#39;t you come back with me?&quot; I didn&#39;t know anything other than what we all know when we are here. It&#39;s illegal to go there, but I didn&#39;t know anything about the laws or about crossing or about anything. Just that it was dangerous and it was something better on the other side. I didn&#39;t have a girlfriend. I wasn&#39;t in school. I didn&#39;t have a good job. He asked me, &quot;Why don&#39;t you come with me?&quot; and I say, &quot;Well, why not?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took a bus to Nuevo Laredo, and then we crossed the border. It took us about five days to get over to the other side. We got lucky because we heard a lot of stories on the same week we were there about at least six people dying. Three of them because of the ranchers shooting at them. Other three because of dehydration on the desert. Finally I made it to Austin. I left Mexico City on February of the 9th, 2014. Sorry, 2004. I made it into Austin in February the 17th. That&#39;s how I made it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me a little bit about that first day? How was it? What impressions did you have? How did it differ from Mexico and all that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weird thing is that once I crossed the border, while we were hiding between the houses and everything, I started to realize how big of a deal that was. I was like, &quot;I am risking my life.&quot; They told me, they kne</span><span>w &mdash; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a lot of people asked me not to go, but I didn&#39;t realize until I was there already. We were hiding &ndash; actually, we saw two patrols from the border for immigration. Then I realized I&#39;m already here. I&#39;m on the other side. These guys, they just started to run because they thought they were going to catch us. They told me to cross one at a time. They told me to cross. When I started crossing the street from one side of the houses to the other side of the street, the cops saw me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped. I looked at my watch or pretended to be looking at my watch. I didn&#39;t have a watch, but pretended to be looking at my watch. Then I just put my hands on one of my hands on my pocket, and I just started walking. Everybody started signaling me and telling me bad words about it. Like, &quot;Hurry up. Come on, come on. Hurry up.&quot; I was just calmly walking. They saw me and they just turned around and left because I did not run. Then I realized, if you act like that, they will be looking for you. Then once we settled and there was like ... how do you call it, when there&#39;s a lot of fruit trees? It&#39;s like a little </span><span class="c2 c14">huert</span><span class="c14">a</span><span>&nbsp;[orchard], </span><span class="c1">something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were there, a song that I haven&#39;t heard in like five years started to play. A song from Mexico started to play in the United States. It&#39;s not a famous song. It&#39;s just a song from a group from the state of Veracruz. I can&#39;t recall the name of the song or the song specifically, but I can recall the group. The group, it&#39;s </span><span class="c2 c14">Los Caracoles</span><span>&nbsp;[The Snails].</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;It&#39;s not very famous, but it was weird there, because it&#39;s not something famous. It&#39;s just famous locally in Veracruz. I have relatives in Veracruz. We spend most of the time inside of a houses or hotels. Then we went to San Antonio, and I didn&#39;t see anything. It was dark. It was night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when I first arrived to Austin, it was at nighttime. We were driving and about to meet my uncle because he crossed first. When we were getting to Austin, the first thing that I saw, on</span><span>e </span><span class="c2">differen</span><span>ce</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is because here at night, you can&#39;t see the lights after, I don&#39;t know, 150, 300 meters. There, when we were working, driving all night, 35, we could see everything. The first thing I noticed was the building. It was the tallest building back then, the Frost Tower. It was the tallest building back then. The shape, the lights, and everything, I fell in love with the city as soon as I saw it. I liked it as soon as I saw it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made you like it the most?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything</span><span>. T</span><span class="c2">he air is clean. The traffic, they call it traffic</span><span>, </span><span class="c2">I call it easy day. They haven&#39;t been in Mexico </span><span>C</span><span class="c1">ity to call it traffic. Everybody&#39;s polite. I didn&#39;t see a lot of racism at first in there. I didn&#39;t see it. I was treated like somebody. The first thing that I have to learn was to say, &quot;I don&#39;t speak English.&quot; The funny thing is, the first time that I was practicing at... while I was cleaning the tables from the restaurant I was working at, I was practicing. &quot;I don&#39;t speak English. I don&#39;t speak English. I don&#39;t speak English.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a customer, I was cleaning a table and a couple of customers, they call me and they say, &quot;Hey, I need blah, blah, blah, blah.&quot; I don&#39;t know what they say. I turn around and I said, so proudly of myself, &quot;I don&#39;t speak Spanish.&quot; The first time I said it, I said it wrong. They would treat me differently because I wouldn&#39;t speak English, but they wouldn&#39;t treat me bad. They wouldn&#39;t be condescending with me. They will be polite and try to be slow to keep up with my pace. I started to learn English by myself. That helped me a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember anybody specifically that had a prolonged impact on you during your time in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not somebody in specific, but a lot of people came to mind, a lot. There&#39;s a lot of people. I can&rsquo;t think only one person that helped me, because there</span><span>&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">a lot of people that I get. Not everybody liked me, of course. I don&#39;t know anybody like that. But most of the people that like me, they didn&#39;t like me, they loved me. They helped me a lot. Anything that I needed something, they were there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your worst experience in the United States and your best experience? Like the part that you liked the leas</span><span>t</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and the part that you liked the most?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my worst experience, let me see. The part that I liked the most, it&#39;s when I went out to do whatever I wanted. Sometimes I was bored at home, and I&#39;ll just go out. Once I was out, I will decide where to go. I didn&#39;t have an idea where I would go. It might be just to the 7/11 around the corner to get something. I might just drive on the truck and think, &quot;I&#39;m going to go to downtown,&quot; and then end up in San Antonio or in Houston. It could be at 3:00 in the morning, on the afternoon, on the weekend. Anytime that I wanted to. I like the freedom that I had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your favorite thing to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a lot of things. I like a lot of things. I like to take pictures. I&#39;d like to go canoeing and kayaking. I like to go running. I don&#39;t run too much, but I like going to run. I like to visit the museums, the </span><span>l</span><span class="c2">ake, the river, trails, all th</span><span>e</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cities. My favorite city to visit was San Antonio. My favorite city to live in was Austin. I really enjoyed my job. When I was working as an electrician, it was the job I enjoyed the most, because I was doing something important. I work in a project that is called St. Austin&#39;s. It&#39;s a Catholic church parking lot. It&#39;s a six story building. I worked from the very beginning of it. We did the underground for the crane, and I put the very last light bulb on the job. I was the foreman on that job. I worked on the offices at Google, when they first moved to Austin from Silicon Valley. I worked in several universities, banks, residences. That&#39;s what I did the last years that I was there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you mentioned that you took class at UT Austin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to get into the school in Austin. They first told me that I have to do my GED. I didn&#39;t know too much of that at the time, but they told me that I could take my GED. I bought the book, and I studied by myself. First they told me that they didn&#39;t have it in Spanish. I concentrate more in English. Then they told me they needed social security numbers and ID, so I just didn&#39;t do it. I left it. But then years later, I learned that you don&#39;t need a social security number to get your GED, but I tried to get onto UT. The only thing available for me was the informal classes. I took informal classes, photography informal classes at UT.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you like them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked them. Most of the things that I knew or that I learned in the last year or so, let&#39;s say from my early 20s until now, pretty much. Most of it was self-taught stuff. I taught myself. One of the things that I did, it was photography. I grabbed the cameras from the store I was working at, and I was playing with them. I would go to the bookstore, look at the books, and put them back in. I wouldn&#39;t even buy them. I&#39;d just play with the camera. I finally bought the camera and I started playing with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the stuff that they taught me at UT I already knew, but they explained me the </span><span>&lsquo;</span><span class="c2">how</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">. It&#39;s not the same thing, learning from experience that when somebody tells you the reasons behind the why. It was a good experience. I liked that &ndash; on the first set of the classes that we have, I was among the most advanced, if not the most advanced one. Then at the end, out of the 25 that started the course, only five of us finished. I was the only Latino in class, a situation that happened a lot on the job, on meetings. Even when I was going to watch movies, I </span><span>would</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;always go to watch the movies</span><span>. Y</span><span class="c1">ou won&#39;t see a lot of Latinos in there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the part that you liked the least?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I was alone. My wife ... I first started a relationship with somebody else, and we had a son, but it didn&#39;t work out because we were more friends than a couple. We decided to part ways. Then I met my wife, but she lives in Mexico. She all the time lived in Mexico. I met her when I was in high school. I met her again. She went there to see me. She got a visa. She went to see me, but she was already living here. She was divorced, and she had a daughter. She got a visa, but she couldn&#39;t get a visa for the daughter because the biological father had to sign for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time that we had a chance, like a long weekend or vacations, or every time I had money for the tickets, it&#39;s only a two hour flight from here to Austin or San Antonio, she would just fly to meet me and be there. We decided to marry. We had the idea to take the girl to live with us, because she cannot leave her daughter. She has to take her with her. But then she went to ask for the signature and he&#39;s like, &quot;What do you want it for?&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;I need it to take her out of the country because I&#39;m going to get married.&quot; He </span><span>says</span><span class="c1">, &quot;Nope, that&#39;s not going to happen.&quot; We started a legal procedure to get the paternity legally taken from him. We won three times and three times he&hellip; como se dice [how do you say]&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn&#39;t show up, or ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no. When you win something and then they contest. We won, and then he contested the resolution, and we started over again three times. That was for five years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you were in the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. My wife couldn&#39;t stay with me because she had her daughter here, and she couldn&#39;t take her with her because she didn&#39;t have the papers for her. I didn&#39;t want</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">to come here </span><span>because I already</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;knew how it was life here. I didn&#39;t have a career, even though I had a job as an electrician. It wasn&#39;t the same. I knew it wasn&#39;t the same. So I couldn&#39;t come here. I had a good job. I had started my own small company. I had my own credit on the supply houses, and I had a nice house. I had cars and everything, but I was going every </span><span>night to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;an empty house. Nice with electronics, clean, big, but empty house. So, I was always alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you end up back in Mexico? How old were you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After almost five years of going back and forth with the lawyers and this guy and the Mexican authorities on the family matters and all that, my wife decided, she was like, &quot;I can&#39;t take this anymore. I can be back and forth taking planes and not seeing you, seeing you every time we have a chance.&quot; For this, she got pregnant. The idea was for her to be over there </span><span>in the United</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;States when he was born, but he was born prematurely for one month and a half or something like that. She was about to take a car. I had some relatives that were going to take her in a car ride, because she couldn&#39;t fly. She had issues with the pregnancy. She was supposed to go from Mexico City all the way to Austin </span><span>in a car</span><span class="c1">. That was on a Friday. It was everything planned and ready, and the baby was born on a Tuesday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. But you guys were married in the US or in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We married in Austin three years ago. So, the baby was born here, not there. He had a visa. He visited me four times, only four times while I was in the States. I saw him four times. She was tired of taking care of a baby by herself and not seeing me and all that. She&#39;s like, &quot;We&#39;ll have to </span><span>make</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a decision.&quot; But one of the things that happened is that she saw a lot of racism, bad blood from the people at the immigration every time she was flying, especially in Houston.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She got detained two times just because she was with my son, with the older one. She had a permit</span><span>,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;a notarized permit and everything, but just because she wasn&#39;t the mother and just because she was Mexican she got detained. The two times they </span><span>detained</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;her for more than six hours, and they wanted me to go get them. They wanted me to be there physically, so they could arrest me. They called me and they said, &quot;We want you to be here, and if you don&#39;t have papers, we&#39;re going to take you back.&quot; I said, &quot;Well, let&#39;s do it.&quot; But by the time that I made it from Austin to Houston</span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; </span><span class="c2">because they were just switching planes to go to Austin</span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; b</span><span class="c1">y the time I made it to Houston, both times, they were already released. She had bad experiences in Atlanta with the ATA people and in Houston. So she&#39;s like, &quot;No, I don&#39;t like it.&quot; She didn&#39;t like it. She didn&#39;t see the side of Austin or of the United States that I see. I saw the job, the good money, the liberties and all that. She was there just once in a while, so she saw the bad experiences. That got most embedded in her mind more than the good things. She didn&#39;t like it there. We decided, especially after the election, once Trump was in power, I saw a lot of things happening on the streets, things that I would imagine only on movies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People getting detained just because. Police, immigration, going around on civilian cars. You&#39;re used to them going around on SUV&#39;s or armored cars or anything like that. No, they will be driving soccer mom cars, or pickup trucks, or small cars, Sedans. They will just pull you over, without asking you for an ID. They will just take you down to the ground and cuff you. I saw it. I don&#39;t know somebody that told me, no, no, no. I saw it several times. They went into the job sites that I was working at. As I said, I always used to be the only Latino on the job site. I saw them going in and they tried to cuff me once, but one of the superintendents on the job site, they told them it was illegal to get in there without a warrant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They already have a cuff on one of my hands. I was mad at the situation, mad at my personal situation with my wife and all that, and I was like, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go ahead. Come on, go ahead. Take me. I&#39;m going with you. I&#39;m not resisting,&quot; but everybody defended me, and they had to let me go. But I was ready to be the deported. They cuffed me, almost, with both hands, but they only cuffed me one. I was tired of all of that. I was doing side jobs by myself. I was working as an independent contractor with a company, so I was pretty much my own boss, but also I started my own company doing jobs with my own customers. They started to decline also.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&#39;t find helpers. The good helpers were mostly Latinos or the good ones, the American, good ones, they didn&#39;t </span><span>want</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to work more than 40 hours a week. That&#39;s one of the things that they have. They don&#39;t want to work more than 40. They have enough with that. Even if they don&#39;t have enough money, they don&#39;t want to work more. Whereas the Latinos, they always want to work. If </span><span>there&#39;s a chance</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to work, they will always work. I&#39;m not saying that they&#39;re better or worse, it&#39;s just different. It&#39;s a cultural thing, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I didn&#39;t have enough people to cover those jobs and some other jobs. I don&#39;t want to think it was because of racism, but it seemed that way. I got a job and they were like, &quot;You know what? I already have somebody else,&quot; and I knew they were going to charge them more and they were going to be white people. I don&#39;t want to accuse anybody of racism, but it sounded like that. I was just like, &quot;What am I doing here?</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;All my money, it&#39;s a lot of money I&#39;m making, and everything&#39;s going towards the lawyers and pretty much paying for two houses, for two households, and I&#39;m by myself, so I decided to come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody told me that I was crazy. They said, &quot;You have a good job. You have a good life. You have a &ndash; Everybody likes you on your job. They want you to stay. You&#39;re making good money. What are you going to do there? You&#39;re going to be making half the money that you&#39;ll make there in here.&quot; But I knew when I said, &quot;No, I&#39;m going to make half of what I make here. I&#39;m going to be making </span><span>at</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;most one eighth of what I make here,&quot; and that&#39;s what I make about. </span><span>A</span><span class="c1">n eighth of what I make there. I know I&#39;m going to the traffic. I know I&#39;m going to the violence, I&#39;m going to the crime, but my family&#39;s there. I can&#39;t bear this anymore. I can&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you come back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rented a truck, and I </span><span>got</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;all of the stuff that I could inside of the truck, and the rest of it either I tried to sell it, and what didn&#39;t sell, I just gave it away. I asked my brother to rent another truck, because we cannot cross the border with him. I dropped to the border with the truck, and we rented the services from the people that work at the border and help you with that kind of stuff. They crossed my things to the other side, and go put them on the other truck, and we just drove back into Mexico City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it like coming back? What was it like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard. I already knew what I was going into, but I was so used to the life the way it is out there. I already have a job. I already have a skill. I&#39;m an electrician. I do solar, industrial, commercial, and residential electricity. But when I got here, none of that matters. What it matters here is who&#39;s your friend. Who&#39;s your relative? In my experience, it didn&#39;t matter. I tried to do something good, and I was used to the jobs to be done within a certain </span><span>time frame</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in a professional manner, and I expect professionalism from everybody else. When I got here, I saw a lot of corruption, a lot of bad things in general. Nobody wants to pay you. They found always ways to don&#39;t pay you on time. They&#39;re not professionals. Their lack on their job skills affect mine, and then the presentation of my job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is bad and they don&#39;t want to pay for what I was doing then. The doctor says that everything had a toll on my health, and this December, I went into a hypertensive crisis. I couldn&#39;t even walk, drive, work. I had to leave work in the middle of the project. I wasn&#39;t getting paid. I was away from my family because there was no job in the city, so I have to go to</span><span>&nbsp;Cuernavaca</span><span class="c1">, and I have to drive in the morning, every Monday and come back on Friday. I was mad about it. I didn&#39;t say anything, but my wife is the one that said it. She said it for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like, &quot;Why did you come back, if you&#39;re already going to stay away? I see you every weekend, but still.&quot; I wasn&#39;t getting paid well, at least not on time or not all the money at once. I couldn&#39;t work. I started selling my tools. I started pawning my tools first and then selling them or pawning them and losing them. I finally find a job here on TTEC as a customer </span><span>service</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;representative. If I feel bad and I have to take my medicines, all I need to do is just pop the pill inside my mouth and I&#39;ll be dizzy, but I&#39;m sitting on a chair, so it doesn&#39;t matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever been approached by bad guys?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, twice. I got robbed twice. Well, they tried to rob me twice. The first time, it&#39;s one of those times when I was coming from trying to get some money, because I didn&#39;t have money. It was my son&#39;s birthday. It was in August. This guy came to me with a knife. When I realized that he was alone, I confronted him and I disarmed him and I was able to beat him up. Then the second time, these guys came and they just pushed me against the wall. They put the knives on me and they just took my money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about narcos or police or organized criminals? Have they ever tried to recruit you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police? Well, not to recruit me. Police, I&#39;ve seen my fair share already of corruption. I&#39;ve been detained at least three times and asked for money, just because they wanted to detain me and they wanted to take money from me just because, basically. They&#39;ll try to give excuses, and since they didn&#39;t find anything, they will just say me plainly. &quot;Well, we need money. What do we do about it?&quot; Narcos, I&#39;ve seen them selling drugs to young kids. Not like children, but at least like teenagers. They never approach me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never approach you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Did you find anything in Mexico? It doesn&#39;t have to be material. It can be like a feeling, just whatever here that you had in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A feeling that it&#39;s like the one I had in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you find something here that you had in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. What do you miss about the United States, if anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tranquility, the monetary freedom that I have, the freedom that I have not here. If I had a car, I can&#39;t go some places because of the traffic or because it&#39;s a danger zone. &quot;Are they going to take my car?&quot; I cannot buy a motorcycle because they&#39;re going to take it away next block. There are a lot of things that I cannot do in my own country. I knew that I was coming to this. It was bad in 2004 when I first left. But it wasn&#39;t that bad. It&#39;s worse now. It&#39;s way worse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you go back to the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had the chance to go back there legally, I will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you recommend that people migrate to the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they have a chance to do it, do it legally, yes. But we know how almost impossible that is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, especially now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what ways did being in the United States shape who you are or something that you believe in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was basically by myself most of the time, even though at first I was living with my uncle, but I had to find myself there. Here, I see a lot of the kids around here and I see where they&#39;re going. They are 17, 18, 19, 20 years old and still living with their parents. They will be like that for as long as they don&#39;t get kicked out. They will get married and they will still live there. They won&#39;t know anything. They won&#39;t know anything different. I went there and I saw a different culture, a different way. I was there on a place and I learned, if you work hard, you get something in return. You don&#39;t see that here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that I said earlier is that it wasn&#39;t as bad back then and it is now, but everybody doesn&#39;t seem surprised because that&#39;s what they see every day. These kids, they&#39;re growing up with it. That&#39;s what they have. That&#39;s what they see. They don&#39;t see anything differently. I went there, and I saw something different. I saw different sites because most of my friends, at first, they weren&#39;t Latinos and later, some of them were Latinos. I don&#39;t say Mexicans, because there&#39;s a lot of Latinos in there. They&#39;re from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Peru, Guatemala, Chile, Cuba, Puerto Rico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a lot of those people and I got friends everywhere from all over the world, but most of my friends were American or at least Americanized people, if you want to call them like that, not because they were more important or they were better than somebody, but they were on a more civilized mind. Might be a wrong term to use, but it&#39;s the one that I can find right now, because they wouldn&#39;t throw papers on the street. They won&#39;t throw away the trash on their street. They will take care of their lawn. They will pay their taxes. They will say hello in the morning, whenever they arrive somewhere, whenever they meet somebody new, they will be polite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a different cultural side of their world, and several of them, because it&#39;s not the same being in Northwest Austin as being on the South of Austin or the East side. On the East side, there&#39;s like the ghetto part of the Black people and the Latino people. It&#39;s very different from Northwest. There&#39;s a lot of Latino people, but it&#39;s different. Their ideas are different. Austin</span><span>&nbsp;is </span><span class="c1">a small Mexico City, depending on where you&#39;re at, it&#39;s a different world, blocks away from another world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shaped me different from when I was here? If I was going to be here, I was going to be probably like my younger brother. He just grabs whatever jobs he can find as long as they pay him, and then after a while he gets bored and he moves on to another job, a different trade, a different thing. He doesn&#39;t have a specialty. He&#39;s 29 years old. In six years, he will be 35. He will be my age, but he won&#39;t have anything where they can hire him and give him a good pay. A lot of people is like that. When I was there, I realized, &quot;Okay, you work hard, you learn something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned to speak English because it was my goal. Most of the people that I knew, they went there with a goal, and it was a monetary goal. It was like, &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; Everybody&#39;s answer was like, &quot;I want to buy a house, or I want to pay my mom&#39;s house and buy a truck.&quot; My answer was always, &quot;I want to save some money so I can go back to Mexico to study and learn English.&quot; Everybody laughed at me, and I felt their laugh, but not in a bad way, but I like when people tell me, &quot;You can&#39;t do this.&quot; I love it when somebody tell me, &quot;You can&#39;t do it.&quot; I&#39;m color blind, and I&#39;m a photographer and an electrician. A lot of people told me, &quot;You can&#39;t do it.&quot; I love it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being there by myself, doing the things by myself is what shaped me. Learning from a different culture and learning the good things, the good ways of a different culture helped me. I met a lot of people from China, from India, from Europe in there. I saw the difference in their cultures. I tried to get the best of them on each one of them. Here, it doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re coming from, how educated, well educated you are, how prepared you are. It doesn&#39;t matter how articulate you are. If I don&#39;t like you, you&#39;re not going to make it on this job. If I am the boss, and I don&#39;t like you, you&#39;re not going to make it. That&#39;s what happens here. There&#39;s no professionalism. There&#39;s no well-being culture. There&#39;s nothing good here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was all my questions. I don&#39;t know if you have anything else that you want to say, or anything that you want to add or want me to know or us to know, or just whatever you want, really.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that I said, it&#39;s that I didn&#39;t imagine only in movies, what I saw over there, people getting detained on the streets. There&#39;s something that I heard over and over again. Whenever you &ndash; Even if you&#39;re a Latino, even if you&#39;re an illegal, you get </span><span>used</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to the law in there. Of course, it sounds like an oxymoron because you are an illegal, and you&#39;re used to the law, but if you get detained, let&#39;s say you&#39;re going 65 on a 50 mile per hour zone. You know that if you pull over, put your hands on the wheel and you&#39;re polite to the cop, you might get away with it, or you might get a ticket and that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If something goes wrong with, I don&#39;t know, your fries on McDonald&#39;s or what you ordered on a restaurant, or what are your glasses from the store</span><span>,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span class="c1">ll you need to do is just to say, &quot;I&#39;m not happy with this. What can I do about it?&quot; If somebody&#39;s violating your rights, you have to say, &quot;You know what? This is my right. I can do this.&quot; What I saw when people got detained is people getting used to that kind of law and saying, &quot;You can&#39;t do this. This is illegal,&quot; and the US border and customs agents answering always in either an English or Spanish, &quot;What are you going to do about it? Who are you going to tell, my President?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was always the same answer. &quot;What you&#39;re doing is illegal.&quot; &quot;What are you going to say about it? What are you going to accuse me with, my President?&quot; Always the same answer. And sadly, that was true. Who to complain? I had a friend who got detained not long ago, and I think he&#39;s still on the other side, because we haven&#39;t heard from him. I hope he&#39;s still detained, because if not, and we haven&#39;t heard from him, that&#39;s bad. But he told me what he saw when he was in, I think it&#39;s McAllen, where all the detaining centers with the kids are. They said it&#39;s like concentration camps for the kids. He cried when he told me, and he&#39;s a tough guy, because he has kids.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c2">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His kids are in Austin. He cried when he told me. And I&#39;m glad that my son has a passport and he can go back and forth. He just came from Austin on Friday. And I just saw him in San </span><span>Miguel de Allende in Guanajuato. </span><span class="c2">I&#39;m glad that he&#39;s fine. He can go and come without being an illegal. I&#39;m glad. I will tell. I was on the border, and I crossed illegally. I can tell you that&#39;s an adventure because nothing happened to me. I was lucky, but I will say to somebody who trie</span><span>s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to cross, don&#39;t. Don&#39;t go, don&#39;t do it, especially now. Don&#39;t do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. Nothing else?
