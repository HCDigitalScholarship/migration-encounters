I&#39;m Claudia, and I am interviewing</span><span>...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moises.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for coming and speaking with us today. First, before we begin, I just want to say that I understand that speaking about these stories and talking about them, and telling them again can be a little difficult, because they bring about emotions and memories that you don&#39;t necessarily want to relive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah</span><span>.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>N</span><span class="c1">o.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think it&#39;s good to know how important your story is, and not just to kind of say it, but to have other people hear it, so that they can begin to understand the realities of migration and the human side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess my first question for you is what is your earliest memory of the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess it would be school, being at school. Yeah, that&#39;s the earliest memory I have, being in school. Like the whole experience and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember any teachers or friends, or people who had a big impact?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess friends, like childhood friends, I pretty much remained friends with them up until I guess after high school. </span><span>Everybody</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;goes their ways, but yeah, it would be my friends. Just school, like the whole ... Home wasn&#39;t really too much going on, you know? Going to school was life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your life like in the States? What did you do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical go to school, and just, I don&#39;t know, be a knucklehead. After my son was born, it was work. Just try to enjoy life. Try to provide. Yeah, I grew up being a big brother and stuff, so I was always looking out for my sisters and whoever I can. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned in your survey that you were afraid of the authorities after you turned 15. Why was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s I guess when reality kind of hit. Growing up before that, I was really not aware of my status, I guess, my immigration status. When I was 15, I think after that it was when college became a topic of interest. I applied for a couple of scholarships, and then that&#39;s when I kind of figured out that I wasn&#39;t ... How do you say it? I didn&#39;t have a social security number and stuff like that. That&#39;s when it all kind of sunk in. I was like, &quot;Oh, damn. I could potentially get thrown out of here.&rdquo; And so Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said that you didn&#39;t qualify for DACA relief?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I did, and I was in the process, it&#39;s just there&#39;s certain things that I had to ... I guess I had to get my police record and stuff like that, and turn them in and stuff like that. I didn&#39;t have anything big, it was just a couple of tickets here and there. But when I was in the process of doing that, that&#39;s when I got arrested, and I guess that disqualified me from being qualified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you get arrested?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? I was with a couple of friends, like I said, I got pulled over, we got pulled over, and there was drugs in the car and stuff like that, </span><span>p</span><span class="c6">retty much</span><span>.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>Y</span><span class="c6">ou just gotta ride it out</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, how old were you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like 29 I think, yeah. Yeah, about 29. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said that you graduated high school and you went to college for a little bit?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like a semester. Yeah, yeah. That&#39;s when I just pretty much started working full-time. I was working, but then it just became more of a necessary thing. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were you working?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s when I started working at a fast food place, I think it was Carl&#39;s Jr. for like a year or something. Then I just kind of hopped around jobs here and there, until I landed a job at the grocery store.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and that ended up pretty much being my longest job. I worked there like six years. It was cool, I enjoyed it. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me about how you ended up back in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? Well, I got arrested and pretty much... I bailed out and I spent a little time fighting my case. They were trying to get me for a bunch of stuff that wasn&#39;t true, I knew I was innocent of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They tried to get me for a bunch of... Because my friends I was with at the time, they were known gang members and stuff like that, so they tried to get me for a bunch of gang enhancements and drug transporting, and stuff like that. I was like, &quot;Man, this is ridiculous.&quot; I ended up fighting my case for almost a year I think. Then when I got convicted, when I signed my sentencing, I was out, so I didn&#39;t get picked up. But then I got put on probation, and my first violation I got arrested, and that&#39;s when I got picked up by ICE.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get put on probation for the same, like...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, for the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case that you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you ever affiliated with any gang or did you ever join one?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean I guess you could say... Growing up, I grew up around it, so it was kind of like... But I mean I wasn&#39;t in a gang, but most of my closest friends were gang members. I guess it was there, but I knew better, so I never really got too involved in that stuff. It was more of just being around it. As much as I could, I just stayed away. You know what I mean? Yeah, I tried to focus on, I don&#39;t know, like providing and stuff like that. Yeah, it wasn&#39;t too big of an issue. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me about your return to Mexico. What was that like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well</span><span>,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;it </span><span>was... I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;guess devastating. I didn&#39;t know what I was going to do. That&#39;s why I spent so long in Immigration, I was there for a year, I guess trying to get bail. But since my case, my charges was pretty much I guess you would say unforgivable, I guess, it was kind of like there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to get bail or I&#39;m going to get a pardon or anything like that. I was just like, &quot;Damn.&quot; I was pretty much just buying time, trying to figure something out, because my mom didn&#39;t want me to go back to where I was born, in Guerrero, because I guess it&#39;s bad. She was like, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re going to get picked up or something like that right away.&quot; Especially because she says you could tell right away I&#39;m not from around here. I was like, &quot;Damn.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, then afterwards she told me about a friend of the family that lives here in the city. He was willing to I guess take me in, and kind of give me a head&#39;s up and stuff. That&#39;s when I was like, &quot;All right, then let&#39;s do this.&quot; Yeah, after that it was just... I don&#39;t know, I was depressed. I guess I still am, but it was just hard, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t want to do anything for a while, and I drank a lot. But now I&#39;ve kind of got that under control and it&#39;s not really an issue anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel a lot more confident to start making something happen, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other than that, it was just hard, man. My son, I don&#39;t know, and the situation with his mom, she doesn&#39;t really like to keep in contact with me. It&#39;s just hard, man, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Wait, just because I went a little too fast, can you tell me, you spent time in </span><span>c</span><span class="c1">ounty, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then an Immigration hold?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me about those facilities? The treatment there and that sort of thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment there? I mean </span><span>county</span><span class="c6">, it&#39;s jail, you know? I would say</span><span>...</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;treatment I guess... I mean I can&#39;t really complain about nothing. It&#39;s jail, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration though, that place is depressing, you know? You hear about everybody&#39;s in the same situation, you know what I mean? You see people come in all the time, and they leave. If you&#39;re there for a minute, it&#39;s just depressing. You know what I mean? You see a lot of people in similar situations, and just the desperation. It&#39;s just a sad place to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as treatment, I guess it&#39;s a little more less professional, I guess, because it&#39;s run by a private security or something like that. There&#39;s not officers, they&#39;re not real officers. I guess they belittle you. They just tell you, &quot;Oh yeah, you&#39;re getting deported. You really don&#39;t matter.&quot; You almost feel like that, you know? They kind of look at you like a little less. At least in jail, the County jail, that wasn&#39;t an issue, but once you get to </span><span>admissions</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;they all treat you like, &quot;Oh yeah, you&#39;re getting deported.&quot; You know what I mean? Or whatever. It&#39;s like a joke, kind of like a joke to them&hellip; or that&#39;s how I felt. Yeah, it was just a bad place to be. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk to me a little bit about the difficulties of having been separated from your family and your son when you came back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, typical... Yes, probably the hardest thing, part that I&#39;m going through. The hardest thing. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just difficult. Sometimes I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do. Sorry. Yeah, I just try not to think about it sometimes. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what to say, it&#39;s just difficult. I really don&#39;t know how to cope with it sometimes or what I&#39;m going to do. I&#39;ve got hope I&#39;m going to figure it out, I have to. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah, I just hope that I&#39;m going to be able to have a relationship with them somehow some way, it pretty much keeps me going. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been in contact with him recently? How old is he?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s nine. I think it&#39;s been six months, I haven&#39;t spoken to him. Like I said, his mom&#39;s kind of being difficult. The only chance I really talk to him is when my mom gets to I guess take care of him or be around him. That&#39;s when I get to talk to him. She calls me and stuff. But yeah, I think in July he&#39;s going to be out of summer school, and she&#39;s finally going to... She moved out of the city, so she doesn&#39;t live in the city, but she&#39;s going to drop him off, his mom, so he&#39;s going to be with my mom for a little bit. I&#39;m looking forward to talking to him then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been the hardest part of being back in Mexico for you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say just dealing with that, and everything else, like the language. I&#39;ve got a very heavy accent, I guess, and people just look at me like, &quot;What the fuck?&quot; Just that, and just communicating. I guess that feeling of not belonging. It wasn&#39;t really too much over there, but here I just feel it in every aspect and everywhere. They look at you differently and stuff like that. The community of returnees and stuff like that is pretty much a lifesaver. We&#39;re pretty much there for each other. We can relate to each other. Other than that it&#39;s, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m grateful for that, but at the same time it&#39;s kind of like it sucks. We&#39;re all in it, but at least we&#39;re in it together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you talk a little bit more about that being different in every aspect, and then also about the migrant community here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, different, I mean everything&#39;s different. I&#39;m just alone. Before, no matter </span><span>where...</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;situation financially or whatever, I always had somebody or somewhere to go, or my family. Here, because I don&#39;t have any family here, so really if I&#39;m maxed out, I&#39;m maxed out. You know what I mean? Other than that, trying to get a job is intimidating I guess, because of my Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, just going out and just talking to anybody, I always feel I guess a little shy or a little intimidated, just by the fact of me not getting heard right or getting understood. I just avoid it, I guess. Yeah, the language is pretty much a very big one, and being alone. Financially, I&#39;m lucky, my family, my mom and my sisters, they send me a little bit of money every month, but I guess I&#39;m maybe a little comfortable too, so I need to just I guess get out of my little, I don&#39;t know how to describe... My little-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bubble, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, just got out of it and just start I guess just living a little bit. I guess I&#39;m just stuck, I don&#39;t know, just being sad I guess or something. Little by little... But other than that... Yeah, the community, like I said, it&#39;s everything to me right now. When I first got here, I would stay in the room all day and just drink. I wouldn&#39;t talk to nobody. After a while, I met others. After that, I landed in a house where they all live, and I never left pretty much. I moved in, and other than that, they&#39;ve been my family. We look out for each other. Like I said, if it wasn&#39;t for them, I don&#39;t know where I would be right now or if I would still be here. I don&#39;t know. You know what I mean? It&#39;s pretty much they&#39;re like my family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&#39;s difficult, because we&#39;re all in the same situation. Some of us have that attitude like we don&#39;t care. I guess it&#39;s destructive. Just coping with other people, that. I guess it&#39;s just depressing at the same time. But the reality is it&#39;s the only thing we&#39;ve got, I would say. Again, I&#39;m grateful, but I just wish I could do a little more, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned that you&#39;ve gotten help from the government?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A government employment service?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. That was just for six months they give you two and a half grand I think for six months. All you&#39;ve got to do is show that paper you get at the border, and just prove your residence and stuff like that. Yeah, I mean it&#39;s pretty easy. The only thing that&#39;s really difficult here is getting around, figuring stuff out. People are very not helpful. Everybody&#39;s attitude here is nobody wants to help each other, even with directions. It&#39;s kind of strange to me, but that&#39;s been very very, very hard. Asking people for directions, simple things like that, that are just... They make it extremely difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, other than that, like I said, my family helps me financially. You know what I mean? I pretty much don&#39;t have anything, I just get by. I haven&#39;t really done nothing. You know what I mean? I guess this whole time I&#39;ve just been dealing with my emotions and not being very successful. I think now I feel a lot better, and I&#39;m ready to start making something happen, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you consider yourself a Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean I always considered myself Mexican. I never really considered myself American, just the fact because I&#39;m not. There&#39;s that little, I don&#39;t know how to say it, like discrimination a little bit. But then here, now I&#39;m starting to feel like I&#39;m not Mexican.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because like I said, I can&#39;t speak the language. I don&#39;t know anything really. Yeah, I just feel like an outsider. I feel like that and they make you feel like that. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn&#39;t for my nationality paperwork and stuff, I wouldn&#39;t even... You know what I mean? I wouldn&#39;t be able to prove I was Mexican I think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. If you could have stayed in the United States, what do you think you would have done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if I would have stayed after the fact of getting in trouble and stuff like that, I mean I would have just kept trying to improve. Like self-improvement, and just provide for my family, and just be good. Just enjoy life, stuff like that. If I would have never got in trouble, then I guess I would have just kept doing bad, kept stuck in that whole little depression and stuff like that. I was depressed before I got deported, and after I got deported it just got worse. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think you&#39;d like to do now that you&#39;re back in Mexico? What are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, just to be in my son&#39;s life. That&#39;s pretty much it. Just to help everybody else around me, everybody that&#39;s in a similar situation. Just to maybe change Mexico a little bit. Just make it more... I don&#39;t know, just change the life here. Like I said, everybody here is just out for themselves, and it&#39;s just very not what I thought Mexico was. My idea of Mexico was, I don&#39;t know, just old-fashioned, respectful. Like um</span><span>... </span><span class="c1">How do you say? I don&#39;t know. Just a little more together. But the people here are very against each other. It&#39;s just a free for all, you know? Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to do, just change that a little bit and make life a little better for people coming back, and just somehow, some way, be more in my son&#39;s life, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean I think... Damn, I&#39;m not really sure. I don&#39;t really think there&#39;s nothing much they could do. I think the little help they do, I think that&#39;s great, but at the same time, I want to say they could do more, but I really don&#39;t know what. Most of us are like, already damaged, so what can they really do? Maybe a little shelter, I guess. That would probably be the main thing, and maybe some type of, I don&#39;t know... Yeah, I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t really thought about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s cool. Those were all the questions that I had, but I want to give you the chance now to say anything else that you want to say. If there&#39;s anything else that you want to add that you feel like you didn&#39;t tell me or you want people to know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say... I don&#39;t know. I would say it&#39;s crazy difficult. What we&#39;re experiencing I guess is new, it&#39;s a new situation, there&#39;s not much attention. I would say, like I said, one way or another I would say we&#39;re going to change Mexico, I&#39;m hoping for the better. One way or another, it&#39;s going to change. It&#39;s accumulating to something, you know what I mean? I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s something good. If there&#39;s not any I guess attention, then people just kind of shrug it off. Then people like me, if they feel like, I don&#39;t know, like no one cares or something like that, then it&#39;s probably going to get worse for us and whoever else is around us. But yeah, that&#39;s pretty much it I guess. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you satisfied with what you&#39;ve told me and all that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Moises:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much.
