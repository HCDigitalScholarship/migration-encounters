They just wanted to have a little bit more money. My grandma and some uncles were over there. So they just took me when I was like six, and I was over there for 15 years. And I just started hanging out with the wrong people, so I just ended up doing bad stuff, so they just deported me. Or voluntary departure, sort of the same things though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you been back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me about sort of the early time in the US.

I pretty much grew up over there. I started going to school over there, they put me in fifth grade. And since in fifth grade, I learned English in two years. And just started going to high school, middle school, and all that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So didn&#39;t you start in first grade?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you were six.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was six. When I was right here in Mexico, I was in fourth grade right here, this is because when I went over there, they put me in fifth grade because of my age.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. I see. And you learned English there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did it take?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.

And which state or city were you in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Jose, California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Jose, California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Jose?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, great.

Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you like school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of, yeah. The only class I liked was science, but I never really was good on math and the other classes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you enjoy the extracurriculars? Like sports or art or music?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sports. Yeah, sports. Yeah, I liked sports. That was pretty, yeah, much just one of the classes that I liked too, sports, PE.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you had lots of friends, you said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, there was a lot of friends, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they continued through elementary and middle and high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them. Yeah, some of them. Some of them, we just got separated because they were going to different schools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you have siblings with you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, my brothers. I got my little brother there, right now he&#39;s 17. And my big sister there, she&#39;s 26.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what was home life like in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pretty good, man. Actually, it was really different when we were here. We still have our house right here, but it&#39;s just the streets and people, how they act, is really different. There&#39;s a lot of loss over here, so I hear pretty much it&#39;s different in the way that cops, they don&#39;t really care about you right here, you know? You got to be, you can say one man by themselves. So yeah, it&#39;s pretty much different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, pretty much different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was your dad with you as well? Or just your mom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. No, my mom and my dad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what kind of jobs did they get in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, she&#39;s a general for the stadiums. Right now, I think she&#39;s working and she&#39;s the general for an advisory, but I don&#39;t know which one. And my dad, he works in air conditioning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as you were growing up, when did you start getting in trouble?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think when I was in middle school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In middle school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In middle school, I started hanging out with the wrong people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it gangs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Started hanging out with gangs and I ended up doing bad stuff.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we see that a lot. That young boys who come to the States from Mexico, they do end up often getting connected with gangs or with some crime. Why do you think that is?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">I don&#39;t know, man. I really don&#39;t know, because I used to have a loving family. I used to get all the love from my mom and my dad. And I don&#39;t know, I just started hanging out with them, just, I don&#39;t know, because I was bored? You could say I was bored at home, so I just started going out. So I think that&#39;s one of the reasons why I got in gangs. There&#39;s some other people that get in gangs because they don&#39;t got nobody taking care of them at home, so they just go out looking for that love, you know?</span><span class="c1"><br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you had the love?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I had the love, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. Huh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about girls, friends? Did you have girlfriends during that time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I had a lot of... Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You liked the girls?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Any problems with drugs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just use the normal, just weed, that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weed? Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how far did you get in school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finished high school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh you did?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you did okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did, yeah. You can say I did okay. I finished high school, I graduated from middle school. So just you can say, I was just going like to Liberty High School, that&#39;s like you do your work at home. They give you all the packages. So I was not like really in school, I was just...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that because you&#39;d gotten in trouble?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I used to get a lot in trouble at school. I don&#39;t know why. I used to just be the type of guy that used to move a lot. You know, I used to not stay in just one place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you get expelled and then you did the Liberty High School?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me, did you know that you were not documented?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I went with documents. I had a visa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you did?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I had a visa, and I just lost it because I started getting incarcerated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you could get a license and you could get a social security card and all that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, and I just lost everything when I just started going to prison and all that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when was the first time you were imprisoned? Or caught, or convicted of a crime?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was, I think, 17. Yeah, perhaps I was 17.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after you&#39;d graduated from high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what was the crime for?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possession of a gun, drugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you selling drugs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you could say that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you end up in jail after that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I started going back to jail, just in and out of juvenile halls, branches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started with juvenile because you were 17?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, juvenile. Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were your parents also documented? Do they have papers?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you get the papers, if they...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because pretty much, I guess my mom started doing the paperwork since before we left from Mexico, so we got approved just for a tourist visa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, a tourist visa. Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were trying to apply, but they didn&#39;t got qualified. I don&#39;t know why, </span><span class="c14">it&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;kind of weird. And one of my uncles just told them we&rsquo;d just send them, and we&#39;ll take good care of them meanwhile you guys crossing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you had a tourist visa, so it was easy to cross for you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that&#39;s great. But not for your mom and dad?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for my mom and my dad, no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did your parents get you lawyers and that sort of thing for your...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.

And I don&#39;t know if we are going to be able to save my case or not.

You either decide if you&#39;re going to do good or you&#39;re still going to be doing bad stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you decide?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do good. I just wanted to get out. I already know how to do time, I just wanted to get out, and be with my family. I never thought I was going to get deported. So that happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So once you got out of jail, did ICE take you? Or did you have some sort of-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, ICE. ICE took me right away. When I was about to get out, it was a week, and then before the week, ICE came and they were like, &quot;Hey you, we got a hold on you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were out for a week?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was, I was...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About to...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About to get out. One week before I got out, and they just came and snatched me. They were like, &quot;Hey, we know you got a visa, but for your record, I think you&#39;re going to have to fight for your visa.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you go in front of a judge, or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, everything. I went and I do it all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you decided on </span><span class="c3">voluntary departure?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were you married at that point or no?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not at that point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she come to Mexico to marry you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, she&#39;s right here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I actually got married when I was locked up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh you did?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she came with you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. Right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is good because she&#39;s a keeper, you know? She was willing to just not care what her family said, just to follow me. So yeah, it&#39;s really good. It feels good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk to lots of fellas who get deported and their wives are like just, you know, good riddance, but that&#39;s great that she came with you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Right now, we&#39;re having little troubles, but I&#39;m just trying to get her to have Mexican papers so she can work here, so we&#39;re going through it, but we&#39;re managing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s been two years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, two years. Already two years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it hard to readjust?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because at first I was not able to find a job. And after like a year, I started finding about the call centers. I used to work for this right here, and TTech. So I used to work for Dish and then I moved to SmartPay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where do you work now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SmartPay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a US company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Just for people that speak Spanish and English though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you came back to Mexico, did you have relatives to live with? Or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I did. I got a lot of family here, but I don&#39;t really talk to them. I don&#39;t know, they look at me weird, so I just don&#39;t talk to them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you&#39;re American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because they see me tattooed from the head, and they think I&#39;m doing bad stuff, so I don&#39;t really talk to them. Just keep it to myself. Just be with myself.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;ve lived by yourself since you&#39;ve been here? With your...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, with my wife.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your wife. And she&#39;s a US citizen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is it hard for her to get papers to work in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It&#39;s just crazy. It&#39;s really difficult because the Mexican pesos, you need to put the marriage certificate in Spanish and you need to do all this stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, it&#39;s more easy for us. As soon as you do all that, it&#39;s easier for her to get the papers than me getting the papers from the US, but it&#39;s a hassle, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I bet. But you&#39;re sort of trying to make a go of it here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you&#39;ll go back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I am going to go back. I miss my parents and my brothers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s tough, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you&#39;ll try and go legally? Or...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, legally. Yeah, because I&#39;m not trying to get locked up again. Not trying to waste more time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And given she&#39;s a US citizen, maybe...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Maybe then I&#39;ll get a better shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you miss about the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything. Over here, it&#39;s really difficult to get a car, they cost too much. Over there, it&#39;s easier to get anything, you know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss the food. It&#39;s not the same. I miss a lot of things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Do you think living in the US made you a different person? Like different than you would have been if you&#39;d stayed in Mexico all your life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the way of thinking. Just a lot of things that you can say that if you would&#39;ve stayed in Mexico, you would&#39;ve just been like just one of the... You know, just work hard. Because right here in Mexico, the thing is that there&#39;s a lot of companies that, Mexican companies, that they&#39;ve hired people, but they get paid really low, you know? When I really got here, I used to work in a company, I used to get paid a 1100 for the whole week. And I used to work hard, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then when I moved to call centers, I get paid in pesos, but I get paid more, for even more money. So you can say being in the US, you can learn English and just come to Mexico and just be a better person. You just need a little knowledge for you to actually be somebody.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were your dreams when you grew up when you were in the US? What were your dreams for your life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the normal, just have a good job, have a family. That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they different now that you&#39;re here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I still going to just get a family. But I&#39;m not trying to make a family here, I&#39;m just trying to go back so I can be with my family.<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stick with your wife?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, you can say that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you like to have children?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely, yeah. It&#39;s already time for me to have children so I can just focus on them, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think raising kids in the US is different than raising kids in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh absolutely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it different?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s more tougher here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Over there in the US, it&#39;s difficult too, but you can get a lot around faster. There&#39;s a lot of things that they can help you and all that. So it&#39;s difficult to have children over here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Is there anything you&#39;d like to share about your experiences as a kid growing up first in Mexico and then the US, and then being deported? Like anything that you&#39;d like to share about being a returning migrant with people who are going to hear about your experiences?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, just I had a dark past. I think all Mexicans that go to the US, they have that problem. I just got involved with the wrong people, man, and just ended up being in Mexico. I never thought I was going to be, but I guess if you go with them, you know what you&#39;re getting yourself into. So pretty much just, maybe you can give a message to young Mexicans just to not get in gangs, you know? Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you&#39;re turning your life around right now, so that&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s wonderful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am turning my life around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s great.<br></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, best of luck to you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Julian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><div><p class="c8"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page </span><span class="c6">&nbsp;of </span></p></div><div class="c11"><p class="c10"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c2">lack of compassion, judgment based on appearances, connotations of tattoos</span></p></div></body></html>
