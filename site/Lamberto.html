What country were you born in?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what city?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a little community, it&#39;s called La Palma. It belongs to San Blas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s Nayarit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nayarit State, for sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect. Did you go to school in Mexico before you went to the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I was born here and they took me when I was... Few days before five years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you didn&#39;t work either?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah never, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not here before you went.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, never.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, just a second. I&#39;ll add that in one second. Why did your family migrate to the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For economic reasons, for violence, for discrimination, to reunite with family, for another reason?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think I don&#39;t have the question about that because I was a kid. I think my dad had that question, and they took me when I was a kid. Well, my dad, he went when he was 16 years old up to the States. He grew up over there, went to work many years and he came back to Mexico and married my mom. And then we were born, and then he took me up to the States when I was almost five years old. So you could definitely say maybe, because it was economic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I definitely...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&#39;re not sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely have a question for that. I&#39;m not real sure about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it something you ask yourself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I&#39;ve never asked my dad why he took us up to the States, so I can&#39;t definitely say about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t have a question for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. So you were five?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did your family enter the United States? On a tourist visa, on a migrant visa? Did they cross the border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my dad told me that when he went to the States, there were... There was maybe already a line of people taking care up at the border, but he told me it was not a big deal in those days. Like, he could went into the States any time he want, and come back to Mexico. It was so easy in those days when he was a kid. Now it&#39;s a big problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you went, you just crossed the border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, when I was a kid... When he took me when I was a kid, I remember it because I still remember we were hiding. The border patrol police. I remember we were hiding, making sure they won&#39;t be able to catch us or get us in our chances crossing. It&#39;s a different story from mine and my dad, when I was a kid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember being frightened?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I remember all that. I remember since I was three years, I think, of my life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I still remember when one day, they, my grandma took me to kindergarten in Mexico in my town. Then we went back to home and then we spend a whole day, then I remember in the night one of my uncles went into our house and say... Your dad say we will take you tomorrow. I remember that. We crossed the river, the Rio Bravo. We cross it. And we, I remember the helicopters and I remember police officers. I remember all that kind of...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, you remember the helicopters?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I remember all that when I was a kid, yeah. It&#39;s a big story, it&#39;s a big thing. A lot different from my dad when he was a kid or a young person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way was it different?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in my days there was more police, or people taking care about the border. Then when my dad was a kid, he told me there was nothing. You just go by and come back. It was different things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you remember the helicopters flying?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I remember helicopters flying up on top of us. I remember police officers. I remember my uncle and other persons hiding in the bushes under the river.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember all that. Why I would forget? I haven&#39;t got a reason to forget. But, that&#39;s a whole big thing...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrifying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was a kid. I might feel it in those days, I don&#39;t feel it right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but still these memories that stay with you, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, things you never forget.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you guys apply for political asylum when you entered the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there&#39;s a lot of things I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. Yeah. I was just a kid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did you ever become a U.S. resident?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we went to school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get your papers though?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Did you speak any English as a five-year-old?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, before I went to kindergarten, I used to see a lot of TV. That&#39;s how I learned my English, seeing TV.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before you went</span><span>..</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my neighbors, thanks to my neighbors. When I went to school, I remember I used to speak a lot of what I know. That was before going to school. Then I went to school for maybe six years, six years and a half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me get through, because you&#39;re adding to some of my questions. How would you describe your English now? Would you say it&#39;s fluent? Good?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what cities did you live in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Sacramento.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we were in Pacoima.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Pacoima</span><span class="c0">. It&#39;s in the same area, in the Valley area. And then... There&#39;s another place, I just don&#39;t remember that place right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many years of school did you do in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think around six years, six years and a half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you work in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, never. I was just a kid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did you live with when you were in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents.

Three of my brothers. They were born over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were born there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They were born in-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Anybody else live with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, just family. Mom and dad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you frightened of U.S. authorities?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you send... Did your family send money back home?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope, because we don&#39;t have... Well, my parents have family down here, but they don&#39;t have kids. So no, not that I know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when you left the U.S. again?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I was around, let&#39;s see. About 11 and a half or 11 years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did, okay you were too young to... Why did you leave the United States? Did you guys make the decision? Were you deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you given voluntary departure?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We voted in my family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You voted in your family?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad just say one morning, &quot;You guys want to be here? You want to go back home?&quot; We all voted and we all end up deciding to come back to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you want to go back to Mexico? What did you vote?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I voted to come down back to Mexico. I grew up with my grandpa, so... They were getting older, sick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was impossible that I&#39;d be able to see him again. So we all voted to come back to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was unanimous?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody agreed?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. One of my brothers, my older brother, he didn&#39;t want to come back to Mexico, but it was nothing compared to all my family. We all voted , so we went. That&#39;s the reason we&#39;re here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. Okay, so how many years have you been back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been in Mexico for 20, 32... 20 years. 20 years and a half, maybe in Mexico since I came back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where do you live now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here in Sayulita. I&#39;ve been here 14 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who do you live with now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By my own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Just myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you study after you came back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I went a couple of years to school. I quit for few years... well the question would be yes...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well how long did you study?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe four or five years more, and then I quit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t finish high school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope. Not when I came back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of high school, did you do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I finished high school when I was an adult already. I went through high school, I&#39;m going to university right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you&#39;re going to university? You&#39;re still studying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, </span><span>still studying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. What are you studying at university?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I do birds. So what is that called?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornithology.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ornithology, yeah. Related with that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. We&#39;ve been wondering what birds are outside. So you&#39;ve been working since you&#39;ve been back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&rsquo;ve been...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of jobs?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I did a lot of farming and a</span><span>griculture</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;when I was a kid, with my parents. In the last, say, 10 years, I&#39;ve been doing birdwatching and guiding people. A guide for the last 10 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What got you interested in birds?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my town owns a little farm in </span><span>San Blas</span><span class="c0">, a crocodile farm. I was raised there. I used to do a lot of volunteering work so I get to learn about crocodiles and mammals, and then that&#39;s where I met the guy or the person who got me into the birding. Since that, I&#39;ve been birding and doing nature-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You worked with crocodiles?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Crocodiles, reptiles, and mammals. And then I do right now it&rsquo;s more about birding and wildlife photography, that&rsquo;s what I do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did anything ever happen to you with a crocodile?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I got a couple of bites on my hand, small crocodiles, but nothing bad. Ever been okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was scarier, crossing the border with the helicopters or working with crocodiles?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Well</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I really don&#39;t remember when I was a kid, if I was real scary or things like that. I used to feel scared for crocodiles at the beginning. After a couple months, it&#39;s like talking with somebody else. It&#39;s real simple, because you know what you have to do when things like that. It&#39;s so easy when you know what you&#39;re doing, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. I am really scared of crocodiles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just like any other kind of animals. You have to learn, you know. When you know about what you&#39;re doing and when you know what&#39;s around you, it&#39;s real easy. It&#39;s like seeing a movie. It&#39;s like talking with somebody. It&#39;s real easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much are you paid in your current job?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I work for myself, so I make what I want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how much roughly do you earn?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well in the season, I can make for a day, 250 U.S., Which is good. And in some season, I can make 60, 70 U.S. in a day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60, 70?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Not too bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s not bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel safe in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s a question that I think its depends to how you are. In Mexico, we got all kind of people the way it is right now. The corruption, things like that. Where you got people who </span><span>abhor</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the corruption, and they feel safe because they got all these people around them. And there&#39;s people like me who doesn&#39;t like corruption, and who doesn&#39;t like things like that. But if you&#39;re brave enough, you don&#39;t care about that. You can save yourself. Sometimes it&#39;s more about faith and honor. Dignity. If you got that, you don&#39;t care about that kind of thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So does that make you less afraid, or are you still afraid?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less afraid, because you feel like... In my case, I believe in God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also can sick a crocodile on me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So if I can mess with the crocodile, think I don&#39;t want to mess with anybody else who got a gun on his hand. But you know, I believe if you do bad things, you get bad things in your life. Good things, you get good things back. So do good things, and that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to get back. That&#39;s the way I feel, that&#39;s the way I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Have you been a victim ever of a violent crime?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;ve been in the past.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What crime?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, people used to call me on my phone and say, &quot;We know where your family is. We know everything about you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So extortion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extortion, things like that. Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel vulnerable as somebody who&#39;s lived in the United States? Does it make you more a target?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean from...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extortionists, or criminals, or...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From people in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if I feel it from people from the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico, from people in Mexico? Because I have been in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, this sort of thing can happen to... Not everybody, but there&#39;s people they do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still have family living in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brothers, the ones that were born over there, and cousins that were born over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them are U.S. citizens, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. They&#39;re all citizens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So brothers and cousins, you said?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cousins, uncles. They&#39;re already retired in the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have they come to visit?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They try to come every year, but the last few years they don&#39;t come because all this things going down over here. Who wants to come, who wants to come? Stay safe, or-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they&#39;re not coming to live in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. They used to come for vacation, but they don&#39;t come anymore with all this crime down over here and all this things going.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to be safe. They want to be in a safe place. They don&#39;t come back. They don&#39;t come down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you follow what&#39;s going on in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#39;m a person who tries to pay attention to everything. I pay attention to the news, and read.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you follow-- through talks with family and friends? Through social media, through TV, through radio, newspapers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, internet now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internet. You get everything right there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which social media do you check?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facebook, but I think that&#39;s a big thing going around Facebook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you might return to the United States someday?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah, I&#39;m a birder. I want to see the birds all around the country, and I don&#39;t leave my country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it would be just to visit, or to live?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, just to visit. They got a lot of birds over there that I really want to see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got my property. I got home. I got work, can live. That&#39;s the reason I never tried it. Oh, I tried it once, to go back when I was a kid. Younger, maybe in my sixteens, or... But still there, never again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sort of, tell me a little bit about what you remember from the U.S.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My school, my teacher, my partners, everybody. I think I remember everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you like the most about the U.S. and what didn&#39;t you-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are cool, they&#39;re great. Schools, friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was great about schools?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot better than down here in Mexico, for sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got everything. Books, technology, nice teachers. Everything&#39;s a lot different over there than here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember any teachers in specific?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don&#39;t got the name of one of them, but I remember her face, and... I remember everything, but not the name. I don&#39;t remember the name. She was real nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made her nice? What did she do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way she-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or she.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used to talk to us, and the way she does our class. It was real nice. She was nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have lots of friends there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I used to do a lot of exercise, and we used to do a lot of drawing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative). That&#39;s what give me a lot of chance to make a lot of friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. W</span><span>ere</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;your friends Mexicans, or were they...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, no. I got friends from Mexico, I used to have friends from the States, from the same neighborhood. We used to walk every day to school. Especially, I used to walk with my friend Michael. He was from the States. He was American. We used to walk to school. In the afternoon we used to stay for soccer. We used to play soccer in the afternoons, him and other friends, other friends that were from Mexico. I used to have friends-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you go to Michael&#39;s house?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He used to spend nights in my house. I used to spend nights on his house. It was something nice. Haven&#39;t seen him before, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You haven&#39;t seen him since?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I never.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you on Facebook?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m on Facebook, but I don&#39;t remember his second name right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my god.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember his name, his face, but I don&#39;t remember his second name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh god.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so that&#39;s a big thing. It&#39;s hard to find him again. Well, might not be hard, but I never try to see if I can find him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you were in the States, were you a sports fan?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I used to do a lot of kind of art and things like that, but I used to be a good runner when I was a kid. Not a good soccer player, and basketball, and things like that. I was more like a good runner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you watch sports?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. My dad never let us to see sport. As soon as we went back from school, back to house, it was homework and studying, studying, studying. Then dinner and bed. Then early in the morning, next day we have to go to school and... It was more like studying, studying, studying. That&#39;s the reason I never got involved in gangs and things like that. Neither my brothers, it&#39;s the reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think it&#39;s because of your parents?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s thanks to my dad, for sure. Yeah. He was a hard guy. He used to work a lot. He used to leave our house six o&#39;clock in the morning, five o&#39;clock in the morning. He was back at nine o&#39;clock in the night. His only day he got free, he was always trying to teach us about homework and things like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he must be pretty proud of you now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well we&#39;re proud of him. He might not be proud of us, but we were proud of the way he used to act in the past. He&#39;s still a real strict man, and he&#39;s almost 70 years old right now. He&#39;s real, real strict. He doesn&#39;t stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he must be pretty proud that you&#39;re in university, and </span><span>you&#39;re</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;studying ornithology, and...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s a kind of guy, he doesn&#39;t show what he feels and things like that. He&#39;s real, real strict.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about your mom?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom and Dad, they want a divorce when we were kids. Soon as we get back to Mexico when we were kids. It was when we got back to Mexico around 18 years ago. They went and divorced, and my mom lives in Rosarito. Rosarito Beach, by the border of Mexico and the United States. That&#39;s another story. That&#39;s a big thing too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that was hard for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well yeah, I was 11 years old when that happened, so it&#39;s a big thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you stayed with your dad?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to stay with my dad, yeah. Everybody went with my mom, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why&#39;d you stay with your dad?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s because, I think... My mom was living away with all my brothers. It was hard for me to see my dad by </span><span>himself</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand. Did they fight when they were in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope. No, it was a good thing. Well, the good stories I know about by family still now, it&#39;s about... I think the good things I remember about my family, it&#39;s about being in the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause things kind of collapsed afterwards?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, as soon as we got down here. It&#39;s a big story going around in the family, but that&#39;s many years ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that ever make you wish you&#39;d stayed in the States? Did you ever think that as a kid coming back, that things would have been different?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have our own power to do the right and the bad things. Doesn&#39;t matter where you live. I liked it down here. I got those three brothers that were born in the States. Soon as everything happened, they went and ran back to the States. They wanted to take me one time when I was a kid, and I accepted. Then I learned... That they catch me at the border, I try to jump over it. I learned that you could be happy wherever you want to be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened when they caught you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they got me and they got all my information, and they released me down by the border, in Tijuana Then I just walked back to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By yourself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I was like... Well, I don&#39;t need the United States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you in that time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 I think. Around 16, 15, 16. So, I just came back to my town and start working in the fields again. Then I got this... I was already working, volunteering in the crocodile farm before that. I came back to my town over in San Blas, and I started doing the same thing I used to do before I tried that. Then I got this guy who wanted me, he offered me this opportunity to come to Puerto Vallarta to work like a guide. I was like, why not? So I came to Puerto Vallarta, that was a few years ago. Started making a living.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to know about birds already, mammals and things like that. Then I went back to my town, and then they offered me... Because, I was tired about seeing all these things in Puerto Vallarta. Big things in a lot of people, a lot of people fighting for money. Lying to their self. I was like, I&#39;m better at my town. I went back into my town. Then they offered me again to come down to Sayulita. That was when I was 18 years old. I&#39;ve been in Sayulita for almost 14 something years already.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I used to do a lot of kind of works here. Hardware, construction, garden. I used to work in a grocery store. Then I found that there was a lot of people asking for birdwatching and things like that. I was like, well, I know a lot about birds. I grew up with animals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what kind of guided tours do you do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialty is birdwatching, thats what I do the whole year round. Birdwatching, hiking, and wildlife photography.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wildlife photography. And where do you... From Sayulita, you mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In here, yeah. I got my own email, my website, my email, my fan page on Facebook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what, you go for a day?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half days, but I do have clients that go for the whole day. I got clients, they go for a whole week and I will take them all around the state for birding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what kind of birds do you see here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well we got... Depends on through the area where you go is the kind of birds you&#39;ll find. We got water birds, songbirds, prey birds. This time of the year, you&#39;ll see endemic birds and resident birds. Then the rest of the year, it depends on time of the year, you&#39;ll see migratory... It&#39;s a whole ... birds are a big thing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if we went out now. If I said, I want to go with you on a tour, what would you do? What would we do? What would you suggest?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sure one of my favorite spots, areas near from Sayulita, it&#39;s south from here. Five minutes on the same coast. We&#39;ll see around 35, 45 birds. On this time of the year, for sure, we&#39;ll see around 35, 40 birds. It&#39;s more about nest. It&#39;s the nesting season right now, so it&#39;s birds you&#39;ll find here the whole year round. Endemic ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a good time to go bird watching, or no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well, there is some. There&#39;s a big community of birders, so I do have clients that want to come on this time of the year because they want to learn about the birds we have here. They want to learn about the nesting season. They want to know how they act and things like that. But, it&#39;s less clients than October on. December is the best time of the year to come birding here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ll see all kinds of beautiful birds in the area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about seeing crocodiles?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well to see crocodiles, we have to go north from here. Two hours to San Blas. We&#39;ll see a lot of crocodiles over there. Beautiful crocodiles, too. They&#39;re nice. A little bit aggressive and prehistoric, but they&#39;re beautiful and nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;ll talk about that again. We&#39;ll keep in touch. So have you been watching what&#39;s been going on in the U.S. now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, everything&#39;s getting crazy. Just like here in Mexico. Just Like that. I got a lot of my friends, 30% of my friends or 40% of my friends, they&#39;re from the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portland, Oregon, Washington, California.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they live here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they own properties in Sayulita, and some, they don&#39;t own properties. They just come every year. They stay here for four months and then they go back. That&#39;s what all they do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what do they say about Trump? What do you think of Trump?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I might not be the right person to talk about Trump, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re anonymous here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we&#39;re living in... I think once you stop feeling respect from other people, because... We&#39;re going too fast. I don&#39;t think 50 more years in the future, we&#39;re going to have this planet the way it is. If we don&#39;t stop being in-respectable with other people, or other countries, we&#39;re not going to have a home planet. It&#39;s a home for everybody. If we don&#39;t respect that and we don&#39;t do something about it, 50 years, or maybe less than that. The way it is right now, 50% of the people live on this planet is going to die, or they won&#39;t have a way to survive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stuff at the border, what do you think?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the border, I think it&#39;s...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, as somebody who&#39;s crossed it twice. What do these images make you think?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s United States property. If they want to make a wall, it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s their country and it&#39;s only them, and they have to think for their people. But, I think there&#39;s other ways to do it without being so aggressive or so mean, like he&#39;s doing it. Or the way he&#39;s acting. I think, we&#39;re going to make a border here in Mexico to quit people from going through. But let&#39;s do it the right way. Respectable, you know? Because, what is the way he&#39;s doing it? It&#39;s being aggressive with the other countries. Sometimes it&#39;s not our president, the one that he&#39;s saying bad things, because our government doesn&#39;t give a shit over his people. Which is me and my friend and his family, my family, and other people. Our governments, our presidents, they don&#39;t give a shit about us. They just want to make sure they got money enough to fly away into other countries. They don&#39;t care. They don&#39;t care about us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&#39;s okay. Things are other ways to make the things... Like, I got friends in Mexico, they go every six months and they work over in the States and Canada, and then they come back. I mean, you can do the wall, but you can say, you know what? We need 500 people for six months. Then you get five, 600 people work over there for six months, five months, and then they&#39;re back. Then you make money. You make what you want over there, and people here make money. I think it&#39;s the same way in Mexico acting with El Salvador and other countries in South Mexico. I think it&#39;s okay. If some day Mexico says, well, you know what? We&#39;re going to make a wall over here because there&#39;s a lot of people jumping, I think it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like I say, there&#39;s other ways to do the things. It&#39;s like, Oh, I&#39;m going to make a wall. Don&#39;t worry, El Salvador, we&#39;re gonna need people because our people don&#39;t work. Or they don&#39;t work hard, like your people work. So we&#39;ll need every year, 10,000 people from you for six months. They&#39;ll come into Mexico for six months. They make better money than in Salvador. And then, they just go back, and they make the living. I think that if the United States do something similar, some Mexican people won&#39;t feel bad about all these bad things he&#39;d been talking about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I say before, they say bad things about Mexico and he&#39;s offending and being a bad person with Mexican people because our presidents, our politicians, they don&#39;t give a shit. They just want to make money, and boom. Flying to another country. And who&#39;s the ones that really get affected? That&#39;s us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. So if somebody asked you, a friend of yours said, look. You&#39;ve lived in the U.S., you&#39;ve gone across the border. Is it worth going to the U.S.? What would you say?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a friend, a Mexican friend said to you, look, should I migrate? Should I go and work in the U.S.? What would you tell them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll tell them that, in Mexico, there&#39;s money. You just have to work hard. You don&#39;t have to go into another country. You just have to work hard and try to be better every day. Right now, it&#39;s a slow season. I&#39;m working in the construction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m working on the construction right now, and I&#39;m going to be working like that for three more months. Then the high season come, and then I don&#39;t work on that. I work on birding. Then slow season comes again, and then I&#39;ll work on construction again. You just have to work hard and then you don&#39;t have to go anywhere else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when do you find time to study.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, for 12 hours a week I go to school.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I end up my work at five, six o&#39;clock afternoon every day. Still have four hours before I go to bed, four or five hours. So I can do all my homework, go to bed, wake up tomorrow at seven or eight, and go to work. I mean, you just have to work hard and that&#39;s all you have to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your father taught you a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my father teach me more than that. I think I was, before I went up to the States, I used to help my grandpa. My dad&rsquo;s father. I don&#39;t know if there is a word nanche, it&#39;s a kind of fruit we have here in Mexico. My grandpa used to own around six </span><span>hectares</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of this fruit. When I was a kid, I used to help my grandpa pick them up every morning before I went to the States. I came back from the States and my dad, he bought a farm. We used to raise, we have a pig farm, pork farm, and we had around 70 or 80 cows. We used to plant every year around four or five </span><span>hectares</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of corn, and a lot more </span><span>hectares</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of mangoes and banana trees. So, we used to work a lot when we were kids.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my dad and mom got a divorce. A lot of my brothers... When my mom had quit, I stayed with my dad. I used to do a lot of work helping my dad. So, when I decided to run away from my house, the work I could make over here, it was so easy compared to what my dad used to put us to do. We used to wake up every morning around five o&#39;clock, in my 11 years old. I used to go to school. I used to be at eight o&#39;clock at my school. It was 8:20, 8:30 every morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you worked as a little kid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I used to stink like a cow, or pork, or pig.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the kids at school make fun of you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a lot of fun. So this is not a big deal being by myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh dear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lamberto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can handle it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well thank you so much for talking to me, it&#39;s wonderful to meet you</span></p><div><p class="c16 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c15"><tbody><tr class="c3"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
