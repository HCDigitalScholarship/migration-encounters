So I&#39;m Claudia, and I&#39;m interviewing... could you please say your name?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yobany_____.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool, thank you. Okay. So you&#39;re also welcome to talk, if you have to use Spanglish or you cuss or something, it&#39;s all good. And I did want to start by thanking you again for coming here, and I understand and I know that sometimes telling these stories can be very painful and can bring back suppressed emotions that can make you uncomfortable or sad or all that, and I do apologize if that&#39;s the case. But I do think that your story is really important for us to hear and to tell the rest of the world so that people finally begin to understand the realities that migrants face and the realities of the situation, so thank you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So, yeah, we&#39;re just going to get started, and my first question for you is, how old were you when you first came to the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was actually, I was six years old, and I was taken to the United States by my parents, because of course the pay here was a lot </span><span>better</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>tha</span><span class="c1">n what they pay over there. So, first, my dad actually went. My dad split first, he&#39;s the one that left the country, Mexico, and went and crossed illegally, and after that he raised up money to bring me, my mom, and my siblings, which are my brothers and my sisters, or my brother and my sisters. And, yeah, that&#39;s pretty much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And how was crossing the border?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, to me it was kind of weird. I remember I was young. I remember my mom said, &quot;We&#39;re leaving this day&quot;, and I just remember... I don&#39;t know. I remember being a little kid. I didn&#39;t really know much, I just remember we were going with my aunts and we turned the States, because I remember a month before they had sent us a tape about there, they were, I think Yosemite Park, which is in California. It&#39;s a national forest, and they sent us a video of when they were under the waterfall, so we&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, that&#39;s amazing. That&#39;s beautiful&quot;, you know? Me and my sisters were all amazed. &quot;We don&#39;t see that here, we see&quot;, we call it the riverbeds, you know? The dirty water. I&#39;d be like, &quot;Oh, my God.&quot; That&#39;s what we see out here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we saw that and we decided... well, actually my mom was not supposed to, we were not supposed to leave the country, we were supposed to stay here. My dad was just going to go and work and send us money. But when we saw that tape, we got all excited. My mom decided to sell everything we had over here to kind of get for the coyote, you know the people </span><span>in poyero</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and to get money for that, and also my dad sent us some other money so we could go ahead and cross over illegally. So I remember that day that we were leaving, it was like 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the house was empty already. I remember my mom said, &quot;Come on, get in the car. They&#39;re going to take us to the airport because we&#39;re going to go to Tijuana.&quot; And I remember just, I had forgotten something. I told my mom, &quot;Wait, I forgot something&quot;, so I went back in the house and I just remember looking around and I just saw the house empty. That kind of got me. I remember that instant imprinted on my mind. Then from there we left to Tijuana. We arrived at Tijuana at night. I remember we stayed in a hotel. This guy meet us up at a hotel. Actually, this guy, we meet up in a, it was in a market. I think it was... I forgot. It looked like a grocery store, like a big grocery store, I remember the guy met us there and my uncle met us there, too, but he has paper he carrying. He used to live in the States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we met up with the coyote and then he told us, &quot;You&#39;re going to be staying at this hotel. I&#39;m going to come pick you guys up at this time at night so we can go ahead and cross the border.&quot; So, I remember I was just staying at the hotel. I remember I took a nap, woke up. The guy knocked on the door. He gave us, I guess, some, what do you call it? He gave us some identification, so he gave us an ID. He gave us three of them. I remember, oh, my little brother was barely born, he was only like months old. I remember we dressed him up as a girl. Yeah, we dressed up my little brother like a girl because we had a cousin in the States that was born over there that was the same age.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they crossed my little brother with my uncle, my uncle crossed him, and so it was only us. It was me and my mom and my two sisters, and so we went ahead and I remember that night, the coyote came, he gave us our IDs. And I was just like, I remember when we got up to the line, he exactly told us what to say. He was like, &quot;Were you in Mexico&quot;, I mean, &quot;Why you came to Mexico for?&quot; And we were like, &quot;For a pi&ntilde;ata, for a party.&quot; I remember he just looked at us, he started saying, my mom said, &quot;For a pi&ntilde;ata&quot;, and the immigration officer went ahead and gave a look to us. He started seeing our names, or the names that were on the IDs. I remember raising my hand, and then that was it. He went, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I remember just looking over to my mom and telling her, &quot;Mam&aacute;, estamos en los Estados Unidos?&rdquo; And my mom goes, &ldquo;C&aacute;llate, c&aacute;llate!&quot; From that I just remember crossing. We got into a trolley, it was like a two four trolley that goes from, I think, San Diego all the way to California to </span><span>La Placito Olvera</span><span class="c1">. So I remember we got there. They came and picked us up, and we got to our new place and we were amazed. We were like, &quot;Wow, this is so much different. Yes it is.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before to recap, you flew from here to Tijuana-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... where you met up with the coyote, and he took you through the border in a car or something?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, walking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then when you got to the US part, that&#39;s when he gave you the IDs and you did all that process?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, that was before.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was before? Okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He gave it to us-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... when we went to Tijuana. No, that&#39;s all right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, no, I&#39;m just like, because I hadn&#39;t heard of the identification thing, so I&#39;m trying to understand a little bit better how that fits into getting.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you crossed it walking.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. And how long did that take you guys?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably on the night because it was nighttime. It was probably like 3 o&#39;clock in the morning, so took us about two, three hours. We were standing on the line just waiting, waiting, waiting. And knowing me as a little kid I was just playing. I didn&#39;t really know what was going on until those little parts that really hit, like me crossing over and asking my mom, &quot;Hey, are we in the States&quot;, and she was, &quot;Shut up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We&#39;ll talk later on.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t get us caught.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so yeah, tell me a little bit more about your first day. What was those impressions that you had, if you remember?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just remember a big, nice house. Of course, we&#39;re Mexican, so we kind of lived like five families in one house.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I know they say that&#39;s a stereotype, but unfortunately it really kind of is, sometimes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I&#39;m Puerto Rican, I know. I understand, don&#39;t worry, I understand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you understand. So yeah, it was all my aunts, I mean, all my mom&#39;s sisters, which are like seven of them, except for two of them that were living in their own house already. So we lived in a four-bedroom house. Each one had their room, I remember, since we got there. There was a back room as well. My uncle stayed there, and then we had the living room. So I remember just getting there, got to this big house with a big, nice front lawn. It was really, really nice to see a change, because here in Mexico you don&#39;t really see lawns. You don&#39;t really have a</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">como dicen aqui?</span><span>&nbsp;(How do you say it here?) a </span><span class="c1">patio. And if it is, it&#39;s all, how do you call, concrete. So out there when I got there, that was a big change.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, what else? I don&#39;t know. So much different. It was like... And it&#39;s the same when you come from over there over here. You be like, &quot;What the heck?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at it like</span><span>&nbsp;George Lopez</span><span class="c8">, I don&#39;t know if you know </span><span>the comedies</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like, &quot;Do people really live in those houses?&quot; You know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be, I mean, I&#39;m just saying it because I really, really thought that was like, wow, this is a big, big difference. It really is.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely. And did you have your own bedroom, or did you share with one of your siblings?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I shared it, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shared it, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And how was that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was all right. I mean, you get used to it, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get used to it. It&#39;s like everything, you get used to everything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You remember anything other than the lawns, or like from your room or something specific that you really liked about the house?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something I really liked about the house that we had a big orange tree on the back with </span><span class="c1">an hamaca (a hammock).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, a swing. So I remember the first time we got there and all our cousins were there, so I have a lot of cousins because all my aunts, so we have a lot of cousins. All my cousins greeted me. I felt kind of weird, but then I guess as all kind of the oldest one I got to get along with them and we became really, really close family, actually. We&#39;re really, really close out there and which is not the same out here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I&#39;m guessing that you went to school-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... in the US.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what was school like over there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, at the beginning it was hard because of course I did not know English. They told me that the tests, I cannot take them in Spanish, they had to be English. A lot of people used to pick on me. I used to get bullied a lot because I did not know English, and then... I don&#39;t know. I remember this one time actually, I remember I used to love Power Rangers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at my age, I guess the kids over here were like, &quot;What? This guy&#39;s still watching Power Rangers.&quot; So they were like, &quot;What?&quot; And I remember my mom bought me a toy for Christmas, she bought me a Power Ranger toy, and I carried it with me everywhere. I used to take it to school. And one time I took it out in class and all the kids looked at me like, &quot;What the heck? This guy&#39;s still playing with Power Rangers.&quot; So, yeah, that kind of. And then from there I used to get bullied a lot. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no. And do you remember any of your teachers or any kids or other friends that may have helped you in that transition, or were you for the most part just yourself?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was just myself pretty much for like the first two years, because then after that I started picking up English right away because I really wanted to learn it, just so I wouldn&#39;t get picked on, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think that&#39;s what helped out me a lot, the whole... I mean, and a part of it, it kind of helped me to get bullied because I wanted to learn English fast.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah, that was pretty much it. It was pretty much my own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so did you, speaking now more generally before continuing, what was your best and your worst experience in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My best and my worst experience?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My best experience could have been me getting my first job and being able to help out in the house, and my worst was, well, getting deported.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You could say that. Yeah, because I left back, I mean, my family. I left back my family, which is my mom, my dad, which I love my dad a lot, my sisters, which I miss them a lot, too. I mean, sometimes you think about it and you get depressed. Well, actually I do. I try not to and I try to stay as busy as I can, but when times are rough, I don&#39;t know, you don&#39;t have your dad or your mom next to you, that kind of hurts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t talk the same way to your aunt or to your </span><span class="c0 c8">primos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;(cousins) or whatever as you would with your mom or you really have something bothering you or something. I don&#39;t know. You get stressed out and... but, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so I guess, what was that job? What was your first job? What made it so great?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my first job, well, I started kind of working on my vacations. I started working on my vacations and I remember I started cleaning up a body shop because my dad&#39;s a mechanic, and everything I know about mechanics I learned from him. And right in front of where we lived there used to be a mechanic shop which my mom knew a lot of people because my mom&#39;s always been a hustler. I mean, she&#39;s always so... yeah. My mom&#39;s, she&rsquo;s always sold clothing. My mom had two jobs. She worked in the morning, she worked at night. My dad worked all day. So, we were practically home by ourselves.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my first job was cleaning up a body shop, and I liked it &lsquo;cause I was able to buy myself whatever I wanted. At 15 years old I was, I mean, I didn&#39;t have nothing to do at home but be a troublemaker. That&#39;s why my mom told me, no,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">llevanse a este nino porque es un hijo de la fregada, no le quiero en la casa</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;(take this kid </span><span>because he is the son of mischief I don&#39;t want him in the house) so </span><span class="c0">me llevaba</span><span>&nbsp;(so they took me to the) </span><span class="c1">body shop. And I used to help out this lady called Linda. She was a really nice lady, really, really nice. They were actually US citizens. And I got to meet some Filipinos there that were really, really nice as well. They were also US citizens already. But yeah, I liked it because I got to buy my own things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you buy with your first paycheck?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought my dad some shoes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aw, what kind of shoes? Do you remember?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they were some working boots, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s so sweet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I really, really remember that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awesome. And in your survey, you mentioned that you went to school until like half of the senior year?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, senior year. That&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you stop going to school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was never really into school, and, I don&#39;t know. I was really always like, I don&#39;t know, a troubled kid. I was like </span><span class="c0">el desmadre</span><span>&nbsp;(the mess)</span><span class="c1">. But-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what ways?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not violent, but just, I would not pay attention in class, always be horsing around, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So actually, I got my second job, and that&#39;s why I quit school, because I was making, what, I remember the minimum was like $7.25 and I was making $9.25, so I was making really, really good money. So that&#39;s why I decided to quit school. I thought I was going to last there, but unfortunately, you know, life changes. You make dumb decisions, and... yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So talk to me about that. How old were you when you came back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, when I came back to Mexico was, I was, what, 27 years old? Yeah, 27 years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how did you end up back here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, like I say, you make dumb decisions, and, I mean, I got addicted to meth. I was addicted to meth for about eight years. Got into some trouble. I started selling meth just to support my own habit, and you know, you hang around with the wrong crowd, make wrong decisions, which now I&#39;ll be like, damn, I was such a idiot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you comfortable sharing any of those dumb decisions? It&#39;s okay if you&#39;re not.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not really.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay. But can you tell me at least a little bit about how you got caught by immigration, ICE, or-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, actually, I got, I actually ended up in jail, and then from jail, that&#39;s when immigration went and picked me up in the jail. They put a hold on me. They didn&#39;t release me to the streets. After I served my time they actually went and picked me up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. So, did you have a court case before? When you put into jail did you appear before a judge or whatever?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when I went in jail?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They gave me a-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you had a trial?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then how long were you in jail before? How long was the sentence?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentence was about a year and a half.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after you completed the sentence, that&#39;s when they took you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And what did they do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just went ahead and picked me up from jail. On my release date they went inside the jail. They didn&#39;t release me at all anymore, they just put me in a different holding tank and they were like, &quot;Well, you have immigration hold. You got </span><span>to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;wait until immigration comes up, picks you up.&quot; And they gave me my clothing, we got dressed. We waited until like 12 o&#39;clock at night, and then from there we got, no, the transportation came in. They took us into the immigration center for processing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it you and another person, or was it you alone?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was me and like five other guys.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So how long were you in the detention center and how was that like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was actually a lot more calm because there&#39;s not a lot of politics. Like in jail there&#39;s a lot of politics, but it was a lot more calm. It was nothing but </span><span class="c0">razas</span><span>&nbsp;(mexican person) </span><span class="c8">nothing but </span><span class="c0">paisanos</span><span>&nbsp;(hispanic person)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;pretty much. A lot of ethnicities, Chinese, Filipinos. You got from Samoa, African. So I thought it was a really different experience. It was kind of weird. But I stayed there for about two months, it was like two months and a half in order for me to see a judge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). And the judge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you were given a voluntary departure, according to your survey?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And what did they do the day, drop you off at the border? What-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, they told me, they didn&#39;t even tell me the date I was going to get deported, they just went ahead and they were like, my court date was over. They took me back. I think it was like a two-hour drive-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... from court, yeah, or something like that. It was like an hour and a half or something like that, to get to court. I remember we got back. After that I remember right next day, they called me right before lunch. They were like, &quot;Yobany, you&#39;re rolling it up. You&#39;re going home&quot;, or, &quot;Your ride&rsquo;s here...&quot; Because it was, I remember it wasn&#39;t immigration because they usually have an immigration, they have GEOs, but these were sheriffs, so they were like, &quot;Roll it up.&quot; So, I rolled up my stuff, everybody was like, &quot;Oh&quot;, everybody. Because you get along with everybody, and it&#39;s not like jail, like you got to be... no. And there&#39;s a lot more chill. Everybody&#39;s just trying to go back home or trying to get their sentence or see what happens.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, when you&#39;re in jail you get your sentence and you know how much time you&#39;re doing, and that you&#39;re going to get released that day. And here, no, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. There&#39;s people in there fighting their cases for two years, three years, and they still don&#39;t get an answer, so that&#39;s what it is. But when they called my name everybody&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s good. Eat some tacos when you get to Tijuana, and definitely.&quot; So that&#39;s what I did. I remember they had us waiting for like two, three hours without food. Yes, they had us in this little holding cell. We had some people in there that were African, so they were going to send them I think to Texas, and then from there they were going to get on a plane on the way to Africa, so takes another month for them. But they were just going to place them in another holding facility.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember for us right away the little bus came, picked us up. It picked up, let&#39;s say like eight, ten of us. No, it was a van, actually. It was like ten of us in the van, and we&#39;re all handcuffed from feet to hands. It looked like a metal box. I remember we took two hours to get to the border. When we got to the border, they went and knocked on this little door. I seen a Mexican officer open the door and say, &quot;Yeah, bring them over.&quot; I remember they pulled up, they brought us out. They gave us our stuff. What I really remember from that time, too, that I guess one of the guys didn&#39;t know how to speak English so there was this... I know he was Asian because he had Asian features, and he was telling them to back up to the wall and the guy didn&#39;t know. He just stood like that, and this guy pulled out his gun, &quot;This is immigration&quot; the police pulled out his gun and pointed at him and started screaming at him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all got mad and we&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, he doesn&#39;t know what the heck you&#39;re saying. He probably doesn&#39;t even know how to speak English.&quot; They were like, &quot;I don&#39;t care.&rdquo; And then the Mexican police guy came out and he looked over, and that&#39;s when he looked. He put it away and then one by one we crossed the metal fence and that was already Tijuana. And I remember they processed us, they gave us an ID so we could hop on the airplane cause you know they ask you for an ID here to hop in the airplane or in the bus. So, they asked for our name, birthday, where we were born and all that, so we gave it to them. Then after that we came to another place where they let you make a call. They give you food, and they offered to pay half of our bus fare or not our full bus fare. The second day we were not able to get half of the money. Offered us a job even when we&#39;re staying in Tijuana.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, yeah, man. After that I remember just crossing. I already had people. I called my mom. She has people that have papers that live in Tijuana, so they came and they had papers, so they crossed. They brought me some </span><span class="c0 c8">maletas</span><span class="c1">, they brought me some money. I got on the bus. I took a tour towards Mexico. We went to Navojoa, went to Sonora, then from there to Mazatlan, then from Sinaloa we went to Culiacan Sinaloa and to Guadalajara, and then back to Mexico City. That&#39;s the only thing I liked when I got deported.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole, got to see Mexico. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the US officer PUT down his gun when the Mexican officer came.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, he did. When the Mexican officer looked over, because the Mexican officer, I guess they cannot cross, but he just stuck his head out the door and he saw what was going on, and that&#39;s when the immigration officer looked over, he just pulled it away. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so what was it like coming back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange, man, strange. Weird. You feel like you don&#39;t belong. You feel lost. You feel like... I don&#39;t know. You just feel lost. You can&#39;t find your way or &nbsp;tienes que ser un chingon. [Spanish]. Como dicen. (you need to be a badass) You know what that means? Like a parrot&#39;s always going to be green no matter where he&#39;s at, so it&#39;s kind of the same. But to me it was kind of... it was hard at the beginning, and then all my school papers when I was trying to get a job, it was in the States. Transcripts, I had to get. That was the hardest part, trying to get my paperwork, and since I didn&#39;t have my paperwork they wanted me to start all over, cause I needed my papers from school in order for me to start a job here. So I needed to start from the first grade to try to get my school papers or some type of papers in order to show at work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were you able to?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, finally I got a friend that worked where I work and kind of got me in there. It was like just go to school for two, three days, get a permit, and they</span><span>&hellip; </span><span class="c0">como se dice</span><span>&nbsp;(how do you say)</span><span class="c1">? Like to prove that you&#39;re going to school and that&#39;s it. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you came back you just went straight to work and stayed at work?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I stayed a month at home searching for a job. I actually never thought of call centers. There were so many call centers in Mexico, and I was surprised when my first job I was so happy, r</span><span>elieved</span><span class="c1">, that I had a job. You know, I messed up so much in the States, let me go ahead and try to change things around a bit, make my parents proud of me. But yeah, man. I was a month, then after that I got a job.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how was the call center? Did you like it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it was the best call center I ever been to.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I could go back. Unfortunately, I got greedy, tried to go somewhere else and I messed that up, so.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you currently work at another call center?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Call center.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what do you like the most about call centers?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, uhh, the people, man. You get to meet a lot of people. Since the place is so big you get to meet a lot, a lot of different people. Not just that. Yeah, that&#39;s it man, cause dealing with customers is not good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re always angry. Yeah, that&#39;s it, the people, man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And did you... sorry. Did you find anything, it could be a feeling, a material thing, anything that you can come up with here in Mexico that you also had in the United States? Did you find anything here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Everything&#39;s different. I think everything&#39;s different.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything in every way. It&#39;s not the same. It&#39;s not. I mean, it&#39;s not.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what do you miss about over there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents, my family. Pay, the pay, how much the dollar&#39;s worth out there. Out here either you buy yourself some shoes or you pay your rent. Either you go partying or you get me? Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would you go back to the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would you recommend people migrate?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would. I definitely would. Yes, I mean, this is the land of opportunity, so yeah, I think I would.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you believe that whole thing?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do. Yes, I do. You really go there to work and not to mess around and go to work and keep a straight life, yeah. You&#39;ll make it out there. You&#39;ll definitely make it out there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in what ways do you think that having been in the United States shaped who you are right now and your beliefs?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, just in what ways? School, man, English, it taught me English, which out here if I wouldn&#39;t learned no English and a drop out student with no type of school history here in Mexico it would have been so hard. It would have been really, really hard to... Rent, I could make it with the money I make. It&#39;s not minimum, so that&#39;s, you know. I noticed what people make out here in this... I&#39;ll be like, how do people live out here with that amount? You know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s really, really hard. Yeah. I mean, what it taught me is English, but that&#39;s, yeah. It&#39;s better from out there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I don&#39;t mean to pry or be nosy but who&#39;s </span><span>Joaquin?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that&#39;s my dad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dad?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s my dad. That&#39;s my dad, yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell that he&#39;s been very impactful in your life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah, I think if it wouldn&rsquo;t have been for him I would have been either dead or locked up for life, yes. Either/or.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about him inspires you the most?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s </span><span class="c0 c8">trabajador</span><span class="c1">, he&#39;s a hard worker. He&#39;s one of the Mexican dads that all they go out there for is work for their family, pretty much. That&#39;s to find a better life, because I guess things out here were rough, but, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Hard worker, man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. I guess those are my questions, my basic questions. Is there anything else that you want to add?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. I actually, what you guys are doing out here, I know you guys been a lot of help to us coming back to our country. You guys help us out a lot and I truly, truly appreciate that a lot. I think that&#39;s wonderful, because, I mean... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just, you find we&#39;re like a little community, deportee, we&#39;re like a little community. To find someone that speaks English and has been out there and know what life is out there or how it&#39;s really, really good. Especially when you&#39;re in a country that, like me, been away for 20 years and come back, it&#39;s like a totally new world, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yobany:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.
