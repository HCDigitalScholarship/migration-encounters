I&#39;m Jorge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Cool. So first, obviously, I want to reiterate that I understand that sometimes recounting these stories can be very painful and bring about certain emotional feelings, and I apologize deeply-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[inaudible 00:00:26].</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... for that. But we understand and we believe that your story is incredibly important to tell the world in order to help shed light on the experiences of migrants, and especially returning migrants, and help people understand the realities of the situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yeah. So my first question for you is: how old were you when you came to the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was three years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you remember anything about growing up in the United States? Remember what it was being a kid there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I do. Well, it was nice in the beginning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a lot of friends in my block. There was a lot of things to do, a lot of parks to visit. We used to play in the streets, things like those. So that was when I was a kid. I had my birthdays over there, yeah. And I think it was nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And you went to school in the U.S., right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what was that like? Did you have any friends or teachers that you met that really impacted you and that you remember still to this day? What was that experience like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, yes I did. I remember, yeah, I went to school there. And in the beginning, it was a little difficult because I didn&#39;t know any English and my peers, other students, they all knew English already. So it was a little difficult for me, and I think as well as for the teachers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I remember, yeah, that they used to give my parents reports like, &quot;Okay, he needs to learn a little bit more English,&quot; and things like those. But yes, I also remember some teachers that were very nice. I remember they used to... They always helped me a lot with my English and just with my personal attitude. So yeah, I did receive a lot of help when I was a kid over there. That was a nice thing from over there because... Yeah, for example, there was this teacher, Mr. Garcia.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was Mexican also. So I think because of that, he used to understand me. So he used to help me out a lot with my homework. He used to give a lot of feedback to my mom that, &quot;Okay, this is what you should do. You shouldn&#39;t do... Study this and study that.&quot; And that&#39;s how I got to know a little bit of more English.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice, awesome. And speaking more generally, what part about living in the United States did you like the most and what part did you dislike most?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thinking about it now, I liked that everything from over there, like the streets, the stores, the clothes, the shoes, everything was nice, especially the food also, the hamburgers, the hotdogs, the American style, all the restaurants. Not only the American styles, but right there around the city where we used to live, there was different restaurants: Brazilian, Salvadorian, from Puerto Rico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different types of foods, right? So I think that was nice about it. Everything was nice. The people were also very nice. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My neighbors. I remember I had a lot of friends over there that were from Mexico also, or also from the United States. I had all types of friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think that was nice about it. But now that I&#39;m grown up, I think that I didn&#39;t like, at the time, the system that was there-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... in Los Angeles. It was a very corrupted system because it was just meant for you to fail. In this case, I remember that, for example, if you were a minor and if you got caught doing graffiti or painting... That was very popular over there at the time when I was growing up, graffiti. So that&#39;s like street art-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... but that was against the law. So also, if you smoke marijuana. Of course, the crimes, right now, I can&#39;t say nothing about that because I think that&#39;s right. If you do something wrong, then you should pay for what you did, right? But I&#39;m talking about other things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they had this system where you... Basically, if you get caught one or two times, or even jaywalking or throwing trash, or something like that, if you get caught one or two times, you go to court. So you go to a judge and they give you a first warning, &quot;Okay, this is the first warning.&quot; Then, if you go twice, they give you community service. So you go to parks, you clean them up, or you go paint walls, things like those. But if you get caught three or four times, then you go to juvenile hall. They send you away from your parents and you go to juvenile halls. And it&#39;s like a trick because you go into the juvenile hall and you&#39;re there for six months. But in there, you&#39;re always going to have somebody that doesn&#39;t like you, from another race, black, Chinese, white, whatever. So there&#39;s always going to be a commotion, more than nothing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&#39;s meant for you to fail because inside, if you fight one time or two times, they give you written warnings. If you fight three or four times, they send you back to the judge and the judge gives you more [money 00:06:07]. So that&#39;s another fail because that&#39;s the thing over there. It was very popular to fight, to think that you had the best shoes for the town, and just let go.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So once you come out from the juvenile hall, you do your time and it puts you on probation. So what does that mean? That means that you have to report to an officer every month. They do a drug test and they do exams. If you fail the drug test, then you go right away back to juvenile hall, or if you don&#39;t go to school, or if you&#39;re having bad grades, they send you right back to juvenile hall. And the second time, with more time. Not six months now, nine months. So it&#39;s like it&#39;s just meant for you to fail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you ever caught up in that, or did you have friends who were from neighbors?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I saw a lot of friends-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... who went to that. And yeah, I also lived it once, but with that time, I learned from it. And I-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you elaborate on that if you&#39;re comfortable explaining.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, of course. No worries. What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your experience? You said that you-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... also experienced it, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because I used to love doing graffiti, doing street art. So I got caught a lot of times and they send me to juvenile hall one time for three months. So after that time...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... I did my three months, but inside, I saw a lot of fights. At the time, in Los Angeles, there&#39;s this gang thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of gangs. So the peers from juvenile hall, they had a lot of enemies. They used to fight. It was like, they saw one and they just fight right away. So they used to get in trouble and I used to see how they used to send them back to court and they used to come back with more time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yeah. That&#39;s-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how do you think those three months shaped you and your experiences in the United States and coming back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think it affected me because... Well, it&#39;s something that you don&#39;t forget. It&#39;s something that you don&#39;t forget and that you always have in your mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No worries. Bless you. But gambling, I think that it&#39;s just in your mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It affects you-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... forever. Going off of that, did the other happy experiences with your friends and in your community... Did that also have a positive impact? Did that help you in any way throughout your years in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. It did, of course, because having a good friendship and having good people besides you, it always makes you think about something before doing it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&#39;re going to do something bad and you have all your surroundings, you can just think for yourself now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So I think that helps.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So transitioning now into coming back to Mexico, how old were you when you first came back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 18 years old, turning 19.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, did you have a job in the United States? Did you do something?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just used to study.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used to study?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s how... Yeah. I used to study. And yeah, I had little part-time jobs, fixing houses-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... fixing tiles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you graduated high school before you-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... came back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did graduate high school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, just tell me how did you end up back in Mexico. What happened? You mentioned in the survey some two cases, or something. If you can-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... elaborate, just tell me the story of how you ended up back here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I&#39;ll be glad to tell you. Now, what happened here is that: well, one day I was over there in the United States with some friends and police officers came up to us and they arrested us, and they took us to jail, saying that we robbed this guy, this dude. And they actually put the gold chain in some... and like a watch. They put it in our possessions. They just said it was us, and they took us in because we used to dress like... You can say like a little ghetto.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to dress a little ghetto because it was popular over at the time when I was growing up. It&#39;s just the dressing code, right? I used to love wearing them Jordan on shirts with baggy pants, baggy shorts, and my friends also. So we used to be all bald from the hair.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to be bald. I used to shaved my head. It was popular at the time. So I think that&#39;s why the cops came up to us, and they said that it was us trying to... That it was us doing the armed robbery. So they took us in and I filed a case for a year and eight months in the county jail. Right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you all got arrested for-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all got arrested.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... something that you didn&#39;t do, that the police-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... planted the evidence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. They planted the evidence on us-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... and they just said it was us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you spent a year and eight months in jail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and eight months in county jail fighting the case.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. And what happened after that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what happened was that, at the end, in this case, it wasn&#39;t the judge the one that was going to decide what was going to happen to us. During that period of the case, the year and eight months, they used to tell us at the beginning, &quot;Hey, you know what? This guy, he&#39;s saying that you guys did it. We had the police officers say that you guys did it. So we&#39;re going to give you eight years, we&#39;re going to give him 13 years, and we&#39;re going to give another one 15 years.&quot; So they were just throwing time at us. They were making offers, giving us offers. So we never accepted it because we knew it wasn&#39;t us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we were like, &quot;Oh, hell no. We&#39;re not going to accept something we didn&#39;t do.&quot; Nobody accepted nothing, never, because if one of us accepted it, then we will all go to jail, right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nobody accepted it the whole time, the whole year and eight months.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened was that we had a trial. The traditional court justice over, we have the record, the people, the residents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re the ones who decide if you&#39;re guilty or not. But they were all against us because of the way we dress. My friend had a tattoo in his face. So it was... No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the stigmas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry. He got a tattoo in his face while he was in jail, while he was...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So they were like, &quot;What the hell?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, &quot;Come on. You can&#39;t be doing that. That looks bad against your case.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. So, yeah. At the end, my parents saw that the case was going really bad and they wanted to give us a lot of years because we never said nothing. The people and the judge, the court, they got mad at us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the end, they told us, if we lost the case, they were going to max us out. For example: they were going to give me 70 years because I never accepted their offers. And my friends 20 years and up, because they were saying that they were the ones who did the most, right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were doing the robbery. So we&#39;re like that. We&#39;re really shaking, but what my dad and my mom did was that they got a lawyer a month before they were going to sentence us. So my lawyer, he was a white dude. He was an American. He was very smart. And he took a look at the case. What happened was that the guy who say... the victim, who say he was robbed from us, the first day of the report, he gave the police officers a false name. He gave a different name, one incorrect last name.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he went the complete year and eight months. We had court trials every three months, every six months. We spent like that a year and eight months. And at the end, my lawyer, he told me, &quot;Hey, you know what? Your parents already paid for you. Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m going to get all of you guys out. Because of you, everybody&#39;s going out.&quot; So I was like, &quot;All right, good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s like, &quot;Hey, [inaudible 00:15:14]. We got to make a deal right now because we still had a month.&quot; He was like, &quot;Don&#39;t say nothing to your friends. Don&#39;t tell them nothing. Just tell them that you&#39;re going to be okay. Don&#39;t say nothing. Don&#39;t accept the charges, like you guys have been doing it for a year and eight months now.&quot; We&#39;re like, &quot;All right, cool.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened was that, yeah, we had a court. And my lawyer, he called these weird numbers. You know in court? You know in the courtroom?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The [inaudible 00:15:44]... I call it [inaudible 00:15:48] number 200 and something from the book, and all of this. And he was like, &quot;Okay, and I&#39;m seeing that, right here on the first day of the report, he gave a name. And now, ever since then, on the first day of the court, we had... The first day of the court. And ever since then, he gave a different name.&quot; So everybody looked at the victim and he was just like... He didn&#39;t know what to say. And the judge was like, &quot;Case dismissed. You guys are free to go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, what happened was that the victim, he made it obvious because he told them, &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t feel good. I&#39;m going to the restroom.&quot; And he went to the restroom and he never came back. The police officers got him in the parking station. And they told me like, &quot;Hey, do you want to put charges against him?&quot; And I was like, &quot;Nah, just let him go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Wow, that&#39;s-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they let us go. Me, well, because I was a Mexican, ICE came for me at night. The fucking police officer-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... from ICE, he came up to me and he told me, &quot;Hey, you want to fight your case?&quot; And I was young and scared. I wanted to go home already. He told me, &quot;Every time you go to see a judge from ICE, it&#39;s every six months and the case lasts for two years.&quot; So I didn&#39;t want to be in jail no more. And of course, knowing the federal jail, even though they say they give good food and everything-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... I was like, &quot;Hell no, I&#39;d rather be outside than be in jail.&quot; So I told him, &quot;Hey, you know what? I will sign voluntarily and I [inaudible 00:17:20] my country.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just to make sure that I&#39;m getting on track, after the case for the robbery, the robbery was dismissed that same... You were the only Latino in the group?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, from my-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, from your friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. From my two friends, yeah, I was the only Mexican and the other ones, they didn&#39;t get deported because-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... they were born over there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And so, that same night, or that same timeframe, same night when the case was dismissed, the ICE came for you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. ICE came for me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like literally the same night, or-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the same night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That same night, they came from me. And the next day, in the morning, I was already being deported.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Okay. And so, you signed voluntary departure. And what was that like? What happened? What did they... How was the process after you said like, &quot;okay, then I&#39;m going to go voluntarily&quot;? What-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened next?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I signed that night and they told me, &quot;Okay, since you already signed voluntarily, you don&#39;t want to fight the case,&quot; because they were going to transfer me to a federal jail. But I didn&#39;t want to because I was like, &quot;Man, two years. I&#39;m already tired. I almost did two years fighting the case-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... and it wasn&#39;t even my fault.&quot; So I was like, &quot;Hell no, I want to go home. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s in Mexico or in the United States. I just want to go home.&quot; I had never been in jail like that before, so it was a big change in my life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened was that I went to... Okay, I signed that night and, in the morning, I was already being transferred. They came for me in the morning, the agents from ICE. They handcuffed me. They put cuffs on my legs and my arms. And they took me with a lot of deported people also losing their... I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what was their cases, but there was a lot of people who come back with me. Yeah, like a bus-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... a complete bus. And from there, I remember they took us to... Okay, from there, they took us on the bus. We pass through... I don&#39;t know what States in the United States, but we&#39;re just making pit stops.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from there, they brought me to the border. And from there, they just opened the door and say, &quot;Bye.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literally, I just walked out the border. We just crossed the gate. They opened the door for you, literally like that, and they tell you, &quot;Bye.&quot; They&#39;re in a bus. They take the handcuffs off, from the legs and all of that. And they just opened the door and they tell you, &quot;Go inside.&quot; And there&#39;s Mexican officers on the other side, of the other border, and you just walk. You don&#39;t even know where, but you just walk.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened there was that I got a public phone because I had money. My dad, before I got deported, they let my dad go see me, and he even risked it. But he took me some money and he told me, &quot;Hide it.&quot; So I took money over there. I got to put in the phone. I called them and they were like, &quot;Okay, we&#39;re going to send your uncle. But meanwhile, get a hotel real quick.&quot; So I got a hotel. I stayed there for two to three days. Meanwhile, my uncle came and then he... He came from Los Angeles to Tijuana.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from there, he took me to a big bus station, and that&#39;s when I came to Morelos to see my grandma, to live with my grandma.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what was it like coming back? What was that transition? Was it easy? Was it hard?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell yeah, it was very hard at the beginning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&#39;t even used to the food.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&#39;t used to anything. I missed everything from over there. I came over here, it&#39;s like a different culture, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like, I never got to meet my culture when I was little. I didn&#39;t know much about it. And over there, all I used to study was about the United States. And I studied English all my life and never studied Spanish. So over here, it was a little difficult to use the phones, and all of this, information.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And it was a little difficult. In my hometown, it&#39;s a different economy over there. So I think we have a better economy right here in D.F., in Mexico D.F. But over there in my hometown, it&#39;s more of rural.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of fields. They grow a lot of vegetables, those types of things. So I got to a little town... Well, my grandma lives in the City of [Cuautla 00:22:08], but I have another grandmother who lives an hour away. And over there, that&#39;s where I went to my first years, and it was a little town. And everything around her, it was just jobs in the field, like picking up onions, planting pumpkins-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... corn-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... a lot of things like those, so I didn&#39;t know where to look for a job.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very difficult for me, that my parents just send me money every now and then, so I can have money to eat food, to buy myself some shoes, or things like those. But that was my first year, like my first seven months. And after, I just met a friend over there. I saw a friend over there that also got deported. We know him because of my family. And he told me, &quot;Hey, you want to go work? Let&#39;s go over here to a tortiller&iacute;a. (tortilla factory)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was like, &quot;All right, fuck it, it&#39;s money.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So I was like, &quot;Fuck it.&quot; I went and I worked there for seven months. But during that time, in the newspaper, I saw, &quot;Hey, if you know English and you want to... If you know English, then you can be a teacher.&quot; So ever since I saw that little sign on the newspaper, I was like, &quot;okay,&quot; and that&#39;s when I started. And plus, all my friends in my town, they all had degrees, bachelors. There were teachers, or cops. So my cousins, they all have careers, so that motivated me also to keep studying here since I did have my high school diploma from over there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was like, &quot;Man&quot;... I started getting classes at 19.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Was it easy to get into the university system here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was easy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you able to use your papers from the U.S.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not directly. What I had to do first was go with the lawyer and pay him 4,000 so he can make the high-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dollars?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, pesos.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that would be a lot of money.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, &quot;It&#39;s so a lot,&quot; but-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;d rather buy a house, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;d rather buy a car with that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. At the time, it was 4,000, what I paid, so they can make my high school diploma into Mexican. It&#39;s a revalidaci&oacute;n. (revalidation)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They make it into a Mexican diploma, but they do charge you because the lawyers have to do that and right here in the [SEP 00:24:38].</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Secretar&iacute;a de Educaci&oacute;n P&uacute;blica 00:24:40].</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had to do it there. So yeah, it was a little difficult for me because I didn&#39;t have a job. My parents helped me out, and that&#39;s when I started... That&#39;s when I enrolled into the university, in a private school. I went to a private school. I studied to be a teacher. Well, that&#39;s what happened.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And how long did it take you before you were able to get your bachelors? Four years?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four years. It was a four-year career.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Are you still teaching, or-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I haven&#39;t taught for a year. I don&#39;t know, I think... Well, over there, I was teaching... Like I told you, I&#39;m going a little back in my town, in Morelos.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a different economy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I used to teach over there a lot for eight years now... for seven years now, giving classes. But they used to pay me a little bit. So I think I got this motivated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I met a friend right here. He told me, &quot;Hey, come over here. I got a job for you. You know English.&quot; And right away, they started paying me way more than what I was winning over there. So ever since then, I started working in call centers. And right now, I don&#39;t have a job right now, but I&#39;m looking for a job as a teacher again in Mexico City-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... because I&#39;ve heard from this one friend... He knows a lot also. He knows a lot about Mexico City, and he has a lot of contacts. He told me, &quot;I can get you some contacts so you could work in private schools. Those are the ones that pay good. [inaudible 00:26:08] some good money right there.&quot; So that&#39;s my goal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, to go to a private school-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... where they pay good money, like in the SEP.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like if you were working for the government.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, I wish you the best of luck with that. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll all work out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Thanks.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just a few other questions, and then we&#39;re done. Did you find anything that you had in the United States here? It can be material things or feelings, or that sort of thing. Do you feel like you had anything the same that you had over there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course... Well, not really, no. To think about good, damn. I saw some restaurants that are right here and they&#39;re from the United States, like Panda Express or things like those-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... but the food is not the same.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the same.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It tastes different. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you miss the food from-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. [inaudible 00:27:19] the food.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else do you miss? Even-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cars, you work in a few months, you can buy yourself a car. I miss that because, yeah, I did have a little car over there. It was my dad&#39;s, but I always used to drive it. So it was nice. He had a truck. He had two trucks. I mean, he still does, and I miss those things, like the cars. We have very nice cars over there, and they&#39;re easy to get-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... because you work hard and you buy it real quick. And over here, no. You work a lot and you still got to save more money, so it&#39;s a little different.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But really, yeah, just like talking about sports. Sports is something that I can relate to over there. And over here, the same passion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like with soccer and things like those.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the World Cup.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I love those things. Yeah, those are the same things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So you do still have family. Are your parents still over there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they&#39;re over there. My mom, my dad, and my sisters, they&#39;re all over there. I haven&#39;t seen them for nine years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my God.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s why I want to go back. I want to get a good job so I can [inaudible 00:28:33] my visa, and things like those.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was going to ask if you would go back. But if you would go back, how... So you would just basically want to get a job.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would need a good job first, I think.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And you want to apply for a visa?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And maybe, I could look for programs-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... like voluntary programs, or job offers where you can go from here to over there and work over there. And maybe, one weekend or, I don&#39;t know, a week, or before I come back, I can go visit them, or something like that. So, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe, I would just go illegally.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. If I got to see my family that way, then I will do it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&#39;ll be more than happy to get a good job first, save some money, so I can go. And hey, if I go that week illegally, I might as well take advantage, work one, two, three years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s a lot of plans.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So would you recommend people to migrate, to go?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, why not? Sometimes, there&#39;s things over here, like family gets sick. And, okay, you have a job, but they&#39;re not going to cover everything, you know? So over there, it&#39;s more simple to make. I think it&#39;s a little faster to make money, not simple, because everybody works hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think it&#39;s a little faster. And the money from over there, it&#39;s more over here. So in those types of situations, yes. If you have a problem, or things like those, yeah, they should go because you can take care of an emergency that way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you need a surgery, an operation, something like that in that aspect.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s pretty much all the questions that I have for you. Is there anything else that you want to add? Anything that you want to say?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I would-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is your time. Are you satisfied with what you&#39;ve said so far?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was a good interview. I even actually felt good about it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just remembering all those things, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was a nice experience.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, thank you so much then.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jorge:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.58fae85fc1d07e1493d51db806e6dac2eec81174"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c5"><tbody><tr class="c9"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c11"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
