class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So this is Lizzy and Victor I are moving on to our interview now. So, I&#39;m hoping that you can tell me just a little bit more about your life in Mexico before you went to the U.S. So, your childhood growing up here, who did you live with? What was that like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived with a big family. It was like four, five different families in one big house. We were all family. I guess it was just, we were too crowded. We were poor and needy, so that was one of the reasons why my parents decided to leave the country and went to United States to live particularly. Yes, it was rough growing up. When I was a child, it was rough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever&hellip; Were you aware of violence going on around you in your neighborhood, anything like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it was. But, even in my own house. I grew up in a dysfunctional family, alcoholic family. Most of my family, my grandfather, my parents, my brothers, my uncles, my cousins, they all drank. When they drank they would get violent. And so, in my own house it was a violent environment in my own home. And it was the same as well, like, in the streets, in the neighborhood. It was a violent neighborhood. And so, yes it was a tough time. Especially as I was little, I was a short guy, little guy, so I was&hellip; you know&hellip; I guess I can say I grew up being bullied in my own home and in the neighborhood as well, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were people violent towards you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of violence?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would&hellip; I would get beat up. I would get beat up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this by family members or in the neighborhood?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would get beat up by my own brothers, by my little brother. He was always taller than me. And so my cousins, they were all, like, grown and big and tall, so they would beat me up in my house. And so when I would go out to the streets and, you know, try to get some release from home, and it was the same in the streets. Instead of having fun, playing with all the kids, all the kids will try to bully you, right? So, there was no escape. And so I would get beat up in the streets also, you know. And so that was my childhood. Messed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that something that continued once you were in the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes. It continue also in the US. Not too much at home because my parents, they had changed. They have stopped drinking when they went back to the States. So, it kind of changed at home. But, at school, it was still going on. There were a lot of bullies, a lot of violence, a lot of gangs in the schools in Dallas. There was a lot of gang activity going on. So, it was the same thing going to school. A lot of violence, a lot of gangs, a lot of bullying going on. And so, yes, I kept getting beat up in school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like you couldn&#39;t escape it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It was like&hellip; It was hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything else about your childhood in Mexico that you want to share? Any other favorite memory or a worst experience?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I remember one time my parents, they weren&#39;t there. They were not at home. And I remember me and my brother got into an argument and so the argument escalated into a fight, right? Plus, since my brother was bigger than me, so he got the best of me, right? And so he beat me up pretty bad to the point that I started bleeding and I started choking on my own blood, right? And so, I thought I was going to die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like 10 years old. And so, my brother got scared. He got spooked and he let go of me when he seen all that blood. And when he turned around, he started walking away. It seems like I went from being scared to like being shocked when I seen all that blood. I just grabbed a brick. Like, it was like I couldn&#39;t help it. I just grabbed a brick that was right next to me and I threw it right at my brother. And so, I hit him in the back of the head and so he started bleeding. And then my grandma came out the room and she saw what was going on and so she beat him up and she beat me up again right after. We were already bleeding both of us and she still beat us up and put us in separate rooms. And so, it was a bad experience, you know, because you&#39;re supposed to feel safe at home, right? But, I didn&#39;t feel safe at that time. And so, it was really rough. It was real bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds like a scary ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traumatizing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... traumatizing, yes. And I would love to hear more about, you told me swimming across the river to cross the border.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c17">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that was, I would say another traumatizing experience, because I was only 13 years old when I went to the US, right? And I was skinny, and I was a little guy, right? And so I left with my brother, with my oldest brother. He was a little older. He was not that skinny. He was a big guy, right? So, we had to swim across the river. And they call it</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c16">R&iacute;o Bravo</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;because in English it means, uh, like, the river of rage because it had taken so many lives. But anyways, we made it, right? But then we had to cross the checkpoint. We had to walk around the checkpoint. And sometimes it takes days, sometimes even weeks to walk around the checkpoint. So, you can only carry so much for food and water with you because if you carry way too much, it&#39;s too heavy, then you can&#39;t walk, right? So, uh&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, were you hungry, thirsty?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re hungry, thirsty. You&#39;re right around wild animals like hogs and spiders, rattle snakes, all kinds of different snakes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was it just you and your brother or were you with a group?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. It was, like, a crowd of like 15 different people. But, I remember we would take breaks. Like every five, six hours we would take breaks, right? And the guys that were bringing us, they would gather all the crowd in one spot and then we would eat and rest for a little bit, for about 15, 20 minutes, and we would have to keep on walking. I remember there were times where I couldn&#39;t walk no more. And I thought I was ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you are so tired or weak?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I thought I was tired, but the reality is that I was dehydrated. And so, I would just, like, fall on my knees and I would tell them to, &quot;Just leave me here man, y&#39;all keep on walking man. Like, I can&#39;t do it no more, man.&quot; And my brother would pick me up and he&#39;d be like, &quot;Come on bro, let&#39;s go man.&quot; You know, excuse my language, but &quot;You can do this shit man. You can do this shit man. Come on, let&#39;s go.&quot; And so, I would keep on walking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long were you walking? How many days?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked for like three days straight. Yeah, we walked for like three days straight. And we ran into a rattle snake at one point. My brother&mdash;my oldest brother almost stepped on it. He almost stepped on that snake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s terrifying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was tough. It was scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Sounds very scary. And were your parents already living in the US or did they come after you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. They were already living in the US, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So then you and your brother went to live with your parents in Dallas?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. When we first arrived there we moved with our parents, and then started living with them while we were going to school. Got enrolled in school and so we started going to school a few years. And then we started getting jobs and then we just move out the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like going to school in the US when you first arrived, not knowing English? How was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traumatizing. Traumatizing. Because, we didn&#39;t speak the language, right? And we still poor, so we got different outfits in school, you know? Busted shoes and clothes with holes in them and stuff like that. So, kids would make fun of us and they&#39;d call us wetbacks and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the teachers like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers were cool. They were good people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have a favorite teacher?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I had a couple of them&mdash;favorite teachers, yeah. [inaudible 12:30]. Ms. Campbell. I remember Ms. Campbell. She was a white lady. She was cool. She taught me how to speak English. I learned a lot from her. She was cool. She was different from a lot of people. She was humble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What grade was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in eighth grade. So she was one of the first teachers you had when you arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. She was one of the first teachers. I had some more teachers that were cool, I just don&#39;t remember their names right now. But yeah, I had some teachers that were good people. I remember.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have any role models, people that you looked up to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a role model, but I guess it was the wrong kind of role model.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were some of the things that you looked up to him for?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was not afraid to die, and so I just, like, wanted to be like him, you know? And so, I put that on my mind. I set that into my mind and my heart. I was not afraid to die, like my father. But then my father had, even though he stopped drinking, he had, you know, anger problems. And so, he would fight a lot, and he knew how to fight. So, you know&hellip;When I arrived to the US, I wanted to be like that too. And so, when people started bullying me at school, I started getting into a lot of fights. It was like I just got tired of it. And so, I started getting into a lot of fights. I wanted to be like my dad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had learned that from him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about your mom? What was she like? Or, what is she like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is she like? She&#39;s a Christian lady. She&#39;s a Christian woman. She&#39;s a good example to me. She got her own company now. She working on becoming a US citizen. She&#39;s just a role model now, for me. I guess the best word I can use to describe my mom, the best role model that I look up to now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often do you get to talk to her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite often. Every other day. Yes, we have good communication.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When was the last time you saw her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I saw my mom was like four months, four, five months. No, like six months ago. Somewhere around there, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has that been hard, being separated from her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. A little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we talked in the survey a bit about the workplace raid, what led to you being deported. Could you walk me through a little bit more? What was going through your mind or what were you thinking and feeling when that was going on?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was traumatizing. It was traumatizing because there&#39;s like&hellip; there&rsquo;s a lot of things that are finna to happen in your life, and a lot of unexpected things that are finna to happen, and you have to be ready to cope with those unexpected things. And sometimes you don&#39;t know how to cope with them. But then you have to be ready to deal with the circumstances. And so, it could be traumatizing, right? It could be frustrating at times. It could be confusing. It could lead you to make the wrong choices in life, right? If you feel frustrated, if you feel angry, when you feel confused. And so, I was not expecting the unexpected. And when it happened, it just shocking, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you see it coming at all?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I kind of did, you know? But, not like that. Not like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you said you&#39;ve been back in Mexico for two months now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months. Going on two months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s it been like these past two months? What&#39;s life like for you now here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is beautiful, period, to me. But like, at first, I mean, it could be traumatizing if you let it, right? If you let it, it could be traumatizing. Because, you don&#39;t know a lot of things about the country, even though I&#39;m born here. But, I don&#39;t know a lot of things about the country, right? And the people can tell I&#39;m not from here because of the way I speak. They say I got an accent also when I speak Spanish, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You mentioned before that you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant, that you don&#39;t feel as safe here because of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes So&hellip; You know, I tried to go get my birth certificate and the lady that worked behind the desk, the clerk, she tried to get money from me, right? And I was already... I was already&hellip; it&#39;s like, people have warned me about that, right? And so, when I went there, they told me before I went there, I already knew I was not supposed to pay too much for my birth certificate, right? But, I guess somehow she, well, I&#39;m just assuming, right? That somehow she, like, heard my accent. She&#39;s like, &quot;Man, he&#39;s not from here.&quot; Somehow, right? And so she tried to get all this money from me, right? And then I just told her, &quot;Man, I appreciate it man, you have a nice day. But, I&#39;m good. I&#39;m not going to get it right now.&quot; And so, I went somewhere else and got it for cheap, really cheap.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Spanish 00:21:24] sometimes when I walk in stores, markets in the street, and they try to sell things to me for way too much, because they can tell I&#39;m not from here, right? I don&#39;t know. They&#39;re like, &quot;I can probably get a little extra change from him. Since he&#39;s not from here, he don&#39;t know the prices.&quot; I&#39;m just assuming things, but it goes on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;ve heard a lot of people say that. One thing I&#39;ve heard a lot of people say is that they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re fully from either place. Like, they don&#39;t feel fully Mexican or fully American. Would you say that&#39;s the case for you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, because sometimes when I&#39;m speak English, people also say I have an accent. Either you&#39;re from Texas. You have that accent. When I lived in other cities, like in Gladstone, Missouri, or in Kansas City, Kansas, people would say, &quot;Hey man, you&#39;re not from here, right? You&#39;re from California? You&#39;re from Texas?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m from both. I&#39;m not from Texas but I grew up in Texas.&quot; &quot;Yeah I can tell. You got an accent, right?&quot; And I don&#39;t mind. My English is not a hundred percent perfect, right? And I don&#39;t have papers and I&#39;m not a US citizen. I was not born over there and I&#39;m not from there. But, I feel like I&#39;m not from here neither, right? So, to a certain point I feel like I really try hard, strive to not lose my identity, right? Trying to find myself, who I am inside. That&#39;s how I feel, like I&#39;m not even from here, and I&#39;m not from there. So, when they ask me, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; I just tell them sometimes I don&#39;t even know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s very powerful. What would you like to be able to say when people ask you that? If someone asks you where you&#39;re from, do you want to be able to say, &quot;I&#39;m Mexican or I&#39;m an American&quot;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I was able to say ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or both?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I was able to say I&#39;m from either Mexican or American. But I&#39;m from the city. I grew up here. I was born here. I live here. This is my community. This is my family. This is where&mdash;you know? But I don&#39;t have that. I don&#39;t have it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s really hard. If you had stayed in the US, what do you think you would have done? What were your plans for your life or your hopes there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would probably&hellip; I would work on becoming a US citizen. Maybe even buy me a house. You know, just save money. Maybe one day own my own business and teach my kids how to make it in life. Be a good role model for my daughter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, on the flip side of that, now being back here in Mexico, what are your hopes now for your life in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hopes? My hopes? They&#39;re pretty high. They&#39;re pretty high. Because I believe that I might not have the tools or the resources to getting a certain kind of job, a good position. But, I do possess something that all the people don&#39;t have in this country. And that&#39;s the language. It&#39;s the English and Spanish, which most people call it bilingual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingual. You&#39;re fully bilingual.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, I can get a job using my English, right? Because, that&#39;s what, people&hellip; that&rsquo;s what some companies, they probably need bilingual people. And so, I&#39;m willing to use what I have, right? And put it into work. How, I&rsquo;m still not sure, but I know something will come up. And when it does, I&#39;m going to take advantage of that opportunity to the fullest. And so, I&#39;m willing to grow, right? When a door opens up, because eventually it will, and I believe it will. A door will open up, and when it opens up, I&#39;m going to take advantage of it to the fullest. And then I&#39;m going to look for another opportunity to grow. Not only financially, but physically and mentally. So yeah, my hopes are pretty high right now. Even though I&#39;m in Mexico, but my hopes are pretty high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about family? Do you hope to have more kids? Do you hope to get married? What are your hopes as far as that goes?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more kids. No more kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any contact with your daughter?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do. Yes, I do. She loves me. She loves me. I love her. We communicate often, way too often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. That&#39;s great. But, you said too often.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I guess it&#39;s a little too often. Yeah. Yes. Sometimes I&#39;m trying to do things and she text. She text messaging or she calls me when I&#39;m trying to do something. Or sometimes I call her and just message. I&#39;ve been doing the same thing. Maybe she&#39;s trying to do something also. I guess it&#39;s a good thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Sounds like you both love each other. When was the last time you got to see her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really hard. I can tell you miss her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do. Yes, I miss her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s been&hellip; If there is anything, has there been any good things since coming back to Mexico? Has there been any positive experience or what&#39;s been the best part about being back, if anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. There&#39;s been a lot of good things in my life since I&#39;ve been back in Mexico. It been bad and there&#39;s been good, but I choose to look to the good instead of the bad. Because, I haven&#39;t got robbed. That&#39;s a good thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is always a good thing. Yeah. What else has been good?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to a job interview last week, quite a few job interviews. But, since, like, everything&#39;s been looking good, so I&#39;m going to start probably working this week, next week. So, that&#39;s a good thing. I have a place to live. For most people that grow up in the States and they get deported, they don&#39;t even have family in the States and they don&#39;t even have a place to live, you know? Some people don&#39;t even speak that much Spanish, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I have a place to live. I have a warm bed at nighttime. And so, that&#39;s a good thing. And so, I see this as a good thing also because also I&#39;m deported. Y&#39;all don&#39;t know my situation. I probably haven&#39;t aten in two or three days, right? I probably don&#39;t have money to eat. Y&#39;all don&#39;t know that. But, I&#39;m going to get 200 pesos, right? I&#39;m able to eat something with that, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you know you&#39;re going to get a lunchbox here too, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes, that&#39;s a good thing. And so there&#39;s lot of good things that have been happening in my life. A lot of good things. Can&#39;t complain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like that. I can tell, you try to take a positive outlook to your life. Has that been helpful with everything that&#39;s happened, getting deported, trying to keep a positive attitude?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes. Yes. I believe that&#39;s what opened up that door for me on this job next week, you know, staying positive. Striving as much as I can to keep that positive energy. It is hard, but it&#39;s possible. It&#39;s possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a really great attitude to have. I bet it&#39;s hard sometimes though, to stay positive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s hard at times, yes. It&#39;s difficult. Yes, it&#39;s very difficult. Knowing that, you know&mdash;knowing that at points in my life, when I was a teenager, I wanted to be like my father, right? But my father had a negative attitude. But, at that time I thought he was a good role model for me. But he was a wrong role model. And so, I started having that wrong attitude, negative attitude, you know? I was being bullied in school and then I got tired of it and I started fighting. And so, that was for short period of time in my life where I kept that attitude, that negative attitude. But then I realized it wasn&#39;t going to take me nowhere in life, right? And so I started working on it. When you start working on it, you realize that it just don&#39;t go away just because you wish for it to go away. You have to work on it every single day of your life till you die, till you hit the casket. So, I&#39;m willing to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a lot of work. So, my last question for you as we start wrapping up, one thing that we&#39;re trying to figure out is ideas for what can the government do? What can the government of Mexico do, or what can the government in the US do to help people like in your situation? Because we feel like people like you who have lived it, you&#39;re going to have better ideas than me, or any of us, or the president or someone else who hasn&#39;t been through it. So, I guess, what do you think could be done differently on either end, in Mexico or in the US, to help things, to help people, to make things better for people getting deported or return migrants?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Victor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the government has already done its part. Because, I know people, and even family members that have been deported in the past, right? And they shared experiences they had in the past while getting deported. And they didn&#39;t mention, I remember they never mentioned the help. I got this when I got deported from the government. You know, we got food&hellip; You know, they have shelter for all the people that get deported. They help you with a little bit of money. They give you a discount for a bus ticket if you&#39;re traveling, going far. And so, I believe the government has already doing its part. But I believe they can still do more. You know, maybe create some sort of programs for people that get deported, for immigrants. Some sort of programs to show them how to cope with the country, with the circumstances, with when you feel vulnerable. But I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;m asking for too much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s asking for too much. What about on the US side? I know you&#39;ve mentioned Donald Trump a couple of times.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c3"><tbody><tr class="c18"><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c5"><span class="c2"></span></p></div></body></html>
