I guess we can start by just talking about why your family left to the US.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. As parents, every parent looks for a better future for their children. They had a certain type of education, background. We&#39;re from really the suburbs, small town where the economic or the economy for the family comes from the fields, basically from corn fields. This is small, not like in the US where they have crops and crops, or really more of a commercial type of work. They just thought that if they could not provide more economic opportunity by being in town, by the limitations of their experience, or they saw that this was the best opportunity. My dad went and came back to the US, worked, and then talked with my mom to go with him. They left us about two years, for the same situation. They just basically took us over there to have an education. They used to say, &quot;If you go to the US and you learn English, you&#39;re going to have a better opportunity even if we cannot, in this case, send you to the university.&quot; That was their idea. That was basically, I see it as the reason that they took us over to the US.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your first memory of the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving really early in the morning. What is it? Like, 2:00, 3:00 AM, and going to a McDonald&#39;s to get something to eat. My brother, one year younger than me, and he&#39;s like ... We&#39;ve never saw or have heard or even been around hamburgers, so he got his hamburger and he&#39;s like, &quot;Mom,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c7">esta torta no me gusta</span><span class="c1 c3">&quot;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;[laughs]</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;[mom, I don&rsquo;t like this torta] Nothing, or too far away from what it was. It was a hamburger. That was one of the first memories that I remember when actually crossing over the border and in this case, experiencing being outside of my hometown, because I mean, the furthest that we used to go would be to ... This town is like 13 kilometers, what is it? Like a couple of miles, three, four miles, approximately, from the city. That was the furthest that we were exposed, or that was the closest to a city that we were exposed to. It was on occasion that we went over, so we were really not into the city lifestyle, opportunities, or just ... I mean, I never thought that I would see traveling as something that is feasible, easy to do, and it&#39;s a bridge, really. I think that that&#39;s part of the reason that they took us over and that is one of the first memories that I remember when we went over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you were there, did you start school right away?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that was the first thing. Yeah, I mean, next day. The second day that we were there, my mom ... At that time my mom didn&#39;t work, only my dad, so they took us ... She took us to school and right away we started school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are the people that you remember from school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher, Ms. Lopez. That was my first teacher, and then a friend that I met over there, which is Louis </span><span class="c1">Madrigal</span><span class="c1 c3">. I even remember his name. Well, my name is </span><span class="c1">Obdulio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Lopez, so they couldn&#39;t pronounce my name, so he&#39;s like, &quot;Maybe we should call you OB,&quot; and I was like, &quot;Why?&quot; He was like, &quot;Because O, as in O, your first name, and then just the B. Make it easier.&quot; From there, my nickname became OB. Then everybody, &quot;Obi Wan, Obi Wan,&quot; so everybody knows me now. I haven&#39;t even watched the Star Wars movie so I really have to see what or who they&#39;re referring to. I mean, that&#39;s comical because I mean, everybody knows but me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were calling you Obi Wan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s funny. Why do you remember Ms. Lopez?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was that transition from ... I mean, totally different. A small school, the elementary school where I went to here in Mexico, in Oaxaca, I mean, it&#39;s just ... There was this fence, chain link fence, and I remember that my grandma and my mom, when she was here, would take us tacos. </span><span class="c1">De huevo</span><span class="c2 c1">, just like that, over the fence, and then just pass us our lunch. It&#39;s from night and day. Over there, we have our cafeteria. We have our breakfast, we have our lunch. I mean, that was a totally different experience, and on top of that, this teacher, which is Ms. Lopez, was the one that was my teacher for ... Basically, she received us, or at least in this case, me, with other students that were just fresh over there. I guess it&#39;s just that first encounter and it was a really pleasant one. She was really helpful. That&#39;s probably why I have that memory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ended up going to school, graduating from high school, and going to get an associate&#39;s in engineering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, specifically </span><span class="c1">CISCO</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;networking. Networks, all this. I like IT, so that was part of what I wanted to do, so yes. That, then I did air conditioning. I mean, I did a little bit of business. I wanted to go to ASU. My idea was to do the MBA at ASU, so I started taking the courses that you can take over to ASU. What do they call those? The common ones that are on the first year, like English, Biology, Psychology, all of those. I took classes because I got a scholarship to go to college, and in this case, that was the idea, but then I came to a wall when you needed a social security to continue education. That was, so, whatnot. Then, I had a friend that went through hoops and loops and everything, and he actually did graduate from ASU. However, once he graduated and got his title, he could not work as what he studied for, so he went out to work in construction. That kind of puts you down a little bit. Okay, so, that is why I started doing entrepreneurship and I went towards the business type of working for myself, which was also a great experience, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were ... Would you say your story is normal for people that are undocumented?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be. I think that it might be different. My mom was always in meetings for school. My dad would always sleep in the car, and then, I don&#39;t know what happened, but one day he started going to the reunions, parent reunions, because I had younger brothers and sisters, or, a sister and brother. They became part of a board, so the people that were working with them on this migrant type of little board started sending them to universities to conventions, to make them better. To motivate them, so they started talking to us, asking ... Oh, when I used to express myself as, &quot;I would like to do this,&quot; my dad especially would say, &quot;You&#39;ve got to change that.&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m going to do this because I can. It&#39;s not if I can. It&#39;s, because I can, I do.&quot; Right? I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Starting this at, what was it? 10, 12, 13 years? That started to stay in my head, so today, I know a lot of people that say, even here, that the economy, and probably you heard this. The economy, the weather, politics, everything is wrong, but they do not take ownership of what it is, or responsibility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to make us better, so I mean, in that sense, I think that I can say that having that exposure and not having all those resources kind of, with the support of my dad and mom as a way of thinking, that made me a little bit, not too ordinary. I see most of the people even here, it&#39;s just ... It&#39;s everybody&#39;s fault, and it is not. It&#39;s our responsibility. I mean, if you want to go to school, you can. Right? That is part of my purpose right now, is to continue education. Right now, I found this opportunity</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;i</span><span class="c2 c1">n high school, when I started doing high school, or when I started going to high school, I had the opportunity to, I mean, get to know a lot of people. There was an Upward Bound program, and they had these stipends for to motivate you. That was one of my first experiences, where that, I saw it not really positive, because you didn&#39;t have a social, you could not go in there. Where is that stimulation to be better, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a migrant son and my friends being migrant, there were a couple that actually cared for school and studies, and they started having these special activities that I didn&#39;t have access to, so that kind of, oh. I started to play in a band at 15, a Mexican band, and then I started not really caring for school. I was part of the Upward Bound ... Not the Upward Bound, but the Closer program. I was in the migrant club in high school, so we had the opportunity to go to Washington, DC. We went for two weeks, so we had this exposure for current events, and then politics. Got to go to the White House, the Capitol, Washington ... All of this, tour, and a lot of people from different countries. From Cuba, from Poland, from ... I mean, we just were a mix down there, and that kind of gives you more of a different way of seeing life and education. I mean, that&#39;s the whole difference. If I had remained in my town, hometown, they&#39;re what? 19, 20, they&#39;re already with their girl, with two, three kids, just drinking. That&#39;s part of the hobby down in the small town. I mean, who&#39;s to blame? At this time, I see that they actually ... I thank my parents for sending me over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">there was people that were just drinking and having children. Why do you think that is? Why do you think they did that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s the environment, I guess. I mean, if their parents did it, then us as young kids, they&#39;re smoking, they&#39;re drinking, and then they&#39;re getting their girls pregnant. Lack of much, I guess, motivation, or somebody that can open their eyes to what I have seen. I don&#39;t see it that way. When I came back from the US and went to Oaxaca, I had some savings and I started spending this. You have no idea, because the peso, [inaudible 00:13:03]. Then, I actually started, I built a warehouse, started doing [foreign language 00:13:12], and started trying to work. My grandpa passed away, so my grandma had some properties where I tried to kind of do what he did, but no. I&#39;m not a farmer. I don&#39;t know. I had to employ people, and it wasn&#39;t something that I really understood. I was just spending money just because, and got to a point where, I mean, I found the opportunity here in Mexico for a call center, which was ... I mean, it wasn&#39;t much, but then I really had to start getting some income.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, as far as what other people&#39;s experiences have been in the US, I hear a lot of discrimination. I hear a lot of, more of the, all the things that are wrong. I think that ... That is the reason that I was asking about this program or this research that you guys are doing, because I mean, having some sort of leadership development program, as far as mindsets for people that come from those places, I mean, it is already a decision that we can take as own. My sister got together with her firstborn, and he was ... I mean, he was actually a resident, but he came from a background, from parents that were separated, and really, I don&#39;t know how you can change that. He was already 25. She would talk to him, into thinking different, and that&#39;s something that&#39;s not going to change, from one day to another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the elephant, right? When they start training them really slow, they put this little [foreign language 00:15:06]. What do you call that? Where they tie the little elephant down and it&#39;s just like a hoop. He tries to get away, he moves, he moves, and then he gives up. When he&#39;s really big, he can just lift his foot and then just walk away, go free, but it&#39;s just that conditioning of the mind, that he just feels that that is his destiny, to stay on there. Just to stay at that place, and that&#39;s how we are. I mean, I see really different, or interesting. I try to look at the half glass, how can we say? Full?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glass half full?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glass half full, instead of the other way around. Yeah, so I don&#39;t know, as far as your interviews, or what experiences, but I mean, I&#39;ve heard really, really a lot of stories that ... I mean, they&#39;re really just bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, for you, led to your return to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially? Okay, so I was detained because ... It was really funny, because I took the truck from my brother, and we had just bought that truck, and he got the permit but did not put it on the plate. I just put it inside, and I started driving. I mean, driving good, nothing happens. Then, a highway patrol, a sheriff saw the plate, that it was already expired, so he pulled me over and he&#39;s like, &quot;Do you know why I pulled you over? What happened? Your license plate is already expired.&quot; &quot;Oh, I have it here.&quot; &quot;Okay, so </span><span class="c1">get down</span><span class="c2 c1">.&quot; He ran my name, and, &quot;Oh, your license?&quot; &quot;Well, I don&#39;t have one.&quot; &quot;Okay, so do you know that I can take you in for grand theft? Whose truck is it?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s my brother&#39;s.&quot; &quot;Do you know that I can take you in for grand theft auto?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not your truck, is it?&quot; &quot;No, it&#39;s my brother&#39;s.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Then, you stole it.&quot; &quot;No, I didn&#39;t steal it. I mean, we live in the same house. I mean, if he needs to take my car, or I take his. I mean, that is family trust. I mean, there&#39;s no issue with that.&quot; &quot;If my brother took my truck, I would send him to jail.&quot; &quot;I respect that, but that&#39;s a different situation here, but call him up. Just call him and ask if I really stole his truck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he actually did call him and he was like, &quot;I have your brother here, and I&#39;m going to take him in because he stole a truck.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m not filing charges, so you cannot do that.&quot; &quot;Okay, so I&#39;m going to impound the truck.&quot; &quot;Why are you impounding the truck?&quot; They got into this little argument, and he&#39;s saying, &quot;Oh, well, because I can.&quot; We had those type of situations, but nothing that cannot be resolved, so I was just like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then, that was when I got arrested. The judge told me, &quot;Your driver license?&quot; &quot;Oh, you know.&quot; I was kind of ashamed that I didn&#39;t have a social, didn&#39;t want to say that. I said, &quot;Oh, you know what? Yeah, I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot; &quot;Yeah, right now you should be out there, not here.&quot; They took me in at 12:00, or at noon, and then at 8:00 they were releasing me. Then when I was going out, &quot;Oh, wait, wait, wait,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Obdulio</span><span class="c2 c1">. No, you&#39;re not going now.&quot; ICE. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Then, from there-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were just after your court hearing, you were walking out the door to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, basically. Well, they had me locked up for a couple hours, but at the time of going out, they said, &quot;Oh, you have a hold from ICE.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh.&quot; They took me, and then I didn&#39;t know I had ... I paid for a lawyer, which, it was really funny, because, &quot;What am I here for?&quot; Come on, come on. We didn&#39;t pay for the best lawyer, but I mean, I still was expecting that if you&#39;re a lawyer, you know what case you&#39;re going to go for, or at least you did a little bit of research. Then, imagine you being the lawyer and asking your client, &quot;What am I here for?&quot; That was upsetting, but I mean, I was taken in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You lawyer didn&#39;t even know what he was</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;doing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that was the worst. I mean, not knowing if you&#39;re going to go out, if you&#39;re going to be deported at that moment in time. They tell you that if you don&#39;t sign, you&#39;re going to stay locked up forever and ever. I&#39;m like, &quot;Really?&quot; I wasn&#39;t-</span></p><p class="c12 c17"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. Then, yeah, so. Then, at the time of my hearing, the judge was reading my file and he was reading another name. &quot;Are you ... &quot; &quot;I&#39;m not.&quot; &quot;What do you mean you&#39;re not?&quot; Then the lady lawyer was like, &quot;Oh, my bad.&quot; They use copy and paste templates, so they messed me up. That left me another weeks, two, three weeks, still detained with immigration. Then, my wife at that time basically worked with the lawyers to get me a work permit, and that&#39;s how I got a bond and was released over there. I was like that for another three years, but already, that is why I actually did have another job. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were released from detention with a bond, and then with a work permit for three years after? Like, you got stopped that first time, then you were released, and then you were free in the USA.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. I mean, that was the good part. I mean, but I guess everything happens for a reason and I like to think it, that way, but at the moment being there, I mean it&#39;s just this ... You can&#39;t even see the sunlight. I mean, it&#39;s all indoors and it&#39;s depressing. I mean, at least for me, it was a depressing experience because I didn&#39;t know what was going to happen, but I mean, even though it was not a pleasant experience, I think that it did happen that way. It opens my eyes to being grateful for what I do have, in this case. See, I was just visiting a friend here, and I found out, he told me about this place, </span><span class="c1">Daniel</span><span class="c2 c1">, and you guys doing this. I mean, that&#39;s interesting. I have an interesting story to tell my girlfriend now, that we&#39;re going to-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were detained, you were free again. What happened next? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a court hearing, basically. I started working with this company, for income tax preparation services, like H&amp;R Block, kind of. Then, well, I already had my hearing. I went and they said, &quot;You know what?&quot; Said, &quot;You don&#39;t have any extreme circumstance. You don&#39;t have children. You did have some education.&quot; The judge told me, &quot;If you go to Mexico, do you think that you can find a job, or?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Okay,&quot; so, decision to leave the US. They gave me a date, and then it was another two weeks to get my things ready, and then I bought my plane ticket. The idea was that I was going to come over here and, in this case, do all of that paperwork. Now being here, it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, you have to wait 10 years.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really haven&#39;t looked into what I was told and what it is, because right now, I mean, I&#39;ve got many interesting things going on here in Mexico. When I got the interview with AT&amp;T, &quot;Are you planning on going to the US?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;It may be a possibility, but not right now.&quot; I mean, I&#39;ve been growing in the company, and I mean, that&#39;s something that probably you don&#39;t hear over there with the </span><span class="c1 c7">paisanos</span><span class="c1 c3">. They think that it&#39;s really difficult here in Mexico. Even here in Mexico, a lot of people ... Then again, I thank my parents for the language, because believe it or not, it opened my door, just </span><span class="c1">like vroom</span><span class="c2 c1">, here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How hard was it for you to adjust to Mexico when you came back? </span><span class="c1">T</span><span class="c2 c1">o get a job here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it wasn&#39;t that difficult. I had savings, so that made things a lot easier. I really didn&#39;t have to worry about that part. When I started running out of funds, then I considered the idea of coming to Mexico, so I just, I mean, knowing the language, and I saw this call center opportunity. Just went online, they did my interview over the phone. Started looking for a place to live over here. My grandma knew somebody that would rent me a room. I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, so I&#39;ll go,&quot; and everybody&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re crazy. What you going to do over there?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m just going to go work.&quot; I mean, going back again to the environment, or who is kind of mentoring you or telling you these ideas, that you can do what you said to do. I mean, I didn&#39;t have any really big complication. I mean, knowing the city, I might have gotten lost a bit, but I mean, really now with the GPS? When I came over to Mexico, I basically got my truck back from Calexico, because my ex-wife has family in Calexico. I&#39;m sorry, in Mexicali, so I went for my truck and drove all the way from Mexicali all the way to Oaxaca. I don&#39;t know if you are familiar with where Oaxaca is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, so I made two stops. In</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Culiacan</span><span class="c1 c3">, and then she&#39;s from </span><span class="c1">Sinaloa</span><span class="c1 c3">, for about four hours. Then I </span><span class="c1">drove here</span><span class="c1 c3">, to Mexico, and then I did have that experience here with the police. &quot;Oh, do you know why I stopped you? Because you don&#39;t have a permit.&quot; &quot;Oh, I have it right here.&quot; &quot;Oh, well, this is not working, and then you were speeding.&quot; I&#39;m like ... He got me with 900 pesos. I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh.&quot; That was different, but yeah. I had to ... I drove from Mexicali all the way to Oaxaca. It was a long drive, and so I stopped here, and then from here all the way to our capital. It was different, </span><span class="c1">because of </span><span class="c1 c7">casetas</span><span class="c2 c1">. Over there, you drive away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was different because of the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c7">casetas</span><span class="c2 c1">? What are those? A toll?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. Basically you don&#39;t ... Over there, you have the risk of sleeping on the wheel, because if you&#39;re driving so long, I mean, you really get off to put gas. In here, you have </span><span class="c1">to pass through a caseta</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;every so, every place so you have to stop and then pay, and then continue. Adapting, being in the city now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you said you were in Oaxaca for a little bit of work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, doing the work for, farm work basically, but not a formal job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. How long were you doing that for?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about a year and a half. On this company where I&#39;m at, with AT&amp;T, that&#39;s two years and a half that I&#39;m with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there ... When did you decide to stop working in the field?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I ran out of money. I basically had to sell my truck. Sold my truck, I was going to have some</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c7">borreguitos</span><span class="c1 c3">, (sheep) some</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;cattle</span><span class="c1 c3">, and it&#39;s expensive. Just building, and just ... It was like two acres, for that little place,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;la muchera,</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;that I started working on. Then again, I mean, you&#39;ve got to have financing. You&#39;ve got to have a lot more money to continue that. I did also </span><span class="c1 c7">pozo profundo</span><span class="c1 c3">, the well, for the irrigation and everything. I mean, it was ... Then again, I just kind of got back to being on knowing exactly what I want to do. Part of that, working for, in this case where I&#39;m at, allows me two things.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Well, where I&rsquo;m at</span><span class="c2 c1">, and then just, where am I going right now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you&#39;re working there, at AT&amp;T ... Well, since you&#39;ve been back, was it hard to be separated from your ex-wife? Did you have children together, or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No children. It was, because she wanted me to move to Mexicali. I mean, they have some, a call center, but really as a long-term career? It&#39;s something temporary, or just ... The reason that I did not go over there was because I was planning on growing with the company that I&#39;m with right now, and I have, and I wouldn&#39;t have that opportunity down there. There&#39;s people that come from Tijuana, Mexicali, all over the country to work here where I&#39;m at. Really, right now, since this work ... I actually was, they call us waves, every group that comes in. I was the second wave. We used to go down on the </span><span class="c1">Pedregal </span><span class="c1 c3">to do the training, and now we&#39;re in </span><span class="c1">Parque Toreo</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;They bought a floor, so now they&#39;re four floors down there. There&#39;s about 3000 employees now. We just opened Guadalajara, and I was a trainer, a TA, trainer assistant. We support the groups that come from the trainer. We take them to take those calls, and then I had to go to Guadalajara. Everything paid, everything, meals, everything. The opportunity to develop more people, so right now, Guadalajara, just opened that center, and there may be another one that&#39;s going to be opening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, the growth over there, yeah. I mean, literally, they have all these different opportunities, so looking, like you were asking, &quot;Do you plan to go to the US?&quot; Maybe on the different position that I may be at, they may require me to go over there, within the same company because as you know, it&#39;s a global company, and that&#39;s awesome. I&#39;m not working in the technology field right now. I have this opportunity right now. I am with the new project for fraud. It&#39;s amazing. I&#39;m an investigator for fraud, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With AT&amp;T?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;do</span><span class="c2 c1">?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of fraudsters down there, and that&#39;s the new project that we got here. We got this increase in position, salary and everything, so we&#39;re going to make that work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like your education in the US has helped you move up so </span><span class="c1">quickly?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Education, definitely, but I mean, education without that mindset? I had a friend when I was doing this IT job, and he was going to </span><span class="c1">a program</span><span class="c2 c1">. He actually did his science, technology, one of those majors or degrees. I needed help to finish a project, and he&#39;s like, &quot;No, man. Really I just went and passed the exams to get that title, but I really don&#39;t know anything.&quot; He had that opportunity. I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s everybody, because it is not. However, it is how you think and how you ... When I was studying business and I was doing my little shop, I used to go to the classes with questions for real-life scenarios. &quot;What would you do in this situation?&quot; I would go back with my customers and put it to practice. That was interesting, really good, so a combination of the education and what mindset you&#39;re having, because there&#39;s people that ... I mean, I was having issues personally for about a year before I grew, and then it was just a couple months, six months. Six months, and that was, attendance, really important. That discipline for your attendance, and a lot of people just with that small part that we can work with, I mean, it&#39;s ... Being easy does not mean that it&#39;s not, it doesn&#39;t take hard work to do, but yeah. In this case, education did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you&#39;re back and it sounds like you&#39;re settled in and you&#39;re happy here, you&#39;re enjoying everything life has. You have a girlfriend. What is your long-term plan? What are your long-term plans?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, definitely get a, in this case, a degree in business. That is something, and I do want to pursue technology still. That&#39;s part of that, and hopefully, I mean, I&#39;m looking at this company as long-term. Right now, the idea is right now, at the end of 2020, the plan is to go to Japan. That is kind of the big-time goal basically, right now, is just to prepare us. Learn as much as we can of the language. She already speaks Japanese. She was already in Japan, so that is why. She loves that culture, most of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so in this case, it&#39;s just part of why we&#39;re going, is that. I mean, I&#39;m not closed to the idea of going to the US, but I mean, it&#39;s another different perspective because the opportunity is everywhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is here, and you see it here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s where you see it. It&#39;s where you make it basically. I don&#39;t know if you heard that little, it&#39;s like a </span><span class="c1">story and everything</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;where there&#39;s this old fellow at the entrance of a little town. Then there&#39;s this young </span><span class="c1">guy who comes</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;in, or he&#39;s going to that town, and he asks, &quot;How is this town?&quot; Then the old man says, &quot;How is it from where you&#39;re coming from?&quot; Like, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s horrible. Crime, no job. I mean, it&#39;s awful.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, son. The same here.&quot; Then another guy comes by, and, &quot;How is the town?&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;How is it from where you&#39;re coming, son?&quot; &quot;Well, people are friendly, there&#39;s a lot of work. I mean, it&#39;s really a beautiful town.&quot; &quot;Same here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the place that we&#39;re at. I mean, crime is all around us. If I start in the metro, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen those little kind of periodicals, newspapers type of. They&#39;re all gory and bloody and everything, and there&#39;s people that actually every day go and buy that. It&#39;s just like nutrition for our mind, for what we eat for our body. Right? If we start looking at those newspapers or start shifting focus on the negative or the crime, I mean, we&#39;re really in a bad place. If you choose not to and then you just focus on the good things, or just on where are you going, then basically everything ... I mean, it still exists. It&#39;s not that you&#39;re not accepting that it is, but you&#39;re just going to where you want to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. What would have you done if you would have stayed in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so ... Having the opportunity with a social, I would continue entrepreneurship and finish off my MBA. Maybe a master&#39;s, on that sense, over there. Just, I mean, continue on improving myself to be a better person and keep helping others. I like to help people, so part of me, that is why, I mean, part of the TA that I had previous to the position that I have, you get all these people that don&#39;t know how to do things, and then you teach him the correct way, and then you see them grow. Then you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, I was your TA, I was your TA, and now you&#39;re growing, so you did take into consideration attendance.&quot; They&#39;re thankful for showing the way, and I mean, that&#39;s really ... I mean, that&#39;s very, very satisfying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I was there, I would probably continue. I always, without the people that were around me, friends or people that I kind of saw in my circle that were kind of not really clear-headed as far as what they wanted to do or were just being too negative, I mean, they would tell me that I was the, what&#39;s it called? Optimistic, always. &quot;Oh, </span><span class="c1">no le ganas</span><span class="c1 c3">. He&#39;s always taking you. If you tell him something bad, then he&#39;s going to turn it around, turn it around.&quot; I mean, I choose to, and not always, not 100%, but its going that way. Maybe ... Do what? A public speaker, maybe. That was something that, do you know Jim </span><span class="c1">Rohn</span><span class="c2 c1">? Tony Robbins?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[inaudible 00:36:24].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No? [inaudible 00:36:25].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re public speakers that you listen to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Zig Ziglar? No? No?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of those guys. Sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon Hill. Have you heard of him?</span><span class="c1 c7">&nbsp;Think and Grow Rich?</span><span class="c1 c3 c7">.</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;No? All right. I mean, really, it&#39;s just-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They go to conferences. I mean, a ticket is really expensive to go, to listen to their ... Basically, they</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;brainwash you </span><span class="c2 c1">to being positive. Basically, that&#39;s what it is. It&#39;s just to focus on the positive. It&#39;s like, John Maxwell? Example is, that we should not be finding excuses. Okay? It&#39;s like, this guy. There were two friends and they got laid away, or laid off on their work. One went home and just watched TV, drink beer, fight with the wife. The other one started every day looking for a job. He went to one of the places that he would like to work at, and he wasn&#39;t, &quot;No, you&#39;re overqualified and we&#39;re not hiring.&quot; He was just looking around, didn&#39;t find one, so he came back and he&#39;s like, &quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll work for free. I mean, instead of staying at home doing nothing, I&#39;ll work for free. You don&#39;t have to pay me.&quot; Then a month or two after he was working there for free, just giving his time because he liked to do that, one of the top-level management people quit. He took that job, so it&#39;s about persistence. It&#39;s about motivating people, seeing the opportunity on what you may see that it is not there. That is what they do. They tell you, they motivate you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you think that being in the US has shaped who you are today?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exposure to so many things just makes me feel that we can do anything that we set out our minds to do. It was just eye-opening. I mean, and that&#39;s where you may ask, how </span><span class="c1">is this common</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;or not, type of thinking of anybody that goes and comes back. Well, I would hope so, but in this case, it did. I had the opportunity to go to Yosemite National Park. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been there. It&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s awesome. The field trips that the schools have, we went to Santa Barbara. We went to different places for art. We had field trips to Six Flags, Disney World, so that&#39;s way different than being here, than not going out of your town. If you talk to people that are here in my town and then you tell them, they think that you&#39;re kind of bragging about your experiences when you just want to share what you had, because they think that you&#39;re just exactly that. They misinterpret that you tell them, &quot;Anything is possible.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah, you, because they took you, right?&quot; No, I mean, you can go to school, and you can ... I mean, here, education. You can find a really, really ... Compared to the US, not expensive. Well, depending</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c1 c7">si te vas al tech</span><span class="c1 c3">, (if you go into tech) that a little bit </span><span class="c1">more </span><span class="c1 c7">billete</span><span class="c2 c1">, (costly) but I mean, there&#39;s scholarships if you want to go ahead and do so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, do you feel ... There&#39;s a question that we&#39;re asking people that come back, that have been there for so long. You spent there, 22 years of your life. Do you feel more American than you feel Mexican?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Ni de aqui, ni de alla </span><span class="c1 c3">. You heard that? Neither here nor there? At the beginning, yes. Now that I&#39;m exposed to, for instance, my girl&#39;s from</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Queretaro.</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;Okay? When you&#39;re in ... Let&#39;s say where I&#39;m from, in the little town. Transportation was not very at reach of people. Right now, it&#39;s a little bit more. You still find dirt roads, you find that. I mean, really, really low income, or not as developed as here. Even here, I mean, there&#39;s still things that are different. I mean, I had the opportunity to be in California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Washington DC, Oregon, so you have these different type ... Even in the US, you see differences, just as in putting gas in. That&#39;s not how you put your gas in. Other states, you go to Oregon, how it&#39;s always been, that you have somebody that puts your gas, just like here. Coming here, you start kind of doing the compare and contrast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess, I was talking to my girl, because she came from a family that actually did not live in the same situation that I did. She went to [inaudible 00:41:40], she already went to Europe, she went to Japan. She&#39;s been all around, and she&#39;s really humble. I wouldn&#39;t think that she would already have these experiences, and she&#39;s here, for Mexico. That is, her mom was ... She passed away three years ago. She was a teacher. Her dad as well. I mean, they have really worked hard for them. His brother, or her brother, actually owns an animation studio, and is working with </span><span class="c1">Tec de Monterrey</span><span class="c1 c3">. He is teaching there</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;He actually got some contest ... I mean, it&#39;s a little bit of a different type of animation, but still, it&#39;s something that he wanted to do, said to do, and is doing. It&#39;s like, wow. He&#39;s getting paid for that, and it&#39;s his own company. That kind of goes with me, and where am I going with that? Is that, when I go with them, I mean, they have transportation. They have really nice homes, and it&#39;s just like, over there. Versus my hometown, I mean, it&#39;s not ... I mean, you can see the difference. Then, they tell me, these family nights, family games, just over there. Their schools and everything, it&#39;s very similar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, for me, it&#39;s just kind of ... I&#39;m adjusting, and now seeing that, it&#39;s the environment that we grow in. In my experience, I mean, I wouldn&#39;t change it. </span><span class="c1">Si porque si no hubiera ido para ya</span><span class="c2 c1">? (If you hadn&rsquo;t gone over there?) Probably I would be with 10 kids, just in the town doing nothing, thinking that it&#39;s everybody&#39;s fault that I&#39;m not succeeding. I don&#39;t know. I mean, so they do a really good job in opening you to more ideas. All the programs like MESA, Math, Engineering, Science Achievement. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard of that. That&#39;s a program in high schools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that the US side or the Mexican side can do </span><span class="c1">better to</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;protect migrants like you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaning, if they have to come back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as I said before, what can they do better for someone in your situation? Just, it&#39;s broad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you heard of financial freedom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so I mean, that&#39;s where I&#39;m ... Part of where I&#39;m going is that, financial freedom. Something that is not taught in schools, right? For people, I mean, for me, the benefits were the migrant program. Which luckily, those schools had, but I don&#39;t know if all across they have that. I think independent, or in this case, not necessarily for us, but I guess for everybody is just that mindset that we can achieve and we can be better. That is why Japanese culture is ... For instance, my girl was telling me that she was in Japan, and then somebody found her wallet or ... Then, nobody took it, and then they were posting pictures on the trace to see if somebody recognized her. They actually found her and they returned that wallet. Then, there was a fair. I think it was here, that a little girl got lost, and she was holding her. She went to call, &quot;If this is your daughter,&quot; and then the mother came back and thanked her and wanted to give her money, and this. She&#39;s like, &quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, this is what we should be doing as persons. We should not be getting those thanks or getting rewarded for something that it&#39;s our responsibility. I mean, </span><span class="c1">a </span><span class="c1 c7">recompensa</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">or a reward for just doing the right thing, I think that that&#39;s so messed up in our humanity. This is, just talking about culture, and also sometimes as persons, just as persons. This is type of the mindset that she brings from over there, that it may seem logical, but yet, we have that reaction if we lose our boy or daughter, and then someone finds. Like, &quot;Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot; We just want to be grateful for that, when it should be already expected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think ... What words ... I think those are all the questions I&#39;ve got, but what would you have to say? Do you have anything else to say to finish off the interview, that&#39;s on your mind that you want to make sure is said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obdulio: </span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in this case, I mean really, thank you for the opportunity to just express my experience. I think that it&#39;s a good thing that you guys are doing. I don&#39;t know where it is at the end of the day going to be, or basically where it&#39;s going to end up, but I think that it&#39;s good. Keep it up. Keep doing that, and hopefully just the positive vibe of these type of projects or this research, I mean, it just goes with some other people maybe not in this moment in this room, but to spread that idea, of being self-sufficient. Being responsible for our development, and it is our responsibility. No one else, but it is also really helpful or it benefits all of us by having programs, in this case the US, to let us know that we can do better. If our parents gave us the opportunity, because that&#39;s most of the time, is to actually give back in examples. Somebody to follow, somebody that&#39;ll say, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re right, I can do it here, I can do that.&quot; </span><span class="c1">Pero</span><span class="c2 c1">, just thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sergio:</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your time.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><div><p class="c12 c16"><span class="c2 c8"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c18"><tbody><tr class="c4"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c8"></span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span class="c3">Page </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6"><span class="c2 c8"></span></p></div></body></html>
