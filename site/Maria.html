It was scary. It was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me about it a bit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I don&#39;t remember that much, because I was small. I was like&hellip;well, my mom was like, &quot;Oh, we&#39;re going to go over there, it&#39;s going to be prettier, and were going to have a better life.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; And my other sister was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; So we left and we was not thinking about what was going to happen or anything. We were just happy that we was going to go and visit and see how was it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you said it was scary crossing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we were cold, because we were in the desert and it was at night, and it was cold we could hear a lot of animals. And that was scary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long were you in the desert for? Do you remember?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c5">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Like o</span><span class="c0">ne night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night. And what was it like when you arrived in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c5">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don&#39;t know. It was pretty good. I was like, &quot;Oh my God, look at all those buildings.&quot; </span><span class="c3">And i</span><span class="c0">t was nice. [Laughs.] I was happy to be over there. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you like going to school there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c5">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, I don&#39;t know, I was scared and I didn&#39;t know English. I was talking in Spanish and they couldn&#39;t understand me. I didn&#39;t have friends at first until fifth grade, I guess. And</span><span class="c3">&hellip; </span><span class="c0">it was hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after that you had friends?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes I did. I had friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they Americans, Mexicans?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were all kind, because I was already learning English. So I was already communicating with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you liked school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did. I was pretty good. I had As and Bs. It was good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have favorite subjects?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Math. I used to love math over there, it was my favorite. I used to always get As or A plus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was good. But here it&#39;s hard, math now, because I didn&#39;t understand it good. But it&#39;s okay now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how many years, you said you spent 10, seven years? How long was it? I forget.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went when I was seven, I came back when I was 17, I had just turned 17. Yeah, it was 10 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so why did you come back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of my grandfather, he died. So we had to came to the funeral.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s why you came back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why did you leave, somebody died?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. When I leave, it was because we didn&#39;t have money and we were poor and my family just wanted a better life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So you came back. You left because your grandpa died, you left the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it hard to leave the U.S?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it was. Yeah. Because it was different, because when I left I was a child and when I came back I was all grown, and the city was different. So yeah, it was difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was different?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where we used to live and the people, I didn&#39;t recognize all the people, my family, I didn&#39;t know much of my family just because they... Well, my mom would just show me pictures and this, and then, &quot;There&#39;s your aunt, there&#39;s your uncle, your cousins.&quot; But it was really hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever say, &quot;I want to go back to the United States?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, yes, I want to go back. My sister came to... The one that was born over there, she came and she didn&#39;t like school. She went like, &quot;Ah, no. I want to go back.&quot; So she went back with my stepdad. My stepdad lives over there too. So she left and we stayed here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. That must&#39;ve been hard?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a sister who was American, who could leave and you couldn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you mad?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I was mad. Because then my mom left again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mom left again too? She went back to the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why didn&#39;t you go back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. She told me to stay with my grandma, because my grandma was alone. So I stayed with my grandma and my other sister.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they all went back except you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom and my sister, yes. And my other sister, she stayed with me and my grandma, we stayed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was your other sister a U.S. citizen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the one who was born in the U.S. went back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&#39;re all living... Where&#39;s your mom now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came back. She&rsquo;s living with my grandma now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did your mom work? What work did your mom do when she was in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c5">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think... I</span><span class="c3">t was like I </span><span class="c0">don&#39;t remember the name, but it was with plants, putting tags and fixing the plants and the little... Well, I don&#39;t remember how the thing called.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a store?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was not a store. Nursery?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a botanical nursery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a botanical nursery. Yeah. Did she like plants?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, but it was her work. [Chuckles]. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what do you miss most about the United States? What have you missed most?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going out to the beach, hanging out with friends from over there, going to... I don&#39;t know, it was the place that we used to go with my friends, to the movies and everything. Because it&#39;s different from here. So I think that-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s different?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, the food is different. Even if it&#39;s food from over there, it tastes different, it&#39;s not the same. But I think... Well now I got used to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what food did you like over there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pizza. Because it was like, the bread was slim and here it&#39;s all fat and only bread, and no cheese. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now you&#39;re used to it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m used to it. I like it now. I like it here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you had stayed in the United States, what do you think you would have done in your life?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work, because I couldn&#39;t study anymore or I don&#39;t know, because when I came back, they told me that I couldn&#39;t study no more over there, &quot;Just finish high school and that&#39;s it, and then start working.&quot; That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think that&#39;s the same I did here, but here is the place where I was born so...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you know you were undocumented when you were in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know you didn&#39;t have papers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed when I was in middle school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you notice?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I was talking to my mom about studying more, finish my high school, start college. But she was like, &quot;No, college is too expensive. We don&#39;t have paper, we&#39;re not going to... You&#39;re not going to be able to study.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Well, okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&rsquo;s rough. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sucks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thank you very much for talking to me.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">MARIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
