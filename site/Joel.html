And last thing I want to say before we start is just, we really appreciate you coming out to talk to us. Sometimes these stories can be hard to talk about and if it brings up anything difficult, I&#39;m sorry for that. We do think that it&#39;s something very helpful to help change people&#39;s perceptions of people that have a negative perception of migrants from Mexico in the US and hearing your story in your own voice is something that we hope can help people have more understanding of the situation. So maybe a good place to start would be ... well, talking about your life in the US. So you were two and a half when came-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was two and a half when I came to the US. I basically started school from pre-kindergarten all the way up to sixth grade. So everything there was so different when I got here. So I mean, even in school, I remember&hellip; There you could&hellip; Even on the food thing, food thing, I mean, you could eat whatever you wanted. You ate good. You dressed good. You&#39;re used to living in a good house. And here, I mean, it&#39;s rough. At school, if you don&#39;t have any money, you can&#39;t eat anything. Or if you don&#39;t ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my situation was that when I got here, I had to work and study to give my money to my mom and stuff because my dad got deported over there. So everything&hellip; everything was going down. My dad had his own store, a restaurant and another few businesses there. So I can&#39;t say I was living bad in the US. I really can&#39;t say that, but-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do ... Oh sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, go ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you felt like you always had enough food to eat in the US? You felt comfortable financially?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Everything. Everything. Yeah. Financially. Yes. Always. Always. I always felt good there. So on that subject, I mean, I have nothing to say. But when I got here, I mean, we came back because my dad got deported, but my dad wasn&#39;t living with us anymore when we got here. Basically my mom is the one that took the decision to come back because even though he got deported, we still stayed in the US for about maybe a year or so without him. But she took the decision to take us&mdash;uh, to bring us back. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what led to your dad being deported?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, I think that he was drunk driving, something like that in</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Ohio</span><span class="c1">. But I think that&#39;s the reason why. Other than that, I mean, when we got here, we were living without him. I think we still got here and we&mdash;I think we still had five years. We lived five years without them still. So it was basically most of my childhood, or half of it, was without him. So I had to work and study at the same time, help my mom and my brothers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m the oldest one. So I was the one going back and forth from school and working. So it was kind of a rough life. Also, here, something that is very, very important or something very dramatic here is ... the uhm, I mean, you can&#39;t go outside without keeping in mind that you might get robbed or something, or you might not even come back home and stuff like that. I mean, that&#39;s&hellip; that&rsquo;s something real that&#39;s going on here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, in the US, I remember that I used to go out with friends and play out at the playground, no trouble at all. Here you can&#39;t do that. You go outside, you see people doing drugs or people just looking to steal things from you and just rob you. So it&#39;s an everyday thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember when you came back here as a young teenager, middle school age, at that time, were you aware of the safety issues here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I knew about it, but I didn&#39;t know at what point it was until I got here and saw what it really is. I mean, when you get here in school, I mean, it&#39;s almost the same thing. You&rsquo;re always, even with your classroom mates, if you don&#39;t know who they are, sometimes they even do things to you too. They will rob you. I got&hellip; I actually got robbed once when I was here in middle school. This kid took, uhm&hellip; robbed my wallet out of my pocket and stuff like that. So it was kind of harsh too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of your classmates at school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Classmates, a friend, in parentheses.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So it was, yeah, it was kind of harsh too. I mean, in that thing ... Well, in my case, I didn&#39;t hear anything about that there in the US. I didn&#39;t worry about that thing in the US either. So it was kind of strange still. So I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just a different life here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first day?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any memory of that day?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much. When I got it back here in Mexico City, I just remember ... I remember me when I was at the borderline, I didn&#39;t want to cross. I was telling my mom, &quot;Don&#39;t make us go back. I don&#39;t want to go. I just don&#39;t want to go. I want to stay here.&quot; I even told her to let one of my uncles adopt me or something. I just don&#39;t want to go. So everything was different. I mean, the places, I mean, everything is just plain out different. There&#39;s no other way to say it. It&#39;s just not the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the hardest challenge about coming back? The safety? The different culture? Or school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety, school and I guess the economic thing because we didn&#39;t have nowhere to go other than my grandparents&#39; home. But I mean, for only a few years, we were good and then we were kicked out too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were kicked out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My grandparents, to be honest, kicked us out of their house. So, I mean, we had a house, but it wasn&#39;t like in living ... How can you say it? It wasn&#39;t a good place to live for a family. It was just a wooden house with a lot of things that had to be fixed and stuff, so. But that was the only place we had to go. We really didn&#39;t have that much money when we came back. So my mom took us there and lived there for a lot of years until my dad came back, actually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that living was kind of hard for me. I mean, we used to&hellip; I mean, all the houses are good in the US, or where I lived. You had all the services. Here, sometimes you can&rsquo;t&mdash;you don&rsquo;t even have a shower. You have to bathe in buckets and stuff. So it&#39;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s weird. It&#39;s freaky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was probably quite a difficult adjustment?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, yeah&hellip; For you to take a shower with hot water, you had to buy wood and burn it and stuff like that. So it was kind of weird, it was something so different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s very different. Could you tell me a little bit more about your dad? You said that he was deported, but then after you came here, he was away from your family?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He has another family, actually. He had two kids with another lady. So that&#39;s the main reason why everything happened. It was because of that. After we found out that he was having another life with somebody else, like from that point on, my childhood, my whole mentality, I guess, it changed everything. Like he took my childhood away when that happened. So I don&#39;t think ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, I blame it all on him. Everything that&#39;s happened to me. Everything that I&#39;ve gone through. Because of that, that&#39;s where I am today. I&#39;m here&hellip; I&rsquo;m here struggling to get a job. I&#39;m here struggling to feed my kid. So it&rsquo;s&hellip; I don&#39;t know. I mean, if I was there, to be honest, I think I would be a lot better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel a lot of anger towards him?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still in contact with him?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, we talk to each other and everything, but ever since that point or that day that we found out or that I actually confronted him about it, even though I was just a kid, that day that we found out that, I mean, our relationship wasn&#39;t the same, or isn&#39;t the same, since that day. So it&#39;s been a struggle with him, always. It&#39;s been like that even though we&#39;re here in Mexico and we&#39;re back together and all. Well, he&#39;s back with my mom and stuff, he still makes bad decisions that affects us all still. So it&#39;s like, he doesn&#39;t understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when you found out about this other family?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I was around maybe eight. Yeah. I would say eight years old. Seven maybe. I was still in elementary school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty young.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So yeah, I was pretty young. Yeah. Yes. From that point on, I mean, everything went down for me, everything crashed. So it was kind of harsh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you said that you confronted him about it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, actually ... Yeah, we, uhm&hellip; I mean, I didn&#39;t believe it at first. I saw things, but I mean, as a kid, you don&#39;t understand at what point things can happen until one day I actually saw him with this other family and this lady was coming to look for him and stuff and he started being bad to my mom. He started hitting her and started drinking. It was just not the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I actually confronted him about it. So what was going on and stuff like that and he actually ... One time that I found out she was around our house looking for him and stuff, I found out. So I went outside and started playing around and stuff and for my bad luck, she was actually outside the house that day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I confronted him about that, &quot;So what&#39;s going on? So is it true that you have another family? So what&#39;s going on?&quot; Basically. He got mad at me. He&#39;s the type of person or that type of parent, old school, that you can&#39;t say anything to your dad no matter what he did or what he does, you can&#39;t confront him or you can&#39;t, uhm, you can&rsquo;t tell him anything about what he did. So that was his anger at that time. He hit me and stuff. So he started getting angry at us for anything that we&#39;d do, or we asked him or we judged them about, he would get off on this. So that was kind of cruel too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you the one that had to tell your mom about the other family?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not exactly. I mean, she knew. I think at one point she knew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you didn&#39;t know yet?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not yet. She knew, but that type of mom that you don&#39;t want your kids to be mad with their father.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted to protect you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So yeah, that&#39;s a lot of stress on your shoulders as a young kid-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean, from that point on, to be honest, I mean, I swear to God, it all went down for me. From that point on. The store we had, we were living good. I mean, my uncle was the one that started the store industry, the Mexican stores over there. So my dad, uh, continued with him. They had two, three stores. I really don&#39;t remember, but we didn&#39;t have a bad life. We had a good quality of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when that happened, it was like ... it all went down for me. I was a straight-A student in the US. I still have my certificates. I was an honor student and everything. But from that point on, I think everything was just stressful. It was sad. It was just ... I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you told me in the survey that you started working at 13? So going to school and working at 13?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I get here when I&mdash;I left the states when I was in middle school, when I got here, so we didn&#39;t have any money. So I started working with my grandparents. So that was around maybe 12, 13 years old, I think. I really don&#39;t remember exactly, but I started working to give my mom money since my dad wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; he wasn&rsquo;t making... he wasn&#39;t taking charge of us, I guess? That&#39;s the way you say it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I had to start working because I wanted to, not because my mom told me to, I did it for myself and from that point on, so I started working, working, working. So I started making my own money too. So school really wasn&#39;t in my head that much anymore. So I just started working more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school here was a struggle too because that&#39;s when I started to work more and more and more. So I made it out of middle school as a miracle because I didn&#39;t have that good grades anymore because of the jobs, I started working a lot too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever have time to do homework or study?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never&hellip;No. I had to be at school at seven and I came out of school at three and I was at work from around 3:30 to four. From that point on until 9, 10, or maybe even 11 at night, we were still loading trucks and stuff. That&#39;s what I used to do. Load trucks of wood. Like, uh, I don&#39;t know how you say it in English. It&#39;s basically the wood they need for construction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lumber?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. That kind of thing. So that&#39;s what I was dedicated to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It kind of sounds like you had an adult life almost at that point?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Almost all the people that I know or that know who I am, they always, always said that about me. That as a kid, when I was in middle school, I didn&#39;t have that kind of thinking of, &quot;Let&#39;s go drink ...&quot; Well, the typical thing here, &quot;Let&#39;s go drinking. Let&#39;s go ...&quot; I don&#39;t know, just have fun. No, I was more about, &quot;I got to work. I got to pay this. I got to pay that. I got to get money here. I got to get money there.&quot; So around 14, 15 years old, I wasn&#39;t even thinking about having fun, to be honest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what led to you dropping out of school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a motorcycle crash. Uhm&hellip; It was uhm&hellip; I was&hellip; Well, the motorcycle crash. I was trying to get past a car and another car was coming this way. So at the same time, when I was trying to cross this car, he started speeding more so I couldn&#39;t beat him. So we crashed like in front of each other with the other truck that was coming towards my way. From that point on my, I told my dad, because I was having bad grades anyways. I told my dad, &quot;You know what? I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t want to study anymore.&quot; My dad was already with us at that time. So I told him, &quot;I don&#39;t want to study more. I just want to work.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you injured from the crash?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had uh&hellip; Not that bad, but I think my shorter was dislocated, if I&#39;m not mistaken, and a few hits on my head, but that&#39;s it, not much. But yeah. I mean, they didn&#39;t let me go to school or anything or work for a while, but I told my dad straight up that I didn&#39;t want to study anymore. I was more in working. So I was so used to getting money now. So I was like, &quot;I don&#39;t need school anymore.&quot; But now that I have my kid and I&#39;m like, &quot;I should have studied. I should have studied instead.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wish you had stayed in school longer?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. I wish I would. I&#39;m planning to, but I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of thing would you want to study?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m really into electronic things with the devices and stuff. The technology nowadays, that&#39;s what I&#39;m really into. But I don&#39;t know, I guess ... Not even when I was in school, I never had like a clear view of what I wanted to study or what I wanted to be. I never had that kind of mentality either because I was always thinking of the problems at home. So I&#39;ve never really thought about it either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you had stayed in the US, if your dad had never been deported or if you guys hadn&#39;t followed, when he got deported, how do you think your life would be different?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it would be a lot different. I mean, as I mentioned, I was a straight-A student. I was always on honor rolls. I was in advanced classes. I was good at math at that time too. I was advanced classes for mathematics and algebra. So I think I would have been great, to be honest, I would be a straight-A student and I would be still studying, to be honest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&#39;t that kind of kid that liked to socialize that much. I was more in my own thing kind of guy. Even here, I&#39;m the same kind of person. I like to do what I do. If I got a job, just do what I have to do and go back and go home with my family. That&#39;s my main thing. I&#39;ve always been that kind of person, I don&#39;t know why.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a kid in the US, did you think about what you wanted to be when you grew up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. As a kid, no. I mean, at that time I was still thinking about just studying and having fun. I mean, at that time, I really didn&#39;t think of anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now you&#39;ve mentioned maybe wanting to go back to school. You have a wife and a daughter. When you think about your life in Mexico now going forward, what are some of your hopes for your future?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hope is&hellip;One big hope is getting a house here. Try to buy a house if I can. To give my daughter a better life too. I mean, that would be my main goal. Give my daughter a better life and not do the things or do the mistakes that my dad did. That&#39;s one of my biggest, biggest, biggest things. Not doing what my dad did, leaving her alone or not giving her anything or just giving her a better life and giving her a better example and always hoping she sees me as a good father now. I mean, I would love to be able to take her to the states and meet all my family members, see what the life is there, but it is what it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that there&#39;s anything more that the US could do to help families like yours where one family member gets deported or left behind?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean exactly?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that the government should be doing anything to help the family members left behind? Or that there should be some kind of support there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess supporting them. I can&#39;t really say what else than supporting. I mean, I see life here and it&#39;s like the things they have there, even with the insurance they have for medication, for doctors. I mean, it&rsquo;s&mdash;the quality of the service there is good. It&#39;s great even though it&#39;s from the government. Here, you get that ... I mean, you can go to a hospital here, even though you&#39;re dying, they&#39;re not going to even take you into consideration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, to be honest, just this Friday, my brother-in-law got electrocuted by trying to put electricity for my neighbor&#39;s house. So he got electrocuted. It was pretty bad. He got to the hospital. So, I mean, thank God he got, uhm, he got attended well. He got a good bed and everything. So he got attended good. But it&#39;s a typical thing here that-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he okay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, thank God he is actually, he might be leaving the hospital today. So hopefully I&#39;ll get to see him later on today. But I mean, for me, it&#39;s normal now because I mean, you see it everywhere. But here in hospitals, you, you&hellip; That day like for example, Saturday, I saw a lady going there, notary lady going in there, almost crying, almost crawling on the floor because I don&#39;t know something was wrong with her leg or something. They just said, &quot;You know what? We don&#39;t have any room, go somewhere else.&quot; Just like that, I mean, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for me to say that they should help more in the US, I don&#39;t know. I really can&#39;t say like, &quot;Yeah, they need something else,&quot; because I don&#39;t know if the people there forget how life is here, they don&#39;t consider what they&#39;re getting. I mean, for the simple fact of medical attention. I mean, with that, I mean, that would be great here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I don&#39;t&hellip; I don&rsquo;t really know exactly like something, or benefits, I really don&#39;t have in mind. Maybe just economic benefits for people that actually do need it, really do need it from over there. Like for mothers that stay, like for example, my mom. I would have loved if somebody would have helped us economically, maybe from the government. We were without my dad. My mom, she didn&#39;t know any English. She doesn&#39;t know any English. So it was a struggle for her to give us food, give us a home to live, give us clothes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she have a job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she used to sell food, but to certain people&#39;s houses, but Mexican food, carnitas. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used to do those every weekend. She used to make them Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and she would sell them. She would send me actually to sell them to my friends&#39; house or other people&#39;s houses. I would go on bikes, we would just call them and see if they wanted an order of something. So I would just take it to them. Stuff like that. That&#39;s the way she was getting money into the house at that time. Also, with the help of my uncles and aunts too. So we got a little bit of help from family members. So it was okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what about here in Mexico? Is there anything that you wish had been done to help you and your family integrate back into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe at least giving us a place to actually live in. I mean, giving us&hellip; giving people that don&#39;t have anything here, giving them a place they can actually live in so they won&#39;t struggle with the rents. I mean, you&#39;re going to get here, you&#39;re not going to have a job. Your fam&mdash;even if you got family here, maybe your family&#39;s living well, but some others don&#39;t have that opportunity that their family&rsquo;s living good here, even though they&#39;re here in Mexico. Maybe that kind of thing because we struggled a lot with the home thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, we lived with my grandparents and all, but at the end of the day, we were kicked out. We were kicked out. So I would have really appreciated it if somebody would have given us maybe just some place to live. I don&#39;t know, just a shelter or something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why were you kicked out, if you don&#39;t mind?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, I really don&#39;t know why. I just&hellip; from one day to another my grandparents got mad with us and they just said, &quot;You know what? Move out. Move out and go to your other home.&quot; It was&hellip; it was our house. I mean, we paid for it and everything, but it wasn&#39;t in the conditions for living. So that was our main struggle. So we didn&#39;t have all the services. We didn&#39;t have water, we didn&#39;t have gas or not even electricity. We had to contract somebody from outside to put the electricity. So it was just because of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s always been a </span><span class="c2">hazard </span><span class="c1">with them, actually, my grandparents, too. So&hellip; I don&#39;t know, the main reason was them, to be honest, but it was just from one day to another. I&#39;ve never asked and never wanted to ask what was the reason why because I know I&#39;ll probably get mad with them and I just don&#39;t want any more problems with one of my family, I just want it to be the way it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Don&#39;t want to bring up old the stuff in the past?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It&#39;s not worth it. It&#39;s just not worth it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a lot of young boys, especially, or young men, returning from the US back to Mexico struggling to have enough money sometimes turn to gangs or crime. Did anything like that ever happened with you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe not when I was a kid because I didn&#39;t know much. I just wanted to work, work, work. But when I got married and now that I have a kid, I didn&#39;t finish my study. So now, present day, sometimes it does like give me that little thing in my head that tells me, &quot;You know what? Let&#39;s do this or let&#39;s do that.&quot; Or friends ... Well, we can&#39;t call them friends, but people tell me that, &quot;You know what? Let&#39;s do this. It&#39;s easy money. Let&#39;s do it. You don&#39;t have to do much. You just have to do this and this and let&#39;s go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think of my daughter and wife and say, &quot;No, I have to look for another way.&quot; I mean, there has to be another way. My English, it&#39;s what is bringing me, I guess, out of life again? I guess you can say it that way. It&#39;s given me a future, not having to do bad things, working in a good way. So I mean, I&#39;m glad for that too. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t forget my English because I never even kept on using it that much here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Your English is still perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. That&#39;s what people tell me too, even though I would ... Not even with my sister, I never used it when she was here until I got into the call center industry. That&#39;s when I started working on it again, again, again, again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So English has been helpful for you with jobs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot. A lot. A lot. It&#39;s been three years since I got in the call center business and those three years from now, it&#39;s where I&#39;ve gotten to a further&hellip; further place, I guess I can say it that way. I was able to pay my own rent. I was able to make my own things. I was able to, uh&mdash;my kid, now I have a daughter, I&#39;m able to give her something to eat and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I mean, even though with that, it still has ... I mean, if me or us people that know English can make good money and it&#39;s still not even enough, imagine what other people here, or that just have a simpler job, imagine what the life is for them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was in that position once, so I understand and I know what it feels like. But now, I mean, even though I am where I am today, it&#39;s still a struggle every day. There might be jobs, but they just&hellip; they don&#39;t take you into consideration still. That&#39;s the thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s also another situation here that even though you have a&mdash;you &nbsp;study, you studied at a university, you got through college, you got your paper and stuff, you got a good education, it doesn&#39;t matter. There&#39;s no jobs and the jobs there are, they don&#39;t even pay that well. So it&#39;s just either you do this or you do the bad things. So it&#39;s basically depending on each person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and the way you explained it, it&#39;s easy to see why it would be so easy to fall into that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s people in call centers here that have a good education. I mean, I don&#39;t know how you say it in English, but I mean, they have a good education. They can be lawyers or something bigger, but at the end of the day, they&#39;re there, they&#39;re in call centers. They could even be doctors and stuff, but they&#39;re here in call centers. Why? Because the jobs are not paying enough or there is no jobs. That&#39;s the thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was, I was talking to a kid the other day here. He&#39;s a janitor here in this place and he got a good education, but he&#39;s&hellip; he&rsquo;s a janitor. I mean, that&#39;s not bad, but I mean, he studied for something. So it&#39;s kind of bad. The situation is bad here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that&#39;s why so many people want to go to the US to try to get a better job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, I mean, on my point of view, if I would go, that would be my main thing. Work, work, work, work until I make good money and come back and be with my family. If I could take my family with me and stay there, I would. But I mean, I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has your wife ever been to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No. They have no idea what it&#39;s like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your daughter, obviously, hasn&#39;t been?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. No, I wish I could take her and give her all the things that I had when I was a kid still. That&#39;s what I wish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I can tell the way you talk about it, that your daughter is your main priority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s the main thing of my life. So everything I can, I do it for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have one last question as we start wrapping up, because I&#39;m thinking about how you have spent almost half and half, like half your life in the US half in Mexico. Do you feel like you&#39;re more Mexican or more American or both? Neither?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say both because I mean, I can understand people over there and I can understand people here, I guess that would be the main reason. So I know what it&#39;s like being over there. I know how life is and thanks to that, of me being in the US, now, here, I know how to take care of things or how can you say it? I know what things are worth now because things over there were just given to me. Here, I have to earn them, or I have to work really hard to get them, really hard. So it&rsquo;s&hellip; I think the US really helped me a lot in seeing things now that I&#39;m grown in a different way. That&#39;s what I want to show my daughter to know what it&#39;s worth, the good things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To appreciate what you have?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. Appreciate what you have and appreciate what you&#39;re doing, I guess. You might be at the top one day and the next day you might be at the bottom. It&#39;s the way life is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s true. Yeah. Like in your own life, things changed so drastically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, dramatically. Yeah. Yeah, it was crazy to be honest. It&#39;s crazy. Things here, for example, clothing here. Here if you want to buy clothing, you have to spend a lot of money on it. You can spend what you worked ... maybe 15 days of work are worth maybe one pants here. That&#39;s the way it is. I mean, it&#39;s hard. It&#39;s hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It&#39;s really hard. It&rsquo;s&hellip; to have a kid here, even now, sometimes you don&#39;t have clothes to give her, or when she was little, the diapers and all. When my daughter was born, I was still working as a lumberjack. So I used to win around 1200 pesos a week. So diapers itself were like around almost 300 pesos. Then my rent and the bus. So basically I couldn&#39;t do anything. I didn&#39;t do anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was&mdash;I know what it is. I know what it is. Now that I got into this whole industry of English here in Mexico, I really do appreciate it all. Maybe that would be another thing. Maybe that American companies could do more things here in Mexico so us people that know English can get into it a little bit more and make more money, stuff like that, maybe more jobs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More job opportunities for English speakers, English educated people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, exactly. I mean, that would really help us a lot. A lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to end on a positive note, what is your favorite thing about living in Mexico or a favorite experience? Best experience? Favorite aspect of living here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel free that&#39;s for one. I feel free. I don&#39;t feel ... I mean, as I mentioned, you struggle every day thinking about what&#39;s going to happen, if you&#39;re going to get home or not. But I mean, you&#39;re not discriminated because I&#39;ve never been discriminated here. In the US, I remember other people saying things about us or saying things about me and stuff. So that&#39;s one thing that I really do like about here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People don&#39;t judge you that much, I guess, no matter who you are, or what you do or what you say, what you wear, they don&#39;t judge you that much here. You&#39;re free. You&#39;re free to think your own thing. That&#39;s something cool here. I guess that would be one really good thing about Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free to be yourself a little bit more?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, that would, that would be it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s great. Anything else that you want to add that we haven&#39;t talked about? Anything you wish I had asked?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Joel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not much. That&#39;s pretty much all my life. It&#39;s just a struggle, but we&#39;ve got to do&hellip; we&rsquo;ve to live life. There&#39;s no other way.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
