So this is Claudia, and I&#39;m interviewing </span><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">, whose ID number is Lilimora 323. So first of all I want to say thank you for coming here and speaking with us. I understand that talking about this experience can sometimes be a little hard, especially because you&#39;re reliving and retelling stories and emotions that you might not necessarily want to, but I think it&#39;s good to know how important your story is. And how important it is for people to hear it so that they can understand the human side of migration and the realities.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that&#39;s correct. No problem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I guess my first question is why did you leave Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you leave Mexico to go to the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. Because my parents separated when I was 10 years old. So we ended up living with my dad. He&#39;s the one that took us to Los Angeles actually. And from that time, when I was 10, I&#39;m 32 years old, we never came back. We live over there. We went to school, and we did our life over there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m going to put this a little bit further out so that I can pick you up better. So do you remember your first day in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. We got there to Los Angeles and it was late, and I remember my aunt because she was already there. She gave us some food and put us in a room, me and my two sisters we went to sleep. And wake up next day to a new life. And it was okay, I guess. But I didn&#39;t like school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&rsquo;t?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because I didn&#39;t speak English, and everybody did. And it was kind of hard the first six months. I didn&#39;t want to go to school at all. But then I guess I did get used to it and learn. Because they give you the ESL classes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ESL?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So that was good and it helped out a lot. And that was it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember any teachers or friends that you had that really helped you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I just remember the ESL teacher was really patient with me, especially. Because I would cry out of frustration. I guess I put more effort because I started watching TV in English every afternoon. And I learned. I know I have an accent, but that&#39;s just me. But I know English. I did speak English.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so how was your life in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was good and bad. You know like everything. But I always thought... like I went to, I finished high school over there. I did the normal things like everybody does. Goes to the mall. Watch a movie. Everything, like normal stuff. I had my friends. A boyfriend, and break up. And then I started working. I bought a car. I change another car. But I never had a license. So that was my first when I notice, </span><span>&ldquo;O</span><span class="c3">h, I am different.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Me and my two sisters. My two sisters are younger than me. So they were like eight and five when they got there, so they speak English better, and they were thinking they&#39;re from over... They didn&#39;t have no clue that it was going to be a problem later on. But since I was the older one, I mean I knew, I knew because my dad. I knew. But my dad said, &quot;It&#39;s okay. Just get a car and somebody else will get it under their name or whatever, and I will make the payments.&quot; And I did. I changed cars a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I had good jobs I think. I started working in places where I used to cook in the kitchen for three years, and then I changed to work in a check cashing place where I worked for seven years, and cashed checks, send money to anywhere like Mexico. But I never sent money myself to Mexico, because I never thought I was going to be back. And in reality, my family, my uncles, my tia. My kids I have to give over there too. Everybody. So, I was living like a normal life. My dad bought a house. I help him to buy a house in Los Angeles. My dad, he has a business even. But no papers either. He doesn&#39;t have papers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the business?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s sewing machines. He&rsquo;s a mechanic, so he has a lot of sewing machines. And he sells them, or repair the sewing machines. He is really good at it. And I love my dad. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your favorite job in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The check cashing place. Because I liked to do that. Cashing checks, giving money orders. We sell a lot of the lotto tickets, the scratchers. I liked that job a lot. You know? It gives me a lot of satisfaction when I used to cash checks for people that didn&#39;t have no IDs, and we make them the IDs and they would cash it every week. You get to know a lot of people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so your two kids. Are they American citizens?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yes they are. But they&#39;re over there. When I got deported, my dad told me I was not going to take the kids, because why would I do that when I&#39;m going to struggle over here? And I am struggling a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old are they?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are right now, they are 10 and eight.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me how you ended up back in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess when I was younger, my 20s or whatever, like I said, I always drive car. I drive a car. And I crash a time. But I never had a license or... They took me to jail because I crash and I didn&#39;t have a license, so that was one thing. But that was a like couple of years ago. And I never went back to court or anything, because I thought, well, why would I go back if I don&#39;t have a license? By that time, they were not pushing on the deportation. They were not doing deportations or anything, so I went to jail and got out in a week. And I thought, this is fine. I just ran across. And I did. But we never change address or nothing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they had my information so I got stopped by the cops again for no license and got my cars taken away</span><span>&nbsp;in the </span><span class="c3">impound. </span><span>I never went again. </span><span class="c1">A couple times. So why wasn&#39;t I registered? They had my information, I guess, and when it was everything like Trump and all that, when they were doing deportations, they started going through the list of people that owns any kind of things like that. And I was one of them. And immigration went and picked me up at my house. And I was there, and I gave myself up because there&#39;s most people living there. They didn&#39;t have no papers. So they said, &quot;If you don&#39;t give yourself up, we&#39;re going to go in and take everybody that has no papers.&quot; And why would I affect everybody? So I did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it your family that lived in that house?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family, and besides them, my dad rents... He has the garage, like and then he has another little house out in the back. My dad</span><span>&nbsp;has</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;with his house. He rents those places to people. He help people have &ldquo;no fucking&rdquo; job. I&#39;m sorry. People has no papers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they were going to search and the thing with the garage is not legally converted. You know? It has to be for cars, and my dad rent that place for people. So it was going to be all bad. So I just given myself up. And I fought my case for a year and a half in detention.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was detention?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detention wasn&#39;t bad. It wasn&#39;t bad at all. They provided me a lot of things. My dad pay a lawyer to fight the case. But we went to court three times out of this year and a half. We went three times to court, and the judge always deny me my bond, because my dad was </span><span>post bond</span><span class="c1">. Even my dad wanted to put his house. [Emotional] And the judge didn&#39;t want. He said I was in trouble because I crash. At that time I crash with my car and I left. But I left because I didn&#39;t have a license. I didn&#39;t hurt nobody. I crashed to a tree. You know? So therefore, we fought the case for a year and a half. And when I saw that nothing was happening, I just signed to go to Mexico. That&#39;s it. [Emotional] And I&#39;ve been here for a year and a half. I don&#39;t like it&hellip; I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s okay. Well, if you&#39;re comfortable, can you tell me a little bit about what the past year has been like in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s been sucks. Because, a lot of people that live here, they have their life. They always been here. I know in Mexico there&#39;s a</span><span>n amount </span><span class="c3">who you know and who you grow up with, and some of these are yours. Even</span><span class="c4 c3">&nbsp;despuestos</span><span class="c1">, you know. I know a lot of people because I&#39;m a social person. I don&#39;t really have a social person. I&#39;m always happy or try to see the best thing out of things. [Emotional] But once you start speaking English, they don&#39;t like you. Or they treat you different. They don&#39;t help you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here to live somewhere, I stay in the hotels. I stay in a hotel every day. Every day. I want to rent an apartment. Maybe I don&#39;t have the whole money or whatever, but they want the first deposit, the second rent, and I don&#39;t know how they call it, but someone else to sign for you. Who&#39;s going to do that here? They don&#39;t know you. Who&#39;s going to give you a name or whatever, to say that you&#39;re good to pay? Nobody. Because they don&#39;t know you. They don&#39;t mess. You&#39;re not part of their circle. And a lot of people here is like that. Especially here in the city, like they don&#39;t... I sometimes have been short with money, a couple of pesos or whatever, and they&#39;re like, &quot;No like we cannot like we can do nothing about it. Go away.&quot; Or things like that. You know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a couple pesos&hellip; &nbsp;To me, even when you go to a place, and or you go with people, that say like in TeleTech and there&rsquo;s a lot of people they look like &ldquo;Oh, they&#39;re homeless.&quot; Right? And they work </span><span>in Teletech</span><span class="c3">. And call centers. And you go to a place, and they look at you different. You order food, and you&#39;re the last one to get your food. And they&#39;re always doing things like that to people here. I think </span><span>t</span><span class="c1">here&#39;s a lot of discrimination here for us. A lot. They don&#39;t like us. And I feel like it&#39;s because they hate me or sometimes because they think that we had the opportunity to do something else, and we didn&#39;t. And now we&#39;re here taking the jobs, or taking their whatever. But yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there&#39;s a lot of discrimination. And the worst thing is that I know that we&#39;re not better, but our mentality is different because we live over there. And we can&#39;t do so many things. Bad depression. A lot of people has depression when they don&#39;t even know they do have depression. Because you leave everything there. And then people treats you like shit. But that&#39;s my experience. You know? My experience has been bad, really bad. And people here</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">me robaron el tel&eacute;fono</span><span class="c1">. They never know my phone got stolen with me. I&#39;ve been with my luggage everywhere. I try to keep my job but it&#39;s hard to stay a stable place. I&#39;ve been late to work and I get fired for two times I&#39;ve been late because I need to pay my room first.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I try not to call my dad for nothing for money. My dad sends me money, here and there. That&#39;s $50. $100 sometimes. Pero, I try not to ask him, and when he calls me, like when I call him and, &quot;I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m okay.&quot; But I know I&#39;m not okay. Because he has my two kids. Why would I ask him for more? And as long as they&#39;re with him, I&#39;m good. And that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there&#39;s no shelters. I want people will have a shelter. </span><span>It&rsquo;s like right </span><span class="c3">here. Maybe a shelter for woman and some shelter for men. To help you for I don&rsquo;t know a month, maybe. Where you can work and have a place to get a locker maybe. And you can save that money. And then get a place, because that&#39;s what&rsquo;s been my problem. I don&#39;t have a place to stay. And I know I can get a job. I know I can get a job, but I lost all my papers. They were with my luggage. My </span><span class="c4 c3">Act de Nacimiento</span><span class="c3">, my </span><span class="c4">CURP</span><span>, </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span>all that we need right here. </span><span class="c3">And I lose it because I leave my luggage in an internet caf&eacute;, or in the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">puestos de carnitas</span><span class="c1">. You know? Can I please leave my things here? Things like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c3">Pero</span><span class="c1">, I think it&#39;s necessary, a place where there&#39;s a shelter for immigrants like us. Like for woman, that has a couple lockers where we can leave our things for a month. I just need a month and somewhere to stay, and I don&#39;t have to pay rent on nothing, and then I think I can make it like that. It&#39;s been hard. Every day I have to pay my room. Right now I haven&#39;t paid my room. 200 is going to be for my room. 180 they charge. Now it&#39;s raining every day and it sucks. Like my clothes looking. I&#39;m wearing this because I don&#39;t have my clothes. And now sometimes I look ridiculous, but I just have to keep pushing. And do my thing. But it&#39;s hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has it been to be separated from your family?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad. Really bad. Like I said, there&#39;s a lot of depression even. I&#39;m not a depressed person. I&#39;m not. Every day I see something good, and I think, okay, it&#39;s a new day. It&#39;s going to be good. And I do generate money. However, I&#39;m a really active person. But it&#39;s bad, and I would think every peso. You have to earn it. Here you have to earn every peso. Every peso. And every peso is like, I have 20 pesos and I eat. And you have to drink something and you have to pay the room too, where you stay. And it&#39;s difficult. It&#39;s difficult, but I know it&#39;s going to be good. I guess.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you steal, and in the states even if you don&#39;t have no money, because you grow up over there, so you have a community that knows you, your family, your dad. My dad was always stay there, and he knows people, and I know people. And he has a house </span><span>in the States</span><span class="c1">. All our life we live there. We invest money on the house. Neighbors know us. You know? Our neighbors are Chinese. Family that we know. Next door is the Guadalajara people from Guadalajara. You know that they know us. Anything, any problem, I will have, I will run to them and they will help out because they know with them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And right here&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s not like that. That&#39;s bad. We need to have a community of immigrants or something that will help each other out or something, because they don&#39;t have&hellip; A lot of people, they make new families here. I&#39;ve seen people I know a lot of people from TeleTech, the call centers. It&#39;s different because they do say, &quot;Hi,&quot; whatever. They speak English. Or any person that speak English, I get attached to, because I feel at home. But sometimes that&#39;s bad too, because not everybody has the same intentions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So you work at TeleTech?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to work there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You used to. Are you working somewhere?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m not working nowhere. I don&#39;t have my papers either. And it&#39;s been two weeks because I got fired because I was late two days. But I was try to tell them I don&#39;t have a place to stay. Like I have to secure my room first. And they&#39;d say, &quot;When you have a place where to stay and you&#39;re more, you know? Then come back and we can give you a job.&quot; So I know I can get a job. But now I don&#39;t have my papers, and he&#39;s just like, &quot;Eh.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how to get them, or are you-</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I know. I know how. I know how. I just going to have to go to the </span><span>- I know </span><span class="c3">places already in Buena Vista. </span><span>Y</span><span class="c3">ou just go there. And they will get it for you in two weeks. In two weeks you will get you</span><span>r INM. </span><span class="c3">And th</span><span>e </span><span class="c4">Acto de Nacimiento</span><span>, </span><span class="c3">I </span><span>know I</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;have to go to the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">quiosco</span><span class="c1">, but I have to pay 28 pesos, which I don&#39;t have 28 pesos. And the court, you can get it on the internet. Things like that I can get. And the job is... I like working out there. Call centers. I&#39;m good on the phone. On the phone I&#39;m really good. Customer service. I like customer service.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you like it so much?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I like to help people. And the customer service. Once I&#39;m on the phone, I&#39;m good. I have another call center two stations away. I ride over to one. Then I was there for six months when I just got here. And they liked me a lot. </span><span class="c4 c3">Pero</span><span class="c1">, and I don&#39;t want to go there when I&#39;m looking like this, and all stressed out. And I&#39;m all skinny and everything. Because I don&#39;t have a place. And even if I had place, like I said for a month, then I&#39;ll be good. Fine.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know where you&#39;re staying tonight?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hotel, because I&#39;m going to go pay 180 right now. And that&#39;s where I&#39;m going to stay for-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s what you&#39;ve been doing every day for a year?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). For like six months.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). The other six months I work in another call center, and I was good there. But I had a boyfriend where I was staying with. And I had this boyfriend, I&#39;m telling you, I had this boyfriend that I met at TeleTech. Because he knows English and speak English, and I thought, okay, he&#39;s good. And I got attached to people. I&#39;m telling you, I got attached to people real quick and I think they&#39;re from over there. Are you from Los Angeles too? Oh yeah. Bu</span><span>t it was bad. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was staying with him and he used to hit me. Domestic Violence. And all these bad things. So I just got away from him too. That&#39;s why I&#39;m on the street, because he was like, &quot;Woman, leave the house.&quot; And so a lot of things and I didn&#39;t go. I didn&#39;t go because I </span><span>didn&rsquo;t have</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;a place to stay, but he start hitting me more. Didn&#39;t let me talk to my kids. So I say what am I doing with him. When he&#39;s treating me like that. I was over there. I&#39;ve been through a lot of things. And I&#39;m not going to let this go. Treat me like shit. </span><span class="c4 c3">Pero</span><span class="c3">, I have to leave. He said, &quot;Well, then. Leave my house.&quot; And I left. And it&#39;s been hard, as you can tell. Because I think I was going to stay with him because I don&#39;t have a place to stay. </span><span class="c4 c3">Pero</span><span class="c1">, it&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever denounce him to the police?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, because it was the same thing. I don&#39;t believe in the police here, because they&#39;re all not good. They don&#39;t do shit. He came out of jail for a couple of hours, then be out. And do it again. And just pay them. Here the police is no good for nothing. They have seen him here. Where they have seen us fight not once, and they didn&#39;t do nothing. They told me, &nbsp;&ldquo;He didn&#39;t hit you.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Look what he&#39;s done to me. He&#39;s going to kill me&quot; and things like that. And they&#39;re like, &quot;Just go away. Don&#39;t tell him nothing. Just go away so he can go away. Just go away.&quot; That&#39;s not good enough. It&#39;s stupid. They don&#39;t do nothing here for nobody. Until they see you learning and happy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I just decided to stay away from him. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. But it was hard. Sometimes I want to go back, just for him to let me stay. And I walk past. Sometimes you get attached to people just because you feel like, oh you know. They&#39;re from the same place you are. And it&#39;s not... I learned the hard way that... Not because I speak English or whatever they come from, they&#39;re good people. They&#39;re not. They try to take advantage of you too. Because they&#39;re going through the same thing, without them knowing. I even understand, because I feel like he&#39;s going through the same shit, and because he misses his family, and he goes through depression, but he doesn&#39;t know. </span><span class="c4">Se desquita conmigo</span><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c4 c3">Pero</span><span class="c1">, why would I suffer no more? Six months, and he wasn&#39;t good enough for me to notice. And he will make me feel like I&#39;m not worth it if I don&#39;t live in there. But I know I&#39;m worth it. But that&#39;s why it&#39;s been hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have you applied to have any help from any government or non-government organization?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. This is help. But other than that, no. This is the help. That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I think No Comienzo</span><span class="c4 c3">s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;can totally try to get you into a shelter if you need it. And they can-</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I already asked them. No. It&#39;s very low. I already asked them, but they don&#39;t have shelters. They help men, but they say in between them, &quot;Oh, who can have her in the house for two days?&quot; That&#39;s not a shelter. I even talked to Israel. But he needed to make a shelter. This is not a shelter. You&#39;re asking somebody else that works with you to let me stay in the house. And that&#39;s not good either, because they won&#39;t feel... Well, maybe they say yes, but it&#39;s not like they want to. Or maybe they don&#39;t have the space, or something like that. But in reality, I talked to him and I saw, you need to make a shelter like invest in a bodega, or something like over, there&#39;s a Salvation Army. The Salvation Army, that&#39;s how they have a bodega, converted like this, and they just divided girls, guys. I know, because I used to work for Salvation Army. I volunteer myself for Salvation Army.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the States. Yeah. So my dad used to go there too and volunteer time for giving for poor people at the Salvation Army. We did a lot of things over there in the community. Because we were there for the community. That&#39;s why I feel like it sucks. It&#39;s like, &quot;Wow. Here&#39;s there&#39;s nothing like that.&quot; My dad and myself, we used to do a lot of things. My dad was in Neighborhood Watch</span><span>, and all that</span><span class="c1">. And Salvation Army and my dad was in give time in the church, and give time to serve people that don&#39;t have no house. And look where I&#39;m at now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have you been able to maintain contact with your dad and your sons?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. When I had a phone, I do like calls on the weekends with my kids. Like on the weekends, I call and video chat or wait on the phone. And right now I&#39;m going to the internet and sometimes I message my kids. But I don&#39;t have a phone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how they&#39;re doing? Do you-</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I know my kid, older kid, he goes through depression himself. Because sometimes he&#39;s not doing good at school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think it has something to do-</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah. And sometimes I don&#39;t know if talking to him is bad, or [Emotional] not because some days when I talk to him, I think that why he drops his grades. Because he misses me. And when I don&#39;t speak to him for 2, 3 weeks, he does better. And that&#39;s sad, because I guess he gets stressed out with me being away. [Emotional] Why does he think like that? Like we&#39;re still going around like </span><span>they doing</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;nothing and nobody knows or cares&hellip;. Sometimes I&#39;ve been in the </span><span>Son Carlos. </span><span class="c1">You know how there&#39;s a lot of people there? But everybody&#39;s doing their thing, or living their life, and I feel so lonely sometimes between so many people, because you&#39;re just there by yourself. And it&#39;s crazy. How can you be around so much people in one city, and feel so lonely?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t have any family here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. My mom even is there. But she&#39;s not with my dad, but she&#39;s been there for a couple of years with her new husband or whatever. My t</span><span>&iacute;</span><span class="c3">as live in Chicago. They live in Chicago. I have more family in Utah. And my grandparents, they&#39;re in </span><span>Michoac&aacute;n</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;here. They&#39;re in</span><span>&nbsp;Michoac&aacute;n</span><span class="c3">. But</span><span>&nbsp;you know</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;they&#39;re old. And I mean you can just go ahead and be with them a couple of days because there&#39;s nothing else to do. And that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the Little LA community? Have you not even been able to find people there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I haven&#39;t really given time or because I&#39;m too worried about what I&#39;m need to go, or going through, or having my place. But I know if I come here and... I can be... I cannot say. I know I need some help. I guess I sometimes</span><span>&hellip; </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Because me, I couldn&#39;t even be around people, normal people. And do normal things, because I know a lot of people... I can&#39;t have fake, &quot;Oh yeah. Let&#39;s go shopping.&quot; Or &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; No. I don&#39;t care about that. And &quot;Let&#39;s go to Starbucks.&quot; I don&#39;t care about that. I care about getting my room. I care about going to get my stuff so I could change and shower. And I care about getting a phone so I can call my kids.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#39;m not a good company</span><span>,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I guess so</span><span>.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I when I&#39;m worrying or something else. But this, what you guys doing and then giving us money for it, is good. Because it is a lot of help. And it makes people think and hear different stories. You know? And there&#39;s a lot of people that have made it here, I know. And I know people that has been here for 10 years. And they&#39;re good now. They&#39;re good, and that&#39;s my goal. I say, &quot;Okay, maybe there is a first year, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m going through this.&quot; But it will pass. And in 10 years, my kids are going to be older, and they&#39;re going to be here basically. And I&#39;m going to have a place where I&#39;m going to take them everywhere. And we&#39;re going to be okay. And that&#39;s my hope and my goal. And I know that&#39;s what gets me... </span><span class="c3 c4">esperanza</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;every day, because I know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at these people, and I know, well, he&#39;s been here three years. And he has a family. And he&#39;s happy, and he has a car, and he has a house. And he goes on vacations to Acapulco. I can do that. I can make it. When my kids come, we can be like, &quot;Okay. Let&#39;s go to Canc</span><span>&uacute;</span><span class="c1">n.&quot; You got to be older, and my older kid tells me, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m going to grow up. I&#39;m grown up and I will go see you.&quot; And I will bring you back. I&#39;m going to go over there, and we&#39;re going to have fun. So he knows that too, and I just have to be patient, and put work on it, like keep pushing him like you&#39;re pushing.. I do that. I will because I&#39;ve got to be doing a lot of stupid things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the streets, a lot of people will ask me, &quot;How much you want?&quot; Or &quot;How much you need?&quot; </span><span class="c4">Pero</span><span>,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you have to do this or that. And I don&#39;t do it, because I know I&#39;m better than that. And it takes me a little longer, but it&#39;s good. At the end, it&#39;s good. It&#39;s going to be good. I know. Yeah. I know it&#39;s going to be okay there. Like I say, I see people here in TeleTech 10 years, and they&#39;re good. And I see them, and I say, &quot;Okay.&quot; And like I say, I just need a place for a month.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m working on things like that, because there&#39;s a lady I met, and she&#39;s old. But I help her, because she was going to fall. She was by my </span><span>side</span><span class="c3">, and she almost fell. And I helped her to get up, and I take her to wherever she was going. And then she asked me, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, you know. Here and there.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;Give me your number. I&#39;ll give you mine.&quot; And I live in </span><span>Tlaltelolco</span><span class="c3">. I have a suite there. She&#39;s old. She&#39;s like, &quot;And I have a business, pero. &nbsp;If you want, I can rent you a room.&quot; And I say, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c4">S&iacute;</span><span>?&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;And I say, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And I&#39;m &quot;But how much do you need?&quot; And she like, &quot;You stop. You just call me and we talk about it.&quot; Maybe the lady doesn&#39;t even need money. It look like it was a wealthy. And because the action I did, she might let me stay there and pay her 1000 and then another 1000 and things like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you called her?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will. I will. That was just a couple days ago. But I will. And things like that, when I do good things, I know good things happen. And that will be a lot of help because for a couple of days or whatever, I can go get a job and then from there start generating a</span><span>&nbsp;stay there</span><span class="c1">. That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither here, nor from there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Exactly. Exactly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you tell me a little bit more about that, if you want to?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean it&#39;s just like I said, you know, from here or from over there. Because you don&#39;t belong here. They make you feel that since day one. I&#39;m here. And they make sure you understand that you&#39;re not a Mexican. And they call us &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c3">pochos</span><span class="c3">&rdquo; They call everybody&hellip; and. Or your people. They have told me, &quot;Hey. Is that you and your people?&quot; Or, &quot;Another one of your people came over here the other day and did this or that or whatever.&rdquo; &nbsp;And I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t even know who you&#39;re talking about.&quot; They&#39;re like, &quot;Well, yeah. One of the </span><span class="c4 c3">pochos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;people.&quot; So we&#39;re not Mexicans. We&#39;re not them. And Americans, we&#39;re not obviously, because we got deported. They didn&#39;t consider us Americans, even if we would live all our lives there and pay taxes. So I don&#39;t know what we are.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&#39;s not bad. I mean. You know? We&#39;re unique. Nothing bad with that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you could have stayed in the United States, what do you think you might have done?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. If I would have stayed in the United States, I want be first of all with my kids. I will invest more in my dad&#39;s house because my dad, I was always with him. We invested in a lot of things together, me and my dad. I always follow what he says. And I was good. Maybe I would have a business with him, that we were planning on doing together. But we didn&#39;t because he had to pay a lawyer. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you&#39;ve been here in Mexico, I know you already kind of talked about this a little bit, but what do you think that you&#39;d like to do? What are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreams are to have a place. I want to have an apartment, a nice apartment here in downtown. I just need to focus, because we have a lot of advantages. First of all, the language. Second of all, our mentality is different. We are not regular Mexicans. We have the American in us. And like I said, maybe we just&hellip; I just need to&hellip; little by little. And once I&#39;m there, I&#39;ll take over.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would like to have an apartment, a nice apartment in downtown. A business going. Let everybody know what I want to do. I want a business and that&#39;s it. Having my kids coming over, maybe I want them to be older a little. They will come over, and we will go on a lot of places. I show them Mexico. I will show them how Mexico is.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What business would you like to have?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to have a </span><span class="c4 c3">ranchera</span><span class="c3">. There&#39;s no </span><span class="c4 c3">rancheras</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;here. Over there, you know the truck, the food trucks? Things like that with real burritos. Real wet burritos. There&#39;s no burritos here. They serve you burritos with lettuce inside. They have lettuce and they don&#39;t have no rice. I&#39;m like, &quot;Have you ever been in King Taco?&quot; Or places like that where you have a burrito is a burrito with rice, beans, carne asada, sour cream, and salsa. That&#39;s a burrito. And they don&#39;t make it here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hamburgers they put ham in the hamburger. I&#39;m like, &quot;No ham please.&quot; That&#39;s not a hamburger. So I always talk shit</span><span>&nbsp;in the </span><span class="c4">puesta</span><span class="c3">. I&#39;m like, &quot;Nah. That&#39;s not a hamburger. Please take this out. This is out. Put this in. You don&#39;t have no pickles? You know what a pickle is?&quot; You know? Things like that. I&#39;m real sarcastic sometimes with people, and maybe they don&#39;t like. But it&#39;s true. They don&#39;t have American food. And Chinese food. I love Chinese food. And there&#39;s a couple of Chinese places that are good right here. And that&#39;s good. Because it used to be too expensive here to go to a Chinese place. No, too much for me. This was too much. But now I see them in the metro</span><span>.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;There&#39;s a little Chinese person. She doesn&#39;t even speak English. She speaks Hispaniola. And I&#39;m used to seems Chinese people, but they speak English. Or they speak a lot of Spanish and whatever the language is Chinese. I guess. But there&#39;s Chinese food that is good. And it&#39;s cheap now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there&#39;s no real Mexican and American food. And that will be nacho. You know the nacho? They don&#39;t have no nacho here. I want some carne asada nachos or chili cheese fries. I want the chili cheese fries. And then I will have a truck that will go from call center to call center. So every time they come out on their break, I&#39;ll be there serving them. And then move to another call center that I know. On their break, they come out. They want to eat fast because you have to go back and you have 30 minutes for break, lunch. That&#39;s what they give you. 30 minutes an hour most. I work in call center so I know. And being on the phone the whole day is not good either. I don&#39;t like call centers either, nine hours on the phone. 30 minutes of break. It&#39;s not good enough and they pay you little.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I want a food truck, and they have a lot of trucks. And I will, because my burritos, nachos and chili cheese fries, carne asada fries. Carne asada. A real carne asada. That&#39;s it. Teriyaki rolls. Not burritos or taco. No. And that&#39;s food for us. For American</span><span>-Mexicans that we&#39;re here. Call centers. That&#39;s all they have. And they will know us, as soon as they know, &quot;Ah. There&#39;s a truck. [vocal beep beep sound] Oh, there&#39;s a truck. That&#39;s Lily&#39;s truck. Cool.&quot; And nacho. You don&#39;t like carne asada burrito. And some nachos. Carne asada nachos, all right? Cool. Extra meat. Ooh. Salsa. Sour cream. That&#39;s it. Perfect.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds awesome.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. I even got hungry. [Laughs] And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s my dream.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, when you do it, I&#39;m going to come back. I promise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, when you come to Mexico, yes. And you come to Mexico, you find my page on the internet. I will have my truck then. And you&#39;ll see how, I know. I like business. I&#39;m a business person. I&#39;m too depressed. But I know I&#39;m going to do it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think that what you said is very true. This is the second year that we do this study, and I think there&#39;s definitely a correlation between the amount of time that you spend in Mexico and how better your life gets. And if you weren&#39;t even here a year or two, maybe there was somebody who&#39;s only been here for 45 days. And obviously he&#39;s not doing very well. And like people are struggling, but then once you get out, it gets better.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to get better. Because people are, like you said. And I seen it. 10 years and up or whatever people been here. I&#39;m like, &quot;How long you been here?&quot; And &quot;Ah. 10 years.&quot; &quot;Wow.&quot; But they have a motorcycle, they have a house, they have a car, and they have a new family. A lot of them have new families here. And I&#39;m not trying to have new family or new kids, I don&#39;t want to have kids, no. I want to keep the ones I have happy and you know have something for them when they come. That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re very proud of you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they will be. And now they will be. That&#39;s it. Thank you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the last set of questions are more like reflective. But what can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know, because everybody that comes back is older. They&#39;re grown ups. I don&#39;t know. I really don&#39;t know how to answer that question. That will be just help with, I don&#39;t know. Assistance. Like food stamps or things like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kind of similarly, what can the US government do to help Mexican deportees and the families that they leave behind in the states?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, don&#39;t deport them. Don&rsquo;t deport. Or give us some kind of </span><span class="c4 c3">permisos</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to go maybe and stay for a month or higher, depending on how you doing over here or how bad was your crime over there? Maybe instead of 10 years, it should be okay 10 years but in two years or whatever you will have a hearing in Mexico from somebody over there and maybe see how you&#39;re doing over here and who you want to go see over there, which is the kids or whatever. And maybe have a week with them, with their permission. Then come back. I don&#39;t know. Something like that. That would be nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why do you think that people in Mexico have a negative perception of returning migrants?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because first of all, they hating. My point of view is like they hate. Because a lot of them wanted to go over there, and they couldn&#39;t. And because we did, and we&#39;re back, everybody thinks that we&#39;re back because we did something bad over there. Most of the time. That&#39;s why you get deported. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Pero</span><span>, </span><span class="c1">I mean, so they see us as everybody is bad, and they&#39;re coming over here and doing more bad stuff. I guess. But a lot of times, people do hate that they&#39;re not there. And we did. And we speak English and they don&#39;t. And they think we&#39;re talking about them, but we&#39;re not even talking about them. They see us as disrespectful when we speaking English in a group, but I say them, &quot;That&#39;s our first language.&quot; That&#39;s why we feel comfortable with... And why we&#39;re stopping, we&#39;re not talking to you, lady. Why are you listening to them? They&#39;re just nosy. Nosy, they like to know everything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those were like the questions that I had. But now I want to give you a chance to say whatever you want to say. If you want to add stuff. If you think there&#39;s something that people should know. Anything at all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that&#39;s it I think. There&#39;s a lot of depression when you come from the </span><span>S</span><span class="c1">tates and then... But there&#39;s a lot of opportunities if you take them. But you have to be really strong and don&#39;t care about nobody else, or what people think. I think there should be more like kind of psychology help when you come back because some of us, we don&#39;t know when we are depressed. And a lot of people goes into drugs because of that depression. Here, it&#39;s not helping either. And a lot of people just... I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have some kind of group or something that is really strong and help and understand your point of view when you come here. Because everybody&#39;s like, &quot;Well, just get a job. Just get a job. It&#39;s not bad.&quot; It&#39;s not only that. It&#39;s that people you&#39;re around. You&#39;re trying to make new friends and to have a family or to have some strong bonds with someone and a lot of times you can&#39;t find it, because the people next to you is broken too. But they don&#39;t know it. That&#39;s why they are the way they are.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But passing that point, after that, everything gets better because then you become strong. You become stronger and you focus, I believe. Once you&#39;re broke down to nothing, what else can you lose? Nothing. You have lost everything. So there&#39;s no way you can roll down. You have to roll up. And that&#39;s what happens. And that&#39;s it. But it does affect a lot</span><span>&nbsp;-</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to a lot of people. To us, to our kids because </span><span>their</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;grades fa</span><span>ll, you know?</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;They have to keep in contact and let them think you&#39;re okay and everything&#39;s fine, but sometimes they feel that it&#39;s not. And they just miss you. And there&#39;s not a lot of ladies or girls that are deported, you know what I mean? The guys are always the ones that get deported you know and everything. </span><span class="c4">Pero</span><span>, t</span><span class="c1">here&#39;s cases like mine that they are scared. And there should be more help for a woman because we need some different kind of help. I am strong woman, and I&#39;m...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you are.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you satisfied with what you&#39;ve told me?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So are you good to stop?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Lilimora</span><span class="c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, no. Thank you.</span></p><p class="c2 c8"><span class="c3 c9"></span></p></body></html>
