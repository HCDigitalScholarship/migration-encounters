And they call sometime and tell us they need people to work at the same place he was working. And that was the reason why I was thinking that it was a great idea. And that was-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m 46 years old now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or how old were you when you decided to go?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 25, 26 years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were&mdash;before that, you had lived your whole life, where?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city, or-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, at the State.

What we say? The six-pack for the Coronas for exportation. And I was working there before.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were working at the Corona factory?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, uh, so when you moved, what did you start working in, in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same factory was my brother-in-law was working. He was working in a wood factory and they worked for Hobby Lobby, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us. They made like toys and all that with the wood.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where was that factory at?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>_____</span><span class="c0">, Georgia.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Georgia.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is your first memory of the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first memory, when I came there, the first time I see everything beautiful. Everything is different, obviously. There&rsquo;s uhm&hellip; it&#39;s a great experience to live somewhere else that you don&#39;t know. And it was my dream from when I was a little kid. I tried to move to Los Angeles when I was a kid, because my... I say in Spanish, my </span><span class="c5 c7">madrina</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;[</span><span>godmother]</span><span class="c0">, her husband has a restaurant in Los Angeles and she tried to take me with her to start a school in Los Angeles but my parents don&#39;t give me a chance to live with her. So when I was at the US, at the first time, at very first time, that was great. Really good experience. I never change it, neither.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you like about it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything, everything. The culture, the people, food, all the places, everything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made it different from Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form, the way you live is totally different. The jobs are different and the pay rate [laughs]. That&#39;s really, really different. Everything. Once you came in Mexico, the first time when you been here after you was living in the US, that&#39;s really hard to be adapted right here in Mexico again. Because you miss your family, you miss the country, the food, the people, everything. You miss everything. And that&#39;s really, really hard when you came to Mexico. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you went to the US, when did you pick up English?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was there. I was helping my daughters to make their homework. That helped me a lot. At the first place when I was working, they take us a teacher because there was a really, really dangerous place to work because we was working with the saws, and I learned too much right there. And watching movies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you had daughters there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three daughters?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they still there or no?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. They&#39;re still living there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your partner?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, with her mom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you meet her in the United States or where did you meet her?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you guys went over together?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were your children born here or were they born-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They born here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they have, at the moment any status, or-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They already permission because they made their school right there. So they was uh, uh, they give us the, they give the permission to the people who was made in the school right there-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, DACA?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Onto high school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that DACA?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DACA.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your daughters got DACA.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DACA.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were growing up, undocumented, your whole family was undocumented? All of them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that experience like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that&#39;s hard, but I don&#39;t find it hard at all, because they was at the school like everybody else. They have, actually, the same rights. There was no discrimination at school at all. And I don&#39;t find that discrimination for me or my family at all. So, that made the difference.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was in Georgia?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Georgia, really huge city.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep south. People think that there&#39;s a lot of racism there. You didn&#39;t experience anything?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Actually, all the people... Well, I was lucky because all the people I met in Georgia, there was really beautiful people, including my supervisors.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure. They like the people who go to work and do the right thing, you know. That&#39;s what they like. When you go to just be drunk and have a party all the time and you don&#39;t like to work, that&#39;s the difference between the people. I mean, they look if you go to do the right thing, that&#39;s all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s the right thing?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You go to work, you help the other people too. They saw that you are part of your family and you take care of them, and all that. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were living in the US since you were 25, when did you come back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When? I guess that was at that year when I was came back to Mexico, is that what you tried to say? In January 2010.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. Yeah, 36.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35, 36.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, your daughters were... Your daughters made the trip from Mexico to the US-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the US.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... with you</span><span>?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, with my sister-in-law.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Your sister-in-law?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my brother.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How&#39;d they do it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They crossed the border.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were they?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were they?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like me, like the first time. Yeah. That&#39;s dangerous. That&#39;s a risk we take. When you try to provide your family with a better life, it doesn&#39;t matter the risk. Yeah. That&#39;s hard. That really hard, but you need to try it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what would you do on your free time when you were in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, actually I never have free time because I was working all the times. I mean, at the first time, when I was working at the factory, after work, we going to home and sometimes go to buy some groceries, the lunch for the week. And I enjoy the time with my wife. After that, when my daughters was up there and when I have a free time, I spend the time with them. I like to go with them to the mall, to the zoo, all of that. Help them with their homework too. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helped them with their homework as they were going through school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I help them a lot. That&#39;s what I learned too much. Yeah. That helped me too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did they speak English at home, or what did they speak at home?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They speak Spanish, their first language, but they learning good. I</span><span>&nbsp;a</span><span class="c0">m too, I got five grandsons and-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... I got five grandsons right now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five grandsons now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And the first one, the big one, he&#39;s the only one who speaks Spanish, really good Spanish. The others, they don&#39;t like to speak Spanish. They understand, but they don&#39;t like to talk, you know. That&#39;s funny.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you left, how old were your daughters?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you were deported back, how old were your daughters?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really hard. The older was pregnant at the time. She already was married and that&#39;s really, really hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how old is she?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, she is 28.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28? So back then, she was like 18?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before... That&#39;s the oldest daughter?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about your other daughters, how old are they?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27 and 25.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it was like 18, 17 and 15, back-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 15 back...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right in their teen years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that hard for you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really hard. Because when I was at the detention center, they come every single day, every hour. That time kind of hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of things would they tell you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They love me. And they want to I&#39;m go back. And the first time I got... So I was at the border.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when you came back, what was your experience in detention like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard part was when they call me every day. That&#39;s a hard time. After that, not at all. Because actually, at the detention center, you made some kind of family with the person who are, they take care of you. I&#39;m not sure why, but I got </span><span>that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lucky all the time. At the place I go, they treat me like family, and that&#39;s good. Actually, after leaving the detention center, I meet with some people from the same detention center, right here in Mexico. And we spent a good time remembering what it was, how it was. And they talk about, they tried to go back to the US, but now they tried to go back with papers, like me. I mean, if I tried to go back, I don&#39;t try to cross the border illegally again. Because, you know, right now, it&#39;s really dangerous and I don&#39;t want to take that risk no more. Not for me, for my daughters, and my parents. So that&#39;s different. You learn to think different at the second time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are any of your daughters studying right now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they already are working now. Two of them are already married and the older, uh, the oldest, she already has a cleaning company, and she is the manager of the apartments. Yeah. At the apartment complex where she&#39;s living now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger ones, did they go to school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they don&#39;t go to school. They only made the high school and they work now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do they work?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are they working?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, she&#39;s working in aquarium. And the other one was helping her big sister at the same place.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s cool.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were treated nicely when you were in detention with ICE?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long were you there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something like a month, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when you came back, what happened?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back? That was hard because you cannot find any job. Because actually, you don&#39;t have papers. In Mexico, you need to do it everything, once again. And when I was here, actually I was 470 pounds on weight. I was size 60 on jeans. Right now, I am 48. When I started to came in here, I&#39;m looking for some help. And my uncle, I have a uncle who told me about the doctor. He&#39;s helping the people to lose weight. And I tried in Toluca right here in the state of Mexico. And he helped me a lot. A lot. Right now I&#39;m 130 kilos and I&#39;m still losing weight. And I&#39;m trying to be, to be good. My health is first now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but at the first time, when I came in here, Mexico, I never hear about these kind of jobs, like a call center where I&#39;m working now. And I work for my own. I opened a taqueria, we calling here. I&#39;m selling tacos, at the first time when I came here. And I&#39;m really good. I mean [laughs], I have a lot of customers. And there was when I... I know my... My actually girlfriend right now. Because let me tell you what, why the first time when you came in Mexico, my wife was calling me every single day, any hour to see how I doing, how I was, see if I need something. After that, she start to call me once a week. After that, a month. After that, she was&hellip; I never hear about her for three years. That&#39;s hard too. But, I mean, if she don&#39;t want to call me and she don&#39;t receive my calls, that&#39;s because she don&#39;t love me, right? She don&#39;t love me no more.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there&#39;s where there was, after six years here in Mexico, I feel alone. I start to be in depression. And I know this girl now who I was... I have a relationship now and I feel better. I take a second chance for me to feel better. And that&#39;s good. I&#39;m even better now. That really, really better. After, I learn about this jobs, I start to working here in Mexico. On my first call center was, </span><span>uhm&hellip; </span><span class="c5">a teleperformance and I love it. The first time I love it. After that, I changed for that job when my mom has a eye surgery, she has like a three months. She cannot do anything. And I quit. So after that, I was working on [inaudible 00:16:50] right here on [inaudible 00:00:16:51]. And after that, I came to work </span><span>in TeleTech</span><span class="c0">. I&#39;m two years now here. I love to work here. That really good. Good experience too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. So, you lived those years where you start a family in the US, because you live for... You left when you were 25, you had already had daughters here-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, but they are not my daughters, my own daughters.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they&#39;re your partner&#39;s?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative). So when I meet her mom, the youngest even don&#39;t start school. The other two, they was at the second year of the elementary. Actually, they were </span><span>grow up</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with me and they call me dad. I&#39;m still being her dad, and that&#39;s good. They&#39;re really, really good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like the reason why you left was for them and for your partner, that time?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s mixed in that way, because one part was for them. And one, for me, </span><span>half and half</span><span class="c0">. At the first time because I want to live the experience to be in the US and got a better life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you feel like you got that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I learn a lot. I learn a lot. Really, really. And everything was good. I take it, everything, like a good experience, even when I was deported because you learn off all that. And that&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were always helping them with their homework, you were always teaching them, was it hard to know that they were undocumented too? Did you ever think about what they were going to go through?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever think about what kind of things they were going to experience being undocumented in the US? Was that in the back of your mind?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some people, everything depends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything depends on what you go to do there. Is you go with, you need to be better, or you try to be better, on your mind at the first time when you go up there, there&#39;s no bad experiences. You&#39;ve got to do what you supposed to be do, everything&#39;s good. I mean, actually you get a bad experience, bad experience is just bad. At the end of the day, you know, and you learn, everything is good, learning when you was there. Even when you have papers or not. Because I knew some people where they have actual papers, they was legally up there, they never do anything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was a guy in special who was working with us, he was a African-American. He was living in a little apartment with all his family. He was the only one who&#39;s working. And they live really bad, really, really bad. And feel proud about us Mexicans, because he saw how the Mexican families are. Everything help together ones each other. And he was thinking, why I don&#39;t born in Mexico? He told me one time, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c5">I love the Mexican families.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Myself, all depends on how you are, or the culture you have. And he told me one time</span><span>,</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c5">when you go back to Mexico, take me with you. I want to live with you.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Actually, he called me &ldquo;cousin,&rdquo; you know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all depends. All depends. If you go to grow up and have a good life and grow up, up there, everything will be good for you. You don&#39;t have any bad experiences at all, even when you have. Because I can tell you, when I was at the jail, when they took me to the jail, that was a bad experience. But now, all, I take it like a good experiences to learn and thinking twice to do it one more time, you know. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So now that you&#39;re back, you said that you found a new partner. Do you feel like you want to go back to the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to visit. Just to visit, not to live. Just to visit and do some kind of business. That&#39;s what I taught with my old daughter and explain her. If I go back, I don&#39;t go to live right there. I&#39;m just going to visit for, actually one month, and then go back. After that six months I&#39;m here in Mexico, I can go back and visit you again. And I don&#39;t think living there because there&#39;s not like your country. There&#39;s nothing like your family. I learning that. I mean, US is really, really, really beautiful place to live, if you born there. You need to be at the place where you belong. That&#39;s what I learning here. I mean, right here, I feel free. I mean, up there, I feel free too, but I need to take care of the police and the immigration, you know. It&#39;s like right here in Mexico. It&#39;s the same thing. It&#39;s exactly the same.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But right here in Mexico, I love my country. This is a really, really beautiful place. And there&#39;s a lot of places we never know, because we don&#39;t have time. And I feel better now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like you&#39;ve ever been discriminated because you lived in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico, for my weight, I cannot find any job. Like I told you, when I was here, I was 470 pounds and nobody want to hire me for the same thing. Right now, everything is different. Everything. Everything is different. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what, uh, now, you said you had a taco stand?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not right now. I still have my</span><span>...</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;all the things for my taqueria on my home, but I don&#39;t try to selling right now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why&#39;s that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was sick when I was selling the first time. I have like a infection for the same thing to be on the hot places. And they tell me I cannot be on the same place anymore for a long time. That&#39;s the reason why. And there&#39;s when I found this kind of job, so that&#39;s why I told you everything happens for something. There&#39;s a reason to happen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with your daughters over there, do you ever send them money or do they ever send you money?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more. No more. At the first time, yes. At the first time they send me money all the time, because I don&#39;t have a job. I need to go to the doctor visits and all that. But now, right now, no, not at all. I mean, just when it&#39;s my birthday or the Father&#39;s Day, they send me something, but not like before. And that&#39;s good for me too. I need to work. I need to be working. I mean, yeah, but it&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think if you would&#39;ve gone to the US as a child, things would have been different?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes, I&#39;m not sure if for good or for bad, but everything will be different. I think that was for good because my madrina [godmother], she is like really Catholic. And her daughters, they went to the high school and the college and two of them now are lawyers. And I think that was a good experience for me too. I mean, everything will be different, but we never know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you left, when you were 25, what did you leave behind?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents, my brother. When I was here, some of the reasons that made me take that decision was my oldest brother was murdered. They tried to take a truck he has, and he resist, and he was killed. That was a year before I leave. I left bad memories, but I still have bad memories in my head. You never forget when you lose somebody closer. In this case, my brother. You learn to live with the pain, but you never forget. And that was one of the things that make me leave Mexico at that time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your parents tell you anything?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#39;t want I leave, but when I talk with them and explain them, they tell me, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s good. God bless you. You need something, you can come back anytime.&quot; Yeah. That was hard too, but not really hard because you was with your... You are leaving your country with the new experience on your mind. How that was. How can I be? What you will find on other place? You know, you are like a little kid. And that&#39;s what helped me a lot. A lot. And that&#39;s cool. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 years, it&#39;s a long time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 years. I never thinking back for real. I told you, for real, I never thinking back. If they don&#39;t get me, I never came back. And there was just for because my driver license expires a day before they stopped me. When I was at jail, immigration was there already. And they don&#39;t give me any chance to pay my ticket.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they got you for an expired license, that&#39;s what led to your deportation?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. Yeah, because at that year, when I was at the jail, there was a law to immigration was on all the jails to take back to Mexico, other countries, to the people with felonies, for the&hellip; not for no license with you. But they got me at the same time when I go to the jail, immigration was with me at the same time on jail. That&#39;s when they taking my information, immigration was there and asked me if I have a social. I said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;Okay, then you&#39;re going with me now.&quot; I told you. But I learning, everything happens for some reason, everything. And that&#39;s good. Between all the bad can be some... There&#39;s a good thing in all that. It all depends how you take it. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you trying to make the best out of your time in Mexico now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m trying to grow up in my own country. There&#39;s a lot of things you can do in here. You can do anything. There&#39;s nobody who told you, you cannot, only you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you feel like you left part of yourself in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. Not really. Now, no. Before, yes. At the first time, yes. But now, no. Because I know my daughters are with me all the times. I have in touch with them every single day. And that&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has your experience in the US shaped who you are today?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good. That was a good experience. Like I told you before, all depends how you take it. Everything I learn, I really thankful with US, for all I learned in there. All I do in there was perfect. That&#39;s what everything was with. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we&#39;re finished with all the questions that we have for today.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have any other last comments or something on your mind?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hugo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all. Thank you for your time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, thank you. Thank you</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
