This is Claudia. I&#39;m interviewing </span><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">. Thanks for coming to talk. And I just want to say that I understand that sometimes talking about these things can be a little difficult because you&#39;re just kind of here just experiencing emotions and you don&#39;t want to relive. But I think it&#39;s important to hear stories like yours and to understand the realities of migration and the human side. So thank you so much for coming out and talking to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. I just want to say that. Yeah, I&#39;m trying to say as much as I can, trying to share as much as I can. Basically, I was living in the States since I was like three years old. I went to school and I just always liked doing bad stuff. And where I lived, it was almost like that&#39;s where everything was going on. You know what I mean? Everything was bad. And I just got really involved with a gang and just started doing gang stuff, gang violence, gang stuff, robberies, all that. And I mean, I thought the gang was my life. It really closed my eyes to where like all I thought about was my gang. You know what I mean? Every single day I was with them. It was like my brothers. Until this day, like, I still miss all that. And that&#39;s crazy because I know it didn&#39;t take me nowhere. And it&#39;s just crazy. I lost my family, basically, like It&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the United States or were you too young for that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I&#39;m always going to remember my first field trip, you know, like in school, when I was little. I&#39;m always going to remember my first field trip to the circus. After that, I never had a field trip. It&rsquo;s just, like I mean was always like, &quot;Now you&#39;re good. Just stay home.&quot; I had to stay home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that you couldn&#39;t have had a future?

My dad was always, he wasn&#39;t on chores. H</span><span class="c1">e had&hellip; </span><span class="c2 c1">He was a little like, he was cool. I&#39;m not going to talk bad about him because he was cool. But it wasn&#39;t cool at the time, because you know what I mean? I just&hellip;I never seen him hit my mom. He was always, he had other girls, you know what I mean? He has a family. He has a different family right now. And it&#39;s cool, like I understand. I understand, I&#39;m a man, you know what I mean? You want to have all the feelings, but at the end of the day, like right now as I&#39;m growing up and I&#39;m seeing that I got a kid on my own? It&#39;s just not cool. It&#39;s not cool. I know one day she&#39;s, you know what I mean? She&#39;s going to be like, &quot;Oh, what&#39;s up with you?&quot; I don&#39;t want to go through that because&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me about your life in the states, and basically how you got involved in the gang and all that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, it was like I said, it was always since like day one, you know what I mean? What is it like second, third grade? You know what I mean? We&#39;re doing bad stuff. My friend, it&#39;s just like in school, you know what I mean? We&#39;re getting into trouble. We&#39;re fighting, we&#39;re getting suspended. We&#39;re on the bus doing this, and the third, [inaudible 00:03:18] they&#39;re stopping the bus. We&#39;re doing dumb stuff in school. And I always remember, my friend, my closest friend, I still talk to him to this day. His brother was [Gang name]. And he just, you know what I mean? Brought us in, into it, just bringing this, bringing this. We just start meeting people and it was just, you know what I mean? You feel loved, and you feel you like this. You know what I mean? It&#39;s brotherhood. It&#39;s just brotherhood. At the end of the day, it&#39;s just all brotherhood. I&#39;m realizing now, you feel me? But as I talk about it, I like it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which one were you a part of?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which one, gang?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[gang name]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were [gang name] And how was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was cool to me.

And I was out, I got released October, 2014.

It was all right. You know what I mean? It was leaned back. Everybody&#39;s trying to get home. Nobody&#39;s really doing too much. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how was it coming back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c1 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was cool. I guess, I was just happy to be out. And when I came here, I was in the </span><span class="c1">el rancho,</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;in the campo. I was</span><span class="c1">&hellip;</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;My uncle, he was doing the </span><span class="c1 c3 c15">huachicol</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;you know about that? It was like people, they were stealing gas and shit. My uncle was doing that when I came o</span><span class="c1">ut</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;here. So, you know me, I was like, &quot;Okay, yeah.&quot; I&#39;m with this thing I said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And what&#39;s been the hardest part about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, everything. You know what I mean? Sometimes just [inaudible 00:07:21] like people just talk bad about you, telling them that you hate them. You on the same on bus, you&#39;re sitting right next to me, buddies, you know what I mean? I was very cool, like whatever man. It&#39;s cool. Like you can&#39;t come in, you&#39;re going to start robbing people. Like, &quot;All right, whatever. Cool, man. I&#39;m going to work. I don&#39;t know what you talking about. It&#39;s five in the morning. I don&#39;t think nobody&#39;s going to try to rob you at five in the morning.&quot; Fucking poser. But it&#39;s cool. It&#39;s just stuff that I already know it&#39;s coming, you feel me? I already know from when I was, it&#39;s cool. But I always say my willpower is stronger than faith, so I know I&#39;m going to be all right one day, as long as I want to be all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c1 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that&#39;s all that I could really say. I&#39;m not going to lie. Like I got a lot of stories, but I don&#39;t want to say anything, like too many details, you heard? </span><span class="c1">B</span><span class="c2 c1">ut I do want to help people out. I want to be able to help people out. I think I really... Even as my job, just by helping people out with their own shit that they got going on with... they&#39;re too dumb to know what&#39;s going on with their TV or whatever. But I don&#39;t mean like volunteering or whatever. By helping the community, man, you know what I mean? Because you&#39;re not going to get nowhere as a country in general. And I don&#39;t want to sound like, &quot;Oh, centered in Mexico,&quot; but I mean, that&#39;s where I&#39;m from and I want to help my people out. You know what I mean? It&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just bad how you got a lot of people, a lot of homeless people that just doing drugs. And they&#39;re doing drugs that are cheap, right? You know what I mean? Like 10 cents, 10 pesos. And it&#39;s okay for them to do it in the street, you feel me? Why can&#39;t they pick them up already? Take &lsquo;em somewhere or some shit. Even authorities themselves, why can&#39;t... I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t understand, but it&#39;s cool. But I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what it is that I just want to help. You know what I mean? I want to try and give back and shit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still involved with [gang name] here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s crazy you say that, but I&#39;m not. I was. When I came back, I first came back, and I was showing up. You know what I mean? Like, &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot; I&#39;m out here. For me, that&#39;s when you realize you just got out of jail and you&#39;re just like, &quot;What the fuck? I&#39;m high as hell.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Well, damn.&quot; I looked around and started looking around like... [inaudible 00:09:28] was going to happen to me.

I&#39;m not taking you.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Damn. That&#39;s crazy. Say no more. It&#39;s cool, it&#39;s cool.&rdquo; And that&#39;s the only thing I remember from those days, and that&#39;s crazy. Because that&#39;s the only thing, I don&#39;t remember nothing else.

I was doing the same thing I was doing in the streets, but at the end of the day I realized that that&#39;s not... It&#39;s no good. But like, &nbsp;I liked it and I&#39;m not going to lie. I liked it. I could say I liked it because I, you </span><span class="c1">know what I mean</span><span class="c2 c1">? I learned a little bit things from jail. So that&#39;s cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has it been like being separated from your parents and your siblings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, at the end of the day, like I said, like I just tried to cope with everything. I just try to deal with it. You know what I mean? I don&#39;t try to focus too much on it. At the end of the day, I&#39;m not going to be sorry for something that I was already doing. I was over here keeping myself away from my family. You know what I mean? My mom, she was like, &quot;Yo, let&#39;s go to church.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not going to church. You bugging, ma.&quot; But that was just my mom. I talk to my mom. I would never curse or put my hands on her, but that was just me. And I&#39;m not going, you bugging, ma. You crazy. &quot;Oh yeah? You don&#39;t want to go now?&quot; You&#39;re not going anywhere outside. It&#39;s cold. I&#39;ll stay in. I&#39;m not going to church on Sunday. But I mean, I was already doing it. But I&#39;m cool now. Like &nbsp;I just try to chill. Like I said, I have a faith, hope on them, we&rsquo;ll see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So have you ever either at home or in Mexico been discriminated against for being a returning migrant?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no, not really. Just within the family, for me, within the family. I know how that goes. But other than that...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Y</span><span class="c2 c1">eah. And do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexican, 100%. I&#39;ve always been known as that Mexican.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you could have stayed in the United States, what do you think you might have done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get in trouble again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I guess now that you&#39;re back in Mexico, what are your dreams or what would you like to do? Of course, helping people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, like, I ain&#39;t got no goal. My goal was to just go back since I got here since day one. I just kept like, you know what I mean, I was stealing gas now. I thought I knew everything. I come out here, people stealing gas. Oh, let me do this too. I mean, I&#39;m doing drugs, I&#39;m doing crystal meth, I&#39;m smoking this shit like... I&#39;m up for three days, four, just like, &quot;Oh, shit. What&#39;s going on?&quot; You know what I mean? We stealing, we getting money. It don&#39;t matter, we drunk. We&#39;re not even getting drunk. We just off the crystal, you know what I mean? And to this day, I haven&#39;t done it for like, a whole month already, you feel me? I try to keep myself... I&#39;m trying to focus. Even when I was working here, I came over here, I mean... I was like, &quot;Fuck it.&quot; People don&#39;t do this shit here, people are doing other shit. Cool. But I&#39;m just going to smoke my weed, do what I was doing already. Not anything new. But I met guys and we just started sniffing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I would be sniffing this crystal shit, I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, shit.&quot; And I&#39;m just like, &quot;What the fuck?&quot; And then, &quot;Damn. No, this is not me, bro.&quot; Like, &quot;What am I getting into?&quot; You know what I mean? Like I said, and I only got a month and I knew if I could do it, somebody else can do it. I want to be able to help people. You feel me? There&#39;s a lot of people that speak English and I know who get a job. And they out there stealing, robbing, doing drugs, you feel me? Come on, bro. I know if they could see some type of hope. I don&#39;t know. Maybe they might like it. But give them a chance to see something. Because at the end of the day, they think they not going nowhere, you feel me? They going to end up dead or in jail. And I just want to let them see that hope, you know what I mean? It&#39;s there, homie, just chill out. Patience is everything. Patience is everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So this is my last question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m curious to see what you think. Why do young Mexican men in the United States turn to crime and gangs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn. Just the family, I guess. It sounds crazy. But maybe at the end of the day, it is part of the family. It was crazy, but that&#39;s really what it comes down to at end of the day. Maybe my mom would have been cool, my dad... I don&#39;t know, you feel me? I don&#39;t blame my mom for nothing, but at the end of the day, you feel me? I take responsibility, but I don&#39;t know, you feel me? I always thought about it. You know what I mean? What if it would&#39;ve been cool, if&hellip; Fuck it. You know what I mean? What if my pops didn&#39;t have so many other kids? What&#39;s up with that? You know what I mean? Maybe he would&#39;ve whooped my and ass instead. I don&#39;t know, you feel me? From smoking in the house, like I don&#39;t know. You feel me? Damn. My mom&#39;s a female. She gets tired and she&#39;ll just be like, &quot;Fuck it. You fucking doing it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s all I have. Now just a time that I give you to say anything else that you might want to add? Or whatever you want to say?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get a chance to help people out. I want to help. That&#39;s all I ask for is I want to help, man. Help myself out too as well. It&#39;s not easy. I mean, it&#39;s not easy. What&#39;s your name again? I forgot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claudia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not easy, Claudia. It&#39;s not easy. Now you feel me? I just do [inaudible 00:17:10] that I can, but I want to be able to help him out a little more. Now he&#39;s doing good, don&#39;t get me wrong. But maybe we could one day stop and just be sober. You know what I mean? I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ll get there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think so?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bryan</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I got it. I&#39;ve always, you know what I mean? I&#39;ve got potential. I know I do. I&#39;m smooth. But it&#39;s just at the end of the day, I don&#39;t know.
