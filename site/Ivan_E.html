Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember what it was like, when you arrived? I sometimes ask that question.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I remember when I arrived I was-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That first day, what was it like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was beautiful. The houses. It was clean. I thought everywhere was Disneyland, because it looked like the Disneyland houses, you know how every one&#39;s different. I remember we lived in a garage. We couldn&#39;t afford a room. But it was my dad, my mom, and my sister. We had one bed, and a TV, and a sofa.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So four of you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was excited. Yeah, it was the four of us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So four of you shared a bed?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My dad was, he worked for Quicksilver. Quicksilver.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quicksilver, like the clothing company.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, clothing company. My mom worked as a housekeeper.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a garment worker?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in packing. He used to pack stuff. I liked it. I loved it. My first word in English was &quot;please&quot;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Who taught you that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because when I got my first day in school, everyone, like the whole kids, &quot;Oh please, teacher. Please, please.&quot; Everybody was saying &quot;please&quot;, so I was like, &quot;What does this mean?&quot; It sounded nice, you know. So that was my first word.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know what it meant?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, at first I didn&#39;t, but then I learned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you still like it when you found out what it was?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I loved it. Of course. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you like school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved ... I was really good in school. I was on O-Club. I was really good. I actually got a sponsor to go to college and all that, but my parents got divorced when I was like 11. That affected me a lot. The American dream became a nightmare, because my mom had to work a lot, and I got introduced to drugs when I was pretty young, when I was 13. I got involved in gangs. That changed my life. It changed my life. But now I&#39;ve been clean for seven years now. I do counseling. I do AA, and I-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you talk about what happened a little bit, with your mom and your dad? What happened?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom had three children here in Mexico. My dad was kind of </span><span class="c1 c7">machista</span><span class="c0">. You know, he told me, &quot;It&#39;s only us. Forget about them.&quot; And my mom brought them to the States without my dad knowing. When he found out, he got really mad. He left the house.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom had to work a lot. It was only my sister and I at the house. I remember in school the Mexican-Americans and the Mexican immigrants, we got discriminated a lot by the Mexican-Americans. They used to call us &ldquo;wetbacks.&rdquo; They used to call us names. We didn&#39;t know a lot about the language, &nbsp;you &nbsp;know the culture. And one time, one of my friends got bullied by one of the Mexican-Americans. I defended him, so I got in a fight. And they beat me up, like five Mexican-American kids.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went back to the neighborhood, they saw me bleeding and all that, all these guys. &quot;What happened? Who fucked you up?&quot; &quot;It was those guys, the guys from the other neighborhood, the Mexican-American kids.&quot; So the next day the whole neighborhood came over to defend me. To me, that was like, &quot;They love me,&quot; you know? &quot;They care about me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a lot of insecurity with my dad, because he left. (emotional) It affected me a lot. I love my dad, so they became like my family. That&#39;s why I got dragged into it, in the beginning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 12.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were 12 when this happened?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was 12. I still did good in school. I started working when I was like 15, with a fake social security and a fake ID, because my mom didn&#39;t make enough money. So I started working pretty young. I used to work like from 6:00 to 3:00 in the morning, so I would only sleep like three, four hours, and then go to school. Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexican-Americans discriminated against-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, Mexican ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigrants?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... immigrants, yes. We got more discriminated by them, than with White people or Asians, or Blacks.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? I mean, you&#39;re a psychologist now. How do you explain that? What do you think?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&#39;s more in the culture that, I think that&#39;s why the culture is like this. We are very patriots, you know we love being Mexicans. But there&#39;s a lot of envy. There&#39;s a lot of, &quot;If you do better than I do, I don&#39;t like you.&quot; Americans don&#39;t have that. It&#39;s part of the culture. They felt like Americans, you know? And when they ... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean, they felt that they were better than you, or they were insecure that you were going to be better than them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they felt better than us. They felt better than us. But then, I tried my best learning English. I got into the football team, and I got adapted to the culture. I even denied I was Mexican, when I was young. I always told people, &quot;I&#39;m a Mexican-American.&quot; It was a lie, I know, but because I loved the ... I grew up over there. I felt American. I love the politics. I love history. I was involved in ... But then, when I was like in high school, in my freshman year, I wanted to leave, because in the history book they only had like four pages about the Mexican history: the Aztecs, the Mexican-American War, and a few things more. You know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And about the Revolution. But I wanted to learn more. Like, Americans didn&#39;t like you because you&#39;re not White. You have to be White. But Mexicans didn&#39;t like you either, because you don&#39;t have their culture. So we&#39;re like in-between.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You felt in-between in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And even here, too. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but in the US too, you felt in-between.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the US.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why were you so fascinated by Mexico? As a-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I wanted-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... as a teenager?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... to belong to something. I wanted to be proud of something, something that might motivate me to do good, you know? Like I wanted to, I&#39;d learned a lot about the Aztecs, the Mayans, the Aztlan, the Olmecas, and I wanted to know why America was such a great country. It wasn&#39;t Mexico if ... I love geography. I love the culture and all that, so why, if we&#39;re such a good country, we have all this natural incomes, like we got the oil, we got the land, we got all this, we&#39;re beautiful. Why are we a terrible country? That was always-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why are we a terrible country&quot;?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, a third world country.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third-world country.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Why? Why? Why? Why the Americans succeeded, and why we didn&#39;t, you know? That was always, it got into the history and all that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is as a young teenager you&#39;re talking about.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes, that was as a ... I&#39;m in love with history, with politics. That&#39;s part of me. But when I got into those two drugs, and gangs, I failed my objective. I failed it. I got lost.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it seems to me like you were doing both at the same time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was kind of doing both.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were working.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you manage to do all these three things?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, and when my dad was with us, they always encouraged us to work hard, to do good, to always ... like, if you don&#39;t work, you don&#39;t deserve a plate, you know? To us, working was a priority. Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t really encourage me with the education. But I liked it. I liked it. I liked going to school. Right now, I&#39;m 35, and I&#39;m going to school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they didn&#39;t emphasize school as much as working, your parents?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, no. It wasn&#39;t a priority in our family. No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This came from something within you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. How did the gangs that you were hanging out with feel about your interests in history, and politics, and school, and-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they thought I was stupid. Once I hit prison, I got involved with trafficking drugs. When I hit the prison, they encouraged me to, &quot;Man, bro, like&quot; ... It becomes a different ... like the homies in there, the people that were involved in the gangs, like educate yourself. We need smart people, you know? We have a lot of stupid people, na&iuml;ve people already. We want people to study. And I love reading, so I became a reader.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prison?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In prison, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. I want to come back. But I want to go back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the gangs say? How did the gangs think of your interest in all these things, or did you keep it secret from them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was kind of like my private life. Being a gang member, it was about taking care of the neighborhood, and being in fights with other gangs. It&#39;s about the money. You know, hustling. I didn&#39;t steal. I never </span><span>stole</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;anything or assault anybody. It was most drugs, drug-selling. You know, selling drugs and all that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, you left history and all those passions and education. You chose the other.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I became an addict at a young age. I became an addict. Now I&#39;m... My first drug was meth, methamphetamines. That was powerful. I never did weed, marijuana, cocaine, nothing. I stayed with meth, and it became a problem in my life for a long time. For a long time. I think that&#39;s why I got deported from the United States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you trafficked drugs from Mexico into the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. We used to manufacture it. We used to cook it, and send it to-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You manufactured it locally, in the US, and then-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, in the US. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s why we can&#39;t buy Sudafed anymore.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s your fault! Every time I get a sinus headache, I get mad at you guys.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. I was part of that. I was part of that. But that&#39;s my past. That&#39;s the past. My life changed here. I&#39;m actually, now I&#39;m grateful that God brought me here. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you get involved in all of that, and then what happened? You got arrested?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got arrested. I would get arrested and get released, get arrested and get released. After 9/11, the whole game changed. All of a sudden I had an INS hold.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An INS hold. Yeah. And they told me I was going to get deported. I got deported, and then I went back. But then I couldn&#39;t stop doing drugs. It was really hard. I got married very young. Then my wife is over there, my daughter too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when you got married?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 20. 20 years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this to a gang member?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I got married and my daughter was born ... I left the gang side of it like when I was 18. It wasn&#39;t for me anymore.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you didn&#39;t meet your girlfriend through the gangs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No. She&#39;s actually a good Christian girl. Yeah, she doesn&#39;t smoke. She doesn&#39;t drink. She goes to school. She&#39;s going to college. She treated my daughter ... I mean, she&#39;s an excellent mom. But she got tired of my addiction. There were times when I would try to work, but there were times when I would relapse and start in on that process again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever go to rehab?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never wanted to go to rehab. I&#39;m religious. I believe in ... I&#39;m a Christian, and I always thought that through Christianity I was going to stop doing drugs. But it takes more than that. It takes more than that to get me off. Now that I&#39;m studying psychology, it&#39;s psychology, it&#39;s your body, your </span><span class="c1 c7">biolog&iacute;a</span><span class="c0">, your social and your spiritual, all those four things are combined. You can&#39;t not, just through prayer, or just because I feel good in the sermon I&#39;m going to stop doing drugs. It takes more than that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask you a question, because of how we&#39;re having this conversation. Part of this project was also so that American citizens can better understand migrants. This is why I love what I&#39;m doing, so that we understand we&#39;re all human beings. We make mistakes. Some of us don&#39;t make mistakes, but for kids, we grow up, we ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were to explain to ... If like I say, &quot;Okay, I met this incredible former gang member and meth dealer.&quot; And somebody says, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; How would you explain so that an American can understand why kids like you are drawn into this world? Like what is it about ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, it has-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it something about US society? Is it something about the way you live? How do you see it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to do with the culture. It has to do with, a lot of us, when we immigrate to the United States, you see we come from these third-world countries. All of a sudden, you&#39;re able to reach to anything. Everything, it&#39;s available to you. If you want to go to high school, college, you have all these good, positive options. But what happens with my culture is that we&#39;re running away from poverty. We want money. We want to eat. We want to have a house.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we get there ... like I remember I wanted to get, I wanted to do things right, you know? I wanted to get a job. I wanted to go to college. But since I was an immigrant, I couldn&#39;t. It was too expensive. You are always under the table, you know? And with, I believe the family&#39;s the most important thing. That&#39;s something Mexicans have, very strongly. They believe that, in family. But when you go over there, we as migrants, we have to work two jobs. My mama had to work two jobs. And unfortunately, they separate it, and you don&#39;t have the resources or the encouragement to ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask you another </span><span>question about</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that. Is there something about, a lot of people talk about their families breaking up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that the strain of the amount of work you need to do? Is that, why do so many Mexican families break up, in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe if you don&#39;t have have ambition, </span><span class="c1 c7">ambici&oacute;n</span><span class="c1">, if you don&#39;t have </span><span class="c1 c7">una meta</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, a goal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... a goal, you have nothing. You could have the best family. You could be very smart. But if you don&#39;t have </span><span class="c1 c7">ambici&oacute;n</span><span class="c1">, we don&#39;t have a purpose. You get that through education, through ... I believe a lot of Mexican-Americans, a lot of Mexicans that migrate over, they&#39;re very na&iuml;ve. They don&#39;t take education as </span><span>important as</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;you guys do. And because money through drugs, through trafficking, it&#39;s easy, we get involved with that. We want the good cars, we want </span><span>a</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;house. And since we&#39;re illegal, it&#39;s really hard to get that, so we go through that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think if people weren&#39;t illegal, that there would be less gangs, that there would be less trouble? That kids would ... I mean what is it? Is it the strain of having to work so hard, on the family? I&#39;m just trying to figure it out, as somebody who&#39;s sympathetic. I want to tell the positive. What can we do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of, we lose our culture. I think it has to do with the culture a lot, because we don&#39;t belong to nobody. You know? We lose our culture. We don&#39;t have a vision, and we don&#39;t have a purpose. A lot of these young kids don&#39;t have metas, they don&#39;t have goals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now I&#39;m a counselor. I&#39;ve worked in the clinic, and here it&#39;s a little bit different. Poor people in Mexico is different than poor people in the United States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here, the economy, you could be poor but you&#39;re good, right? In the States, if you&#39;re poor most likely you&#39;re an addict. Most likely you&#39;re lazy, because you have all these opportunities over there, if you&#39;re a citizen. Like I remember when I was in county jail, they told, &quot;If you&#39;re convicted and you want to go to college, the government will pay you to go to school. But you got to be a citizen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to join the Army, when the war was going on. I couldn&#39;t, because I wasn&#39;t legal. Like, I wanted to belong to something. I wanted to be part of society, and we&#39;re always under the table.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangs offer you a sense of belonging.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Gangs, that sense of belonging. At first, you go with their sight. Oh, they have cars. They have girls. They&#39;ve got money. Unfortunately, I believe there&#39;s a meth epidemic through the whole country, and now it&#39;s infected the Mexican communities too. We have it in the northern states of Mexico, in Sonora, in Sinaloa, all those northern states. We have a lot of ... I believe that has a huge impact on our community. Yeah, it&#39;s a big deal. That&#39;s why I love to do what I do, because I&#39;m a survivor, you know? I&#39;m not an addict. I&#39;m a survivor. I consider myself a survivor. I consider myself with a purpose.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your message get through to kids here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes. I sponsor about 20 kids. Young adults. I do coaching leadership. I do AA, and I do spiritual. I&#39;m a Christian as well, but I&#39;ll only work with people that want to receive the word of God, you know? If you&#39;re not Christian, I respect that. We have other ways to work with you. The plan here is to have a spiritual awakening, to have a purpose, to have new values, new principles, that you put before your emotions. Mexicans are very emotional. We&#39;re high tension, almost </span><span class="c1 c7">col&eacute;ricos&hellip; nos guiamos por </span><span class="c7">nuestras </span><span class="c1 c7">emociones</span><span class="c0">. (we are driven by our emotions) It has to do with the culture, too, you know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do know what you mean. Are there as many broken homes in Mexico, as there were of Mexicans living in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. There&#39;s more broken homes in the US.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the culture shock they get, when they arrive to the United States, I think. That&#39;s what I think.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture shock. How does that impact your families?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New language. New society, new rules.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American. American.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You answered that right away.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I have no doubt.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about you is American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the same... First of all because of the religion probably, too. There&#39;s a lot of more Protestants over there. The way I was brought up, the spirit of the American dream. Now I&#39;m doing my American dream in Mexico. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is. Because it&#39;s not a matter of a border. It&#39;s </span><span class="c1 c7">tu identidad&hellip; tu pensamiento</span><span class="c0">. (it&rsquo;s your identity&hellip;. your way of thinking) It&#39;s in your mind. It&#39;s not the country. It&#39;s the spirit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that if you hadn&#39;t lived in the US, you would be doing all this coaching work and working with drug addicts? Is that something also that comes from your experience in the US? It&#39;s a bit of a leading question. I should have asked that in a different way, but what do you think?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I believe in predestination.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In predestination.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That things are predestined.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My belief is that God allowed all that, so I could do this now. My experience, my dad leaving the house, the gangs, the drugs, my failure in marriage, all that, now I can use it as a positive thing to help others. Like, I don&#39;t see it as a bad or a good. I see it as an experience, now. And with that, if I&#39;m talking to you, I could have empathy with you, and I could work with you, and I could guide you through my experience. Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many children do you have?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a daughter.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A daughter who&#39;s an American.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see her? Have you seen her?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Messenger, on her mom. She&#39;s legal in the States, but she can&#39;t leave the United States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mom, yeah. Once she gets her documents then, like, she&#39;s going to be able to come. I lived in TJ, Tijuana for four years, because my dad would bring my daughter to the border. I was two hours away from the border. But in Tijuana, in the northern states, there&#39;s a lot of drug addicts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had to get away.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wasn&#39;t helping. I needed to get away. It was, first I have to love myself in order to love you. First I got to be right with me, you know what I&#39;m saying, to be able ... I had to learn that. Yeah. At first it was, &quot;Oh, my daughter. My daughter, I want to see my daughter.&quot; But I would relapse. I was always try to do good. Like I always wanted to function in society. But something about meth addiction, you can&#39;t function. If you&#39;re a cocaine addict, you could probably work and have a family, and still manage your addiction, if you smoke marijuana, or alcohol. But with meth you can&#39;t do that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? What does meth do to you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meth, there&#39;s a few processes when you become, is when you only try it, when you only experience, when you become abusive, and then when you become a dependent. There&#39;s three steps. With meth, you go from experiencing to depending on it. It&#39;s very addictive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it very quick?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick. Quick. I believe it&#39;s more addictive than heroin, because it eats in your mind. Eats in your mind. I believe it&#39;s only one out of 100 meth addicts makes it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re one of 100.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I&#39;m special. I am very special. I believe that. I believe God has a purpose in my life. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happens to the others? Do they just overdose and die?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You don&#39;t get an overdose with meth, unless you do it like a lot, a lot. But it affects your central nervous system, your dopamine. I mean, it&#39;s terrible. You get meth mouth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get organ failure, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You don&#39;t sleep, you don&#39;t eat. You get paranoid. You can get schizophrenic with meth. I mean, it&#39;s crazy. It&#39;s crazy. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you do meth, instead of coke, or heroin, or anything?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the first drug I tried, it was meth, and when I tried coke, it didn&#39;t do anything. Meth is 10 times stronger than cocaine, 10 times, and 10 times more addictive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 years old, when I first started.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were 13 years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I was 13.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were a little boy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was. I was a little boy. Yeah. Even when I was in football and all that, I would smoke in the bathrooms. I would start shaking. I thought it was, I couldn&#39;t control it. But that&#39;s what we want to stop here. Prevention. We&#39;re doing a lot of prevention here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite that, you still played high school football?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite being a meth addict.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How&#39;d you manage to do that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hard. Meth isolated me a lot. I&rsquo;m&hellip; </span><span class="c1 c7">soy muy extrovertido</span><span class="c1">, (very extroverted) extrovert. Meth got me to the other side, </span><span class="c1 c7">introvertido</span><span class="c0">. (introverted) I had to stay quiet and all that. If there&#39;s drugs, I think drug addiction in the United States, I mean you know the United States is the number one in the world that consumes drugs. That&#39;s why you have all these problems. I think it has to ... It destroys the family, especially with migrants. Yeah. I think it&#39;s one of the main reasons why Mexicans fail at the American dream. To me it&#39;s a big problem. That&#39;s what I-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that if American society was more welcoming-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you know what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it, who&#39;s ... I mean, we know-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#39;s put Trump on one side, right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. My experience with Americans, it was great. They loved us. They loved my mom. They had always helped us. They always gave me, I always, &quot;Why are they so happy? Why do they succeed?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do they succeed? Why are they so ... They have a purpose. Like most Americans go to college. Not every, not in general, but the people I used to hang around with. I always wanted to imitate the American culture, you know? Even here in Mexico when I work, I&#39;m like, &quot;You look so confident of yourself.&quot; Because I got it from over there. I loved the American culture. I loved it. I loved it. I always dreamed of having a house, drinking tea and reading my book, and I&#39;d decorate my house American style, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would that be?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;d do it. I have it now.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it like, American style?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I love it. I love it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does your house look like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Americans&#39;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got </span><span class="c1 c7">cuadros</span><span class="c0">. (paintings) I got roses and I got my bookshelf, something Mexicans don&#39;t have, because we don&#39;t read that much. I got my sofa. I got my carpet, you know? Because I&#39;m used to it up there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t have a white fence though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don&#39;t. No I don&#39;t. No I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t. But yeah, it&#39;s-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well. One last question. In prison, what was it like, being not a citizen?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wouldn&#39;t count that much. It&#39;s more about the culture.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More about what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More about the culture. At the end I became like the Mexican-Americans. But I never discriminated my people. Never. I always helped them. I was like, &quot;Bro, you need something? Bro, you need a translation? I&#39;d help you out.&quot; I was always like that. In prison, Mexicans are divided into three groups. The Northerns, the South, and the Paisos, which are the migrants. I was a Southern, because I belonged to a gang in Southern California, and I got tattooed so I couldn&#39;t deny it. But after a few months, I started ... That&#39;s what-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who were the Northerns?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From northern California. Yeah, they&#39;re more like the farmers, people from the farms, from the grapes and strawberries, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So the Southerners were the people of the gangs of LA, and the Northerners were the farmers, and then there were the migrants.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immigrants, yeah, the Paisos. But I was tired of it. I wanted to free my soul. I wanted to become free from meth. I wanted to become ... It was really hard for me. I knew it was affecting my life since I was really young, and I became religious in jail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In jail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In jail. I became religious. But at that time, when you become all spiritual, you become double </span><span class="c1 c7">moral</span><span class="c0">&hellip; you can&rsquo;t&hellip;That&rsquo;s not good either, you know? That&#39;s not good. After that, I learned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did these three groups of Mexicans fight each other?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes. Unless we got in trouble with the Blacks. We united.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Southerns, they were really cool with Whites. And Whites also have a few groups, like skinheads, peckerwoods, and Nazis.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a minute. Skinheads and Nazis were different?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. They&#39;re different things. Yeah. Peckerwoods-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are peck, peck-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peckerwoods.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are peckerwoods?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re more like bikers, probably? Yeah. Then you have the Mexicans. But since the Mexicans control the whole jail system-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they do. They do. I mean, in the dorm of 100 people, you would have 16 Mexicans, and the rest Blacks, Asians, Whites.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They controlled them in terms of there being more of them? Or they ran it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More of them, and they ran it too. They control the money, they control everything. The drugs, everything. I stopped dealing with drugs when I was in jail.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s the difference between a skinhead and a Nazi? I thought they were the same.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. They have different relationships... Skinheads don&#39;t like nobody. Don&#39;t like Jewish, don&#39;t like Mexicans, they don&#39;t like Blacks. They&#39;re just White. And the skinheads, they&#39;re still racist, but I mean, they share with other races too. I&#39;m not really into... I don&#39;t know. I never-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get into fights with them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No. We actually kept it cool. It all depends on if they like you. I&#39;ve heard at Pelican Bay, they have trouble with peckerwoods, Mexicans and peckerwoods. There was a huge thing going on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these skinheads and Nazis, and bikers and stuff, they were controlled by you guys?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For once.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, for once. And in soccer, for once. That&#39;s the only good thing. Yeah. But I mean, you see, Mexicans are too emotional. Too </span><span class="c1 c7">intuitivo</span><span class="c0">?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intuitive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, intuitive. </span><span class="c1 c7">En Mexicano es as&iacute;, no</span><span class="c0">? Americans are, they&#39;re more rationalized. They think, you know? More logic. Mexicans, [&ldquo;ehhh,&rdquo; feigns uncertainty]. It could be good, it could be bad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the guards? Were the guards Mexican?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of them were Mexican-Americans.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did they prefer the Mexicans over the-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they were Americanized. They did their job. I never had a bad experience. I had a bad experience with Whites, with guards. They discriminated some. Not with me, but some of the Mexicans, migrants, they ... You know, because at that point, like, man, what are you doing in my country? I would probably do the same thing, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always, I had a lot of American friends, like Republicans. At first I was more like a Democrat. But since my religious beliefs, they were more towards Republicans, something about being empathy is putting yourself in someone else&#39;s shoes, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I know. I know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time, this guy told me, &quot;Imagine you&#39;re in Mexico, and you&#39;re very wealthy and all that. Then when we come to your country, and then you see us downtown shaking our flags, our American ... How would you feel? You&#39;re in your country, and we don&#39;t want to learn your language. And we&#39;re taking advantage of welfare, social security. How would you feel? Would you like it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you say?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. In my beliefs, I did it wrong. But I believe Mexicans should legalize, learn the language, learn the culture, adapt because you&#39;re coming into my house. You know? I do believe that. You could be </span><span class="c1 c7">patri&oacute;tico</span><span class="c0">, you could be-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patriotic?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, patriotic. But you need to respect somebody else&#39;s house. I believe there&#39;s a lot of good Mexicans trying to live the American dream. There&#39;s a lot. But there&#39;s also a lot of Mexicans that are in the jail systems.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you could send a message to the US president today ... ?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I would do it, I would check people&#39;s background. They&#39;re really good at that in the States, you know? You commit one little thing and it will show up for the rest of your life. And if people aren&#39;t going to college, if people aren&#39;t migrants contributing to the American economy, they shouldn&#39;t give them the opportunity. But with people that are destroying the community with drugs and all of that, I deserved what was given to me. I deserved it. Something about succeeding is you got to recognize your failure. Failure is not your last option. It&#39;s not where it stops. When you fail and you recognize and are responsible, then you have a good chance to succeed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So part of this project that I&#39;m doing is to try to address some of the anti-immigrant feeling in the United States, to try and take people&#39;s stories and experiences away from Fox News, and where people get their information from the President&#39;s Twitter feed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. CNN, and-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to try to provide information, so people can understand better who Mexicans and Central Americans are, and to humanize migrants.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What message should I take to them? How do I help change attitudes? What do I say to them? I want to go on the road. I want to go to Arkansas. I want to go to-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treat your neighbor as you want to be treated. That&#39;s my only words. And me as a Christian, don&#39;t forget about God.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think there&#39;s a way, this is something I ask you as a Christian because I&#39;m not a Christian.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewish?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sort of. I&#39;m nothing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay. Okay. But more your culture?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, my family is.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I can&#39;t understand is how some evangelical Christians can support such inhuman policies like we&#39;re seeing right now. How is that possible? Explain this to me as a Christian. How can we support separating kids from parents? How can we support such cruel things? I mean, I&#39;m not even asking how we can support a president who does all this stuff, but how can we support? Like, why? So how can I talk to them? I mean, what do I say to them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what? I don&#39;t believe politics are the answer to our problems. It has to go through politicians, but it has to do more with peoples&#39; conscience, and principles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do I reach their conscience? How do I go to, sort of, I don&#39;t know, somewhere in Texas or Arkansas or somewhere, and I try and talk to people? Which is what I want to do. I&#39;m going to talk to very conservative, evangelical Christians. How do I make them think differently about migrants? What message can I give those people, to help me as a Christian understand? Because it&#39;s foreign to me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. For me, to me, I believe if you have empathy with people, and put aside your political beliefs, it could help a lot. Because I don&#39;t believe politics or even religious itself will solve the problem, you know? I would talk to those evangelicals to remember Jesus. He was a migrant, as well. The Israelites were migrants, and they were treated as slaves, as well. God does not want that. We&#39;re all equal. Just because we look brown, and we&#39;re probably more na&iuml;ve ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do also believe that Mexicans that migrate over there, they should respect and learn. And the people that do want that, it will make the better country. America is a great country, because they had a vision, and they welcomed. It happened to the Irish. It happened to the Chinese, to the Italians. For some reason, the African-Americans and the Hispanics, not just Mexicans, right now we&#39;re in the process. But we need to humanize.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. That&#39;s what I want to do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to humanize the people. It&#39;s like, tell those evangelicals, when Jesus healed on the Saturday, it&#39;s the law. You&#39;re breaking the law. It&#39;s about being merciful, about doing the right thing, you know? That&#39;s my message to them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop with that. Thank you. Thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much. I feel so honored to have met you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re welcome.</span></p><div><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
