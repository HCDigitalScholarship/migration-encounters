Just some background questions for gender I can assume, man, it&#39;s okay? And then your age?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34 years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34.

I was little, so I&#39;m guessing for a better living. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You can say economic reasons. Did you have any family in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or one option is family, reunite the family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you asking me if I have family there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, for this one? Sorry. I think&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s what I&#39;m asking. I&#39;m not sure&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no I can explain that. So this one&#39;s like, why did you migrate to United States? And then there&#39;s a couple options, like economic reasons, violence, discrimination, reunite family, or other. Was it just economic reasons?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, economic. I&#39;m guessing, I mean, I was young, so I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s the reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we can skip that. And then, so how old were you when you migrated?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then so how did your family enter the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you, or in this case, your parents, apply for political asylum?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got, they got, uhm&hellip; My mom&#39;s a resident now or a citizenship. She&#39;s a citizen now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. But upon entering, did they apply for citizenship?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I think they just came here illegally and then somehow down the line she fixed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you become a U.S. resident?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to, but my situation didn&#39;t work out. But I was already at my social security.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were close.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was real close.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were two so you didn&#39;t have any English language skills when you went to the U.S. Did you learn English while you were in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then how did you learn English? Was it at courses at work and in the community?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School. And then how would you describe your English language skills now? Is it good, fluent? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they&#39;re good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talk really fast and you can understand me. Then that&#39;s kind of the bond. Do you need a napkin or anything?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m good. I got coffee on the floor. [inaudible 00:02:17].</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what cities did you live in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived in ____ Illinois. That&#39;s where I really lived all my time I was out there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you go to school in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. For senior year, I didn&#39;t. Nah, I didn&rsquo;t. I just, I dropped out my senior year. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so we&rsquo;ll say, like&hellip; would you say midway through senior year?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, midway. I was almost made it through high school, dropped out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can get more into the details, like what that&rsquo;s all about, in the interview. And then, did you work in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how many years?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I work?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was like 16, 17, til I got deported.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how old were you when you were deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like 8 years?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, around there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then could you list the jobs you had?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a bunch. I mean, I worked at a restaurant and I&#39;ve been a cook, I&#39;ve been a cashier, I worked in demolition, I worked in remodeling, painting, landscaping work, I mean, name it. Everything that a immigrant does out there, I&#39;ve done it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking, restaurant, cashier, painting, landscape, remodeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I miss one?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that&rsquo;s it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair amount. Do you remember your most recent job, how much you earned per an hour?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was, I was making, or I was paying, how could I put this here? It all depend on what type of work we&#39;re doing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On commission?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was doing remodeling, uhm, I was getting paid by the rooms that I did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We worked hotel rooms. So depending on how many rooms I got done, I got paid. I got paid 150 for each hotel room that I did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, we&#39;ll say a hundred and fifty per room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold on, I&#39;m sorry. It was 250. I&#39;m sorry.

So in the beginning, you were with your parents?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well yeah, when I was younger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&#39;ll say parents but then also later alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have any siblings?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother and sister.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother and sister. And during the time in the US, were you frightened of U.S. authorities?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I was frightened? No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you or your parents send money to relatives in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know what they did. I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t send nobody nothing. I mean, I didn&#39;t know nobody.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did you live in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was 2 years old, I got deported when I was 24. So 22 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. During this time, did you follow any U.S. political news? Like on TV or social media?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not really. I didn&#39;t really know I was illegal till I was like 13 years old, 12 years old. My mom said we need to go get on your fingerprints taken so you can get your social security so you could work. I said, &quot;why do I need that?&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re not a citizen.&quot; I said, &quot;What the fuck is it?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I thought I was born here.&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re not born here.&quot; I said, &quot;All right then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know what it meant to not be undocumented?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really at the time, I didn&#39;t. I mean, knew that you just weren&#39;t born there. I didn&#39;t know that down the line, all that was going to happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything, really everything went bad for us as gang-bangers or whatever, when that 9/11 shit happened. Ever since everything for us, just&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone&#39;s like post 9/11.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since then everything&#39;s just, that&rsquo;s, it is what it is, you know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you were in the U.S., did you follow Mexican political news?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no I wasn&#39;t really into none of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you apply for, DACA, like Dreamers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not that I know of. I mean, I don&#39;t know what my mom was doing that she was the one that was able to get me the working permit. And then I had a soci&hellip;. they give you a social and things like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, so you said you didn&rsquo;t qualify for DACA. You didn&#39;t apply because you did not know about it or not enough time to [inaudible 00:07:10]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was back in 2008 so that didn&#39;t even exist at that time, I believe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can say it wasn&#39;t that. So you were too old at that point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because this program just started a couple of years ago, right? That DACA, whatever?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was pretty recent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so, I&#39;ve mean. I had been gone for a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just put that in, real quick. And then, uhm, what caused you to leave the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deported.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you detained when you were deported or were you given voluntary deportation?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detained and deported.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then could you tell me in one word what prompted your run in with ICE? So there is detained by the police, imprisonment, workplace or other way, wrong place at the wrong time, or other?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess other, they ran up in my house. They didn&rsquo;t, I mean, it&#39;s not that I was in prison, why they went and picked me, nah, they just, they said my name popped up and they went and they had all a search warrant, or not a search warrant, a arrest warrant. And they went to my house. They, they&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it for?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if I would&#39;ve known at that time, everything that I know now, I&#39;m pretty sure I would&#39;ve beat the case. I&#39;m pretty sure I would&#39;ve been able to stay because knowing what I know now and what was my situation back at that time, I was like 95, maybe like 80% that I would have stayed. But due to the fact that I had a couple of my other boys, you know, went through the same shit, I&#39;m sorry, through the same situation. And I didn&#39;t, I didn&rsquo;t want to go through it, I didn&#39;t want to go sit in jail, wait for eight months and then for them to tell me &ldquo;you know what, you still got to go back.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. First, by police and then ICE.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I just signed. I said, you know what, as soon as ICE grabbed me, I just signed my deportation and that was it. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did the authorities that came to your house, was that police or ICE?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was both? Was that for traffic violation, relation to gangs, or? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just, they were just there to grab me, that&rsquo;s it, ICE was there to grab me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you don&rsquo;t know why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they used the police as for me to open the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When were you arrested by the police, what was that for?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, were you were arrested by the police at any point before that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Before that, I mean, I had cases before, when I was younger, you know. I had like a couple assaults, a couple burglaries. I had like four burglaries, couple of assaults, things like that. It&rsquo;s just that you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.

And then for detention deportation, did you appear before a judge?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because I signed my deportation right away. I didn&#39;t want to, I didn&rsquo;t want to see nobody, because I&#39;m telling you I didn&#39;t want to wait in jail and see nobody. I had my twins that were like two years old, and so I didn&#39;t want to, have them waiting or anything. So I just signed. I&#39;m not going to sit in jail just for them to tell me to go back. You know? I said, I just signed it. So I didn&#39;t see no judge, I didn&#39;t see nobody. They just signed my deportation, that was it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you were informed of your rights?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well yeah, they told me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just what they say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have a lawyer helping you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn&#39;t want it to. I didn&#39;t want my family to spend no money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then ever since you were detained, how long were you detained for?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I got deported, the first time? They deported me like a month and a half. A week and a half later. It was fast.

Yeah, no, they didn&#39;t let me go, they deported me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And do you remember where it was that you were detained?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? Where I did prison time or?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can do first for the week and a half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in, uhm, in this little county called McHenry County.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you spell that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McHenry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, McHenry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, McHenry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, for the two years and a half where was that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in, first they had me in, uhm, all over the place at that time.

We can just say prison moved around Illinois to Oklahoma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was in two different places in Illinois. And then from there, after a year later, they sent me to finish my last year in Oklahoma City.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then were you greeted by any authorities, representatives of any organizations on reentry to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just some people in the border?
