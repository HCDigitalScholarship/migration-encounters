And so you said you don&#39;t want to talk about Mexico, so...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll talk about it. I&#39;ll put it out there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let&#39;s start with, maybe, is it more fun to talk about the States? Can we start by talking about the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could start from the beginning, like how I got there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was only seven years old. 1998. My parents went first, in 1997. It was my mom and dad, they went there first. Wilmington, Delaware. That&#39;s where they got to live first. And then they sent one of my uncles to come get me and my little brother around 1999. Yeah. And I was seven years old when they took us over there across the border. And we was living in San Francisco, California for like two months. And then from there they took us to Wilmington, Delaware.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Delaware. Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, Delaware, the first state.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was that compared to California?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To California? It was pretty different. We had to go there because our parents was there, but I really liked California when I first got there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t like California?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you did like it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But my parents wanted us to go to Delaware, so they took us to Delaware. And that&#39;s where I grew up most of my life, in Delaware. That&#39;s where I got all my friends, I know everybody. I went to school. Love Delaware.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they want to go to Delaware? Did you have family?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s where they lived, my parents lived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c9">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s where they lived, my mom and dad. And that&#39;s where they was currently living at, and in 2003 they got separated. They</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;kind of like </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;got split up. Relationship wasn&#39;t working anymore, so they separated. So my dad... I had a little sister that my dad had over there, she was three years old. She was born in Delaware. So when they got split up, my dad, he took my little sister and my brother, my younger brother that went with me to the States. He took them down here. He brung them back over here in 2003. So he left me with my mom by myself out there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just you and your mom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Then my mom got with somebody else, with another guy, and she started going out with him. She had a baby. She was pregnant. She had my little brother Angel, and then she was pregnant with my little sister Theresa. So she wasn&#39;t really paying no attention to my anymore, she was doing her, her life with him. And he didn&#39;t really like me like that, so I was out there. I&#39;m going to say I grew up in the bad neighborhood at the time. There was a lot of... We got the Blacks and we got the Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, and then they got the Mexicans, whatever. But I stayed with my kind because they was... It was a must back then, there was a lot of gangs and stuff around the neighborhood. And going to school, getting bullied, and stuff like that. It was rough at the beginning, and then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say you stayed with your kind, do you mean with Mexicans?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mexicans, like Hispanics. Sometimes there was a couple Puerto Ricans that were cool with us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you hang out with Dominicans?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c9">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. Only Puerto Ricans. They didn&#39;t really like us, I don&#39;t know why. And there was a lot of gang stuff, I had that problem growing up. So I had to stick around a certain crew to be </span><span class="c5">alright</span><span class="c0">, you know? I only did that when I was young, but then I grew up, like age 18, the teachers started finding out that I was having problems at home, that my dad wasn&#39;t with my mom no more and that I was being in the streets too much. So they started finding out when I started going into juvenile hall. So they started to know that I was having issues, and they called the state on my mom and they knew that I was staying somewhere else, that I wasn&#39;t staying with my mom. I was underage. So they took over me and they put me in the foster home up in Dover. Dover, Delaware. They put me in a foster home there with a African-American dude. He was pretty cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What led you to go to juvie?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being with the friends, stealing and stuff like that. Doing stupid stuff when you&#39;re a kid, 14, 15 years old. Stupid stuff. So it was just like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was this ever part of a gang, or just...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a like a part of the group, something like that. But as soon that I got turned 18 years old I kind of changed my life around. I tried to change. All my tattoos, I did them when I was a young kid. I was a teenager. So after that I didn&#39;t get no more tattoos. And after the age of 18 I finished, when I was in juvie, I did like a year or something. I was in ninth grade when they got me. I did tenth and eleventh in there. So when I got out they was going to put me back in school, my probation officer, because I was still in state custody. So I was going to go back to school, but then I started working. They gave me night schools. I couldn&#39;t go to normal school no more. They gave me night school and stuff to go and get my diploma and stuff like that, or-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you were working during the day?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Or my GED. But then I just got a normal job. A job that I had to work every day. So I just stopped going to school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you didn&#39;t have time to finish it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I thought it wasn&#39;t going to help me at the time or nothing, like the school wasn&rsquo;t going to help me, so I&#39;m just going to start working. So I started working, and I was working for a while. Started landscaping, I started doing construction work, like foundations, how you start a house and they do the foundation, like the under. Like the basement, stuff like that. So I was doing that for a minute. And then I got with this girl, she&#39;s citizen. I got with this girl and we got together, and then we got in a relationship. And then we got married our fourth year together, we got married. We&#39;re still married right now. She could help me out, but she&#39;s been a really... She don&#39;t want to help me out at all. She&#39;s like a...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re still married.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we still married.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still... Do you still consider yourself married? Or are you separated?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We separated, but we stayed married. We never got divorced. I got with somebody else and I was still married. I told my partner, I was like, &quot;Look, I&#39;m married with somebody, she don&#39;t want to give me the divorce. I already talked to her, she blocked me on Facebook and everything, I don&#39;t know what to do and I don&#39;t want to...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you don&#39;t talk to each other?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we don&#39;t talk to each other at all. So that&#39;s good news because right now she, a week ago she called me talking about, &quot;Look, I got a lawyer, the divorce is ready to go,&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m happy about that.&quot; You know what? Because I can marry my fiancee that I&#39;m with right now, because I got twins with her. I got twin baby girls with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No in...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, in Miami.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because then from Delaware I moved to Ohio for a year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in Ohio?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akron. Akron, Ohio.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. I was born in Dayton.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah? Yeah, Akron, Ohio&#39;s, I think, what? An hour away from Cleveland, I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was there living in Ohio because a friend was like, &quot;Come down here, man. I got you with a job and you&#39;re going to get good money.&quot; I was getting good money. I was getting like 180 dollars a day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was getting about 900 a week and stuff like that. So I went over there to work, but the job was heavy. It was concrete work and it was tough, but it was worth it. So I was out there working, I was doing good. I was doing fine. And I was with this girl, that one I had married. I was with her for five years. So she went with me. We had our own apartment. I used to work, come home. Work, come home, that was it, and be with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the one that&#39;s the mother...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is the...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one. The first one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the first one I married, we got married. And she was from Chicago originally. She was from Chicago, Illinois. So she was like, &quot;Do you want to go?&quot; She wanted to go to visit her dad and her family because she hadn&#39;t seen them for a minute. She was like, &quot;You want to go to Illinois? I&#39;ll take you with me and we can go out there.&quot; I was like, &quot;I really don&#39;t want to go, I want to stay in Ohio because I&#39;m doing good here, I&#39;m working, we got an apartment, we&#39;re paying...&quot; We used to pay 450 for rent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s pretty cheap in Ohio. The rent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And with the good job, you were making good money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a good job, I was making good money, so I was good. I&#39;m like, &quot;You know what? Let&#39;s just stay here.&quot; Because I wanted to make my own business, like a little restaurant, you know. A little stand somewhere selling Mexican food and stuff. That&#39;s what I still want to do. That&#39;s been my goal since back then, and I still want to get back to the States and do the same thing like that. And I&#39;m learning how to make a lot of Mexican food out here, so I&#39;m...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn while you&#39;re here and then take it back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&#39;m going to take that out... Yeah, because some of the food that they got out here is not out there, and I seen that when I was out there in the restaurant. So It&#39;s not the same food like they got out here. And I came out here and I seen more food that I&#39;d never seen, and I tried it, and I&#39;m like, &quot;It&#39;s pretty good.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;They don&#39;t got this out there. If I take this out there it&#39;s going to blow up. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what kind of food would you want to have at your restaurant?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexican food. Also authentic food. Kind of Americanize it, too, but have the real Mexican food, too. Have both so that I have all types of customers. I&#39;ve got that in my head since a long time ago, but now...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where would you want this restaurant to be?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m still thinking about that, because Miami... If I fix my legal status I would like for it to be in Miami. Miami, Florida. Because out there there&#39;s no businesses like that, many places that got restaurants and stuff like that. So that&#39;s where I want it to be, but since... I&#39;m going to see what happens later on in the future, but I really do want to do that still. I&#39;m still young. I&#39;m 27 years old, and hopefully I&#39;ll get through that all my 30s and come back and have something, have a house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let&#39;s go back a little bit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you tell me a little bit about the story of how you ended up leaving?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Then from... I&#39;m going to tell you the whole thing, so...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from Ohio I went to Illinois with her. She convinced me, we went out there to Illinois. I met her dad, her family, and I worked in the restaurant out there, too, for a little bit. And then we got separated. That&#39;s when we got separated, and we broke up, and it was like, you know what? Been five years, we always fighting, this is not... Let&#39;s take a break. It was just going to be a break, you know? I was like, &quot;Look, I&#39;m going to go back to Delaware, and you stay over here. We&#39;ll take a break and we&#39;ll see what&#39;s up later on.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so I went back to Delaware, and since all my friends are there and I grew up there, I went to school there. So I seen everybody and I started working. I was doing good. I had my car, I had my apartment, I was doing great by myself. And I really didn&#39;t need nobody because I always had my own back working. My mom, she lived in Miami, Florida at the time. She moved to Miami, Florida in 2008. So she took my little brothers with her. She always had her own independent life with the man that she got with. And me, I had made my own life up there. I grew up a little more up. I was 18 years old. I just worked by myself and tried to be independent. And I used to go visit my mom every once in a while, two months, and then go back up there to Delaware and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I decided to go out there around Hurricane Irma. I don&#39;t know if you had heard about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when it went through Florida, I told my mom, &quot;Look, you can come down here during the hurricane, because I don&#39;t want nothing to happen to you. I heard it&#39;s going to be really bad. I don&#39;t want nothing to happen to you. Can you please come down here?&quot; I begged her to come down here. So then she went to Delaware and she stayed out there for a week. She grabbed a rental car because she fixed her residence already, so she&#39;s a resident now. But she can&#39;t help me out until she&#39;s a citizen. So...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so she-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long has she been a resident?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently. She just recently...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just got it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like two years, probably. Yeah, because I wasn&#39;t even in Miami for two years until they busted me. When she went down there for Hurricane Irma, I didn&#39;t want her to go back driving by herself. She was like, &quot;Can you go with me so you can help me drive?&quot; I was just going to help her drive because I had a girlfriend in Delaware. I had my car, had my apartment. And one of my friends used to stay with me, so we used to split up the rent together, so it was good. And my mom told me, &quot;You can come, if you want to help me drive down there you can stay in the house for a month and then you can come back,&quot; and I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I helped her drive all the way down there, and then I stayed in Miami, and then I seen some of my old friends that I seen when I used to go visit her. So I kind of stayed. They got me a job and I was like, I stayed with my mom. She needed help because at the time she had broken up with her partner, too, and she left him, too. And she had a problem, she used to go to work and she used to sell food. So she left the kids alone one time at the house, and somebody told on her and they took the kids from her. The state. And they didn&#39;t want to give them back. I used to go to court with her and see if she was going to get them back. They took full custody of them, the state, Florida state took custody of them. So she wasn&#39;t able to get them back, ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never got them back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That must have been really hard on her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. She stayed by herself, so I decided to stay in Miami with her and help her out. We had an apartment together and I just helped my mom, because that&#39;s my mom. So I told my boy, &quot;You know what? I&#39;m going to leave my car, you can stay with the apartment, though,&quot; and I was like, &quot;If later on somebody wants to buy the car, just let me know and just send me the money.&quot; And he did. Somebody bought it for 700 dollars. So it was a Mitsubishi Eclipse, it wasn&#39;t that new. It was an old car, but it was pretty nice. So I sold that one and then I stayed in Miami with my mom. I worked in drywall. I used to install drywall, that was what I liked to do the most because... So I had a car accident out there. We had a car accident in 2011, I think it was. Had a car accident in December. It was Christmas time. We got out the road, it was icy. We was going to New Jersey, to a party out there, and the car got out of control, it slid, we hit a pole, and then we started flipping.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was everybody okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody was okay. It was five of us. One of my friends, he flew out the car and he landed under the car when it stopped. And then we thought he was dead. We thought he lost his life. I was scared, like, &quot;Oh, what are we going to do?&quot; &quot;Well, let&#39;s take him out.&quot; And then my friends, we lifted the car from the back part, because he was in the back part of the tire. And we lifted it from the back and one of my friends pulled him, and he was knocked out. At first we thought he was gone, and we was scared, like, &quot;What are we going to do?&quot; But some guy came running from all the way from his porch. I think he was from the military or something, because he told us, &quot;I seen that from all the way to my porch. I thought it was a family or something, so I ran over here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was like, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you all survived that because it was a pretty ugly crash.&quot; He was like, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all all right.&quot; And he was the one that called all the ambulances and paramedics and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like you guys got lucky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone being...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did. And from there, that&#39;s why I got messed up for my back a little bit. And here I was working construction and I messed my leg up. That&#39;s why I&#39;m messed up right now. Well...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So were you able to keep working after that? After your injury?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told me that I couldn&#39;t lift no more than 80, 50 pounds. But I didn&#39;t listen. I was young and I was like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to keep working because I got to make money.&quot; And I kept working, working, then one time I messed up my back, and I was like, &quot;Oh, man.&quot; So they told me it was because I lift too much heavy stuff, and I didn&#39;t pay attention to that. Well, then, when I lived in Miami, I got with my second, my fiancee that I got right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one you&#39;re still with now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I got with her. I already knew her since the first time I went to visit my mom in 2011 and to Miami. I already knew this girl, but she was with somebody else. But we was friends all the time. And we kept talking, and when I went back that time with my mom to Miami, we started going out a lot. We got together. Then she was living by herself and she had three kids, and you know what? None of the baby daddies was taking care of her. She was like, &quot;I don&#39;t need them,&quot; and this and that. And I was like, &quot;You know what? I&#39;m trying to be with you.&quot; And she wanted to be with me. And then we got together, and then I took care of her. And I used to work and she used to take care of me. Whatever, you know. Work together. I love that girl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we&#39;re together, we had our own apartment, and then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When were the twins born?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got her pregnant. And then I didn&#39;t find out they were twins until later on. We always used to talk about it, I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, they&#39;re going to be twins. Watch.&quot; And then we used to joke around. And then we go to the hospital, check the ultrasound, right? And they tell us it&#39;s twins. They saw two eggs. And I was like, &quot;What?&quot; I started crying. I was like, &quot;Oh.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice the baby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So she started crying because she was like, &quot;I already got three and you just gave me two.&quot; So it was kind of exciting, too. So I was really, really, really happy. I was like, &quot;Man, I&#39;m about to have my first kids and they twins,&quot; and I was really, really happy. And then from there I kept working. And one time I went to get some tools from my boy&#39;s house, it&#39;s an extension and a drywall gun. And I was waiting outside his building. I was waiting outside his building, I was on my way home. The police stopped and was like, &quot;What you doing out here?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Nothing, waiting for my boy.&quot; &quot;What you waiting on?&quot; And he got out. And I was like, &quot;I&#39;m waiting on some tools he&#39;s going to give me because he works with me and I need them tools tomorrow. We&#39;re going to work two different places, so I need them tools.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; And he was like, &quot;You got any drugs on you?&quot; I was like, &quot;Nope, you can check me. I don&#39;t got no drugs on me.&quot; And he checked me and everything, he&#39;s like, &quot;What&#39;s up with your tattoos? What, you a gang banger?&quot; And I was like, &quot;Well, look, I got my tattoos because when I was young I was into a little group, but I don&#39;t do that no more. I got my family, I work. I don&#39;t got a criminal record. You can check my criminal record. My adult record is clean. I don&#39;t got no permanent record at all. You can check that.&quot; He was like, &quot;Oh, look, well, you got brown pride, that&#39;s a Latin King. You a Latin King?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I told you I&#39;m not no gang banger. I&#39;m not affiliated, I&#39;m not nothing. I don&#39;t got no gang banger friends out here like that. I got my tattoo somewhere else, in a whole different state when I was young, ten years ago. I changed. I&#39;m not into that anymore. I got my family. I got my girl pregnant.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my ultrasound picture in my passport. And they seen that, they didn&#39;t really care. Because after that they took my information down, whatever. They told me to take my shirt off, I got more tattoos. They were like, &quot;Oh, so you were part of this and that.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I told you that&#39;s over and I don&#39;t do that. That was when I was a kid.&quot; All right. They didn&#39;t really care. So they took my information down. I gave them my correct address and everything. They let me go that night. And then two, three days, they went to the house. My fiancee had just went to pick up the kids at school. So she left. She went to pick them up, I stayed at home. And they came knocking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I opened the little blind from the window, and I seen that it was the same detectives that stopped me that day. I&#39;m like, &quot;What&#39;d I do now? Why are they here?&quot; I started asking myself, &quot;Should I open the door or not?&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to open the door, but me, I opened the door just to see what they wanted. And all right, so he was like, &quot;How you doing?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m doing pretty good. I just got out of work. I&#39;m waiting for my lady, she went for the kids to school,&quot; and that was going on. He was like, &quot;I need to ask you a couple questions. It&#39;s about a case that we got going on right now, and your name came up,&quot; which was all a lie. My name didn&#39;t come up on anywhere. He didn&#39;t have no case. He just did that because he investigated that I was Mexican and that I had no documents, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he took me, he lied to me and told me, &quot;Just go outside, I&#39;m just going to ask you a couple questions, you can come back to your house.&quot; All right. I told him, &quot;I&#39;m going to cooperate with you, I&#39;m going to go. All right?&quot; So I left, I closed the door. I left my phone inside. So when I noticed that he was going to take me is when I asked him, &quot;Can I go grab my phone? Because I need to call my lady to let her know what&#39;s going on. Can I please do that?&quot; He was like, &quot;No, you can&#39;t go nowhere.&quot; Like, &quot;But you just told me I&#39;m not going to go to jail. You told me you going to let me go, that it&#39;s just some questions, right?&quot; He was like, &quot;Oh yeah, but I got to wait for another officer to come here because he&#39;s going to ask you the questions.&quot; All right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&#39;re waiting there, I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m just going to go get my phone right quick.&quot; And when I get up and go he grabs me, cuffs me, and puts me on the floor. So I, &quot;I thought you said I&#39;m not going to jail.&quot; All right. So he took me, and then he took me to the Miami police department, and then immigration came there and they was like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m ICE. I&#39;m part of Homeland Security.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did ICE treat you compared to the police officers? Better, worse?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c9">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess they just followed their process. They was just like, you know, &quot;I&#39;m ICE, you don&#39;t got no documents.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Look, man, I didn&#39;t come here to crime. You can check my criminal records. Totally clean. No felonies at all. I don&#39;t got no felonies, I didn&#39;t commit a crime to get here, can you please let me go. I got two baby girls on the way right now, my girl is pregnant with twins. I got three kids I take care of. I pay the rent. She&#39;s not working. She can&#39;t work because she got a low risk. She could have lose the babies because they were twins.</span><span class="c5">&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Man, after that I was really mad. I started crying. They took me in. They put a hold on me on ICE. I fought my case for five months because I really wanted to stay. I went to school there. All my life was there. I didn&#39;t really want to come to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were detained for five months while...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My case, they was working my case. So I applied for asylum because they denied everything on the book for me. They denied everything, like cancellation and all that. They denied everything. All I could go up for was asylum because... I was like, I&#39;m going to go for asylum because I am really afraid to come to Mexico. I had two friends down here that somebody took their life here. Both of my friends were in the States, grew up with me. They got deported, and they lost their life out here. So I didn&#39;t want to come out here because I don&#39;t want to go through the same thing, which I&#39;ve been through some things down here that...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your friends got killed here in Mexico after being deported.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How were they killed?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got shot. And there&#39;s a lot of crime out here. So one of them was for no reason. Because the other one, I don&#39;t know, I guess he was involved in some type of a... I guess, you know, it&#39;s hard to survive out here. It&#39;s hard to get a job. He was living out there in them states that are really rough with the cartels and stuff like that. So I guess he was getting into that because I guess he needed money. And he lost his life because of that, I guess. But he got shot 10 times. So after I started finding out a couple friends of mine lost their life out here, I really didn&#39;t want to come to Mexico. I was like, I&#39;ve lived down here my whole life. I&#39;m going to fight my case because of my baby girls. They need me. I&#39;m not going to leave them by theirselves. And whatever. I fought my case. They denied everything. I went to the last court for the asylum and they was like, &quot;The only way we can give you asylum it was for something political or something religious.&quot; I&#39;m like, No way. Nobody&#39;s going to get asylum for something political in Mexico. I&#39;m telling you the reasons why I don&#39;t want to go to Mexico, and you&#39;re still going to send me down here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c9">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They make it very, very hard</span><span class="c5">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they make it really hard for somebody. And I&#39;m like, &quot;Look, I got my baby girls on the way.&quot; My fiancee was there in the courtroom with the belly and everything, and like, &quot;Look, can I get a chance at least, or something?&quot; But they couldn&#39;t. They just said, &quot;No. If you want to appeal it...&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;How long is it for appealing it?&quot; It was six more months, probably. Five or six months. My fiancee was like, &quot;Appealing it? Well, the baby&#39;s getting here,&quot; and this and that. I&#39;m like, &quot;Well, you&#39;re not the one, first of all, you&#39;re not the one that&#39;s in here, locked up, eating this crap. My mom got to put 200, 100 dollars every week, every two weeks for me to eat right. All right? Look. I&#39;m not going to stay in here. I&#39;d rather be free. We can fight this outside,&quot; since the judge said she was going to give me voluntary departure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told her, &quot;You know what? Let&#39;s take that. I&#39;m going to take the voluntary departure, and then let me fight this outside, because I don&#39;t want to be here anymore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you decided you would rather be back in Mexico than in detention.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really didn&#39;t, but I didn&#39;t want to be in detention, either, because the police is there, and the COs were pretty racist. And I had a lot of problems there, they-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did they do that was racist?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just, one of them told me he was racist. He told me straight to my face. I was like, &quot;You know what? You got something against me? You got something against us?&quot; &quot;Yes, I don&#39;t like some of you, and I don&#39;t like some of the Haitians, either.&quot; Because he was Haitian. I was like, &quot;You got something against me?&quot; He was like, &quot;Yeah, I do. I do. I don&#39;t like you all. And I don&#39;t like some of the Haitians, either.&quot; Because I told him, &quot;You always take their side,&quot; because it was because of them that I got in trouble. We got into a little conflict because they tried to gang up on me, whatever, because there wasn&#39;t that many Mexicans in that holding cell, whatever. And I got in-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was this in Florida?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that was in Florida. And they locked me up. They pepper sprayed me for no reason, and all because I told them that they moved me to another cell block. And when they moved me they broke my stuff. All my commissary was gone, all my shampoos and stuff that I was buying, a couple of my clothes. And somebody threw a cup of water on my bed, on my little mattress that they give us. And I&#39;m like, &quot;You all not going to do nothing about this? Look what they did to my stuff. All of my stuff is missing, can I please get it back.&quot; I&#39;m like... They didn&#39;t do nothing. They didn&#39;t really care. So they threw me in the hole, whatever you want to call it. In the holding cell by myself. They put me in confinement. But before that he just pepper sprayed me for no reason and just took me there, and they was pretty-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long were you in confinement?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For like two weeks. For no reason. I didn&#39;t even do nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s rough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And then after that they kept being rough with me after. They put me back on the cell block. They was really... I don&#39;t want to say bad words, but they were really mean to me, you know? They were assholes to me. And I didn&#39;t want to be there anymore. I would get in a fight because there, people are so, for no reason... If it&#39;s not him, it&#39;s him, and it&#39;s him. Somebody always looking for something. And I just don&#39;t want to be there anymore, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how long ago was this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was before November. When I was in custody.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like nine months ago?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Like eight months. Eight, nine months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight months?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so they had me in there. I fought my case. And at the end they just give me voluntary departure, like I was saying. I told my lady, &quot;You know what? I&#39;m just going to take it and we&#39;ll see what we do. And they give me voluntary departure, you can go to Mexico and marry me. Let me just get the divorce with my first girl,&quot; because I was still married. And when I came down here I tried talking to her, the first girl that I married. I was like, &quot;Look, I know me and you are not together anymore, that we had our ups and downs and then we split up, but we&#39;re still married. We had a long time together, five years, can you help me out? You know I got my baby girls on the way, just help me out, like get back. You&#39;re the only one that can ask for the I-130. We&#39;re still married-&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she&#39;s a citizen and you were still married.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, she&#39;s a citizen. Yes. And we&#39;re still married. So she could do it. And for that we had to get back together or whatever. I was going to do it because I still loved the girl. We both messed up and stuff, but I really felt something for her. Well, my baby mama, the one that was pregnant, she got with somebody while I was locked up, but not because she wanted to. She even told me, she started crying when she told me, when I found out and she told me. She was like, &quot;Look, I didn&#39;t do it because I don&#39;t love you. I love you to death. But I did it because I&#39;m by myself. I can&#39;t work because of low risk.&quot; She could have lose the babies. She lost the apartment. She had to go live with her mom. But then she still needed help because she couldn&#39;t work. So she got back with the first guy that she was with, the father from the kids that she... He got with her because I guess she told him that she was going to go to a shelter, and if she wanted him to see his babies in the shelter, then I guess he was like, &quot;I&#39;ll help you out, then, until he gets out or whatever.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just helping her out. They wasn&#39;t having no relationships or nothing like that. That&#39;s what she told me. So...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so are you still, are you together with her now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk and all that because of the girls. She sends me pictures and stuff. She lets me know how they&#39;re doing and all that. And she&#39;s still with the guy. And she&#39;s like, &quot;Whenever you get back, you already know that I love you and I don&#39;t want to be with him, he can go his own separate way.&quot; And she&#39;s about to get her own place and that. She&#39;s not going to be with him anymore. She&#39;s-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so if you come back she&#39;ll be with you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah, that&#39;s what she&#39;s saying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she come here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re thinking about that. Now that my ex -wife told me that she got the divorce going on now, so she&#39;s like, &quot;Look, I&#39;m going to get the divorce going on for you because I feel bad for you and your girls,&quot; whatever. I&#39;m like, Wow, well you didn&#39;t feel bad when I first got here, right? Now six months later you&#39;re going to tell me this when I already been through hell. You&#39;re going to tell me this. It&#39;s all right though, I appreciate it. Thank you. And I will talk to the lawyers so we can get this going, that way I can...So my lady right now, my fiancee right now, telling her, Get your passport and get the girls the passport, that way you can come see me with the girls and we can get married. Then we can start the process, whatever. But we need money. We don&#39;t really got the money right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been able to meet the twins?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. She&#39;s thinking about getting her passport so she can send them to me, since my sister is a citizen and she was born over there, and my two little sisters. They&#39;re both thinking of bringing them down here to me so I can meet them and see them. I&#39;ll be pretty happy to see them when they come. But I&#39;m still looking at that. I&#39;ve been depressed a lot out here by myself. I don&#39;t got nobody out here. The family that I...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family that I...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any family here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family that I got here from my mom&#39;s side and my dad&#39;s side, I don&#39;t know any of them because I left when I was a kid. I really have no type of connection with them. So nobody tries to help me out, tries to help me out. Nobody. Nobody at all. Nobody. So I don&#39;t really talk to them. The only person that received me was my grandma, and that&#39;s because I looked for her. She didn&#39;t know I was here. So I looked for my grandma, and I went to see her. And I talked to her. She seen me for the first time, she got pretty happy. We both started crying. &quot;I missed you, I always wanted to come down and see you but my legal status, I was trying to fix it. I got married but this girl wasn&#39;t trying to start the process. She thought I only got married with her because of the get the papers or whatever, residence. But no, I got married because I really loved the girl. She knew the problems that I had in my life and that I wanted to come see my family and stuff like that, but...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she live in Mexico City, your grandma?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandma? She lives in Mexico City. So I went to see her and I talked to her. &quot;Look, grandma, look, this happened. They sent me back and I don&#39;t got nowhere to stay.&quot; I stayed in the streets here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how long?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For like a month, almost. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hell. It wasn&#39;t because I wanted to. I was looking for a job, but I couldn&#39;t find a job anywhere. I had to get my papers, like my birth certificate. You know, they ask for a whole bunch of papers out here. It&#39;s crazy. Not even in the States. All you need out there is your ID and your social. That&#39;s it. But out here they ask for like a thousand papers. And it&#39;s hard for me to get all that. So then after I got all that, I started getting myself together. I started working. The reason, when I got off the streets, one of my friends told me my first month here, I was going into my second month, it was Christmas time. And I told him on Facebook, I told him, &quot;Look, I&#39;m in Mexico. I know you&#39;re here too,&quot; because he has gotten deported, years ago, though. He was like, &quot;Oh, why didn&#39;t you tell me when you first got here? You know I got you. What&#39;s good? I can help you out, where you at?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, &quot;Look, I&#39;m in Mexico City, but I don&#39;t got nowhere to stay right now, can you help me out?&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, sure. I already told you. You can come out here.&quot; And he lives in Toluca, Mexico. So he&#39;s like, &quot;Come out here. You need money and stuff?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I got enough money to get the bus. Where you at?&quot; So we met up and he let me stay at his house. He had a whole room for me. I had my own room. He got me a job at a restaurant. So I was good, I was doing good. I was eating. I was at the restaurant, I had somewhere to stay. I was happy for life. I started... But I was still unhappy because I was by myself, I didn&#39;t have no family that had my back. I missed my girls. They were already born around them times, so I wanted to be there. December, they were born.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s been the hardest part about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To survive. It&#39;s the money don&#39;t last down here. What you get paid out here ain&#39;t the same that you get out there. I still don&#39;t adapt myself to getting what I used to get out there, like I used to make. Now I appreciate everything I had out there. I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, I never sent no money out here when my grandma used to tell me, &#39;Send money out here so we can build you a house, build you a...&#39;&quot; She got a big territory, how you say it, she got a... Her, how you say it? Her property is pretty big. And half of it is not even built. She only got the front side built. The whole back side is empty. And she always told me to send money so she can build up in the back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I came down here to Mexico and seen it with my own eyes I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, I should have listened to my grandma. I would have had my own spot so when this time they sent me, I would have had a place to stay with her in the back.&quot; But I stayed with her, but she got me a room in her place with my dad. And now I think about it. That&#39;s my motivation if I ever do make it back legally, since I don&#39;t got a criminal record and I didn&#39;t commit a crime to get... I got voluntary departure. And if my fiancee comes down here and marries me and she helps me go back legally, I don&#39;t care if it takes a year or two. But as long as I get to be with my baby girls and be with her and be happy and start a business like I told you, I still want to do that restaurant stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I&#39;m going to start with something small, but I want a restaurant later on, like something big. Something like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s what you&#39;re really hoping for right now, is to...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s my goal. Right now-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get back there. Open a business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I had it hard in Mexico. Then from there, when I was with my friend out there, I lost the job out there, for the restaurant, only because I missed a day. They didn&#39;t want to give me a chance, I don&#39;t know why. They discriminated. I&#39;m like, you know what? Whatever. So then I told them-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of that, I just want to make sure you&#39;re not late to work. Keep an eye on time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Yeah, then here it&#39;s the same thing. You missed a couple days they want to let you go. But I came back to Mexico City, and that&#39;s when I got a hold of my grandma. That&#39;s when I started living with her. But I was still looking for a job. Then I started working in a construction site as same thing, like a rebar helper. And it was rough out there in the sun. And then I messed up my leg, and then I wasn&#39;t working for like a month and a half. And I kept looking for jobs and I couldn&#39;t find a job anywhere. And then people started mentioning, like, &quot;Well, you speak English. You can get a good job out here, like call centers and all that.&quot; They would always tell me that. I&#39;m like, &quot;Nah. I don&#39;t know where the call centers are.&quot; I tried applying AT&amp;T, and I went to the interview and everything. I passed my English test, I passed everything, the interview I went with the guy. He told me he was going to let me know. And then he just emailed me talking about I couldn&#39;t get the job, that I should try next time for another position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was like... I guess it was the experience, because everything need experience for... Having customer experience to get the job. So I didn&#39;t get the job. So I was pretty upset because a couple friends worked there that also got deported, and they worked there and they&#39;re doing pretty good. They live right there in Torreo. They liv right close to the building of AT&amp;T. They were like, &quot;If you get the job you can come stay out with us out here in the apartment. Can rent you an apartment upstairs and you&#39;d have the job right there.&quot; So I was happy that if I would have got the job I would have the apartment and I would have been really close. So I was pretty disappointed when I didn&#39;t get that job and I just gave up. I stopped looking for job. I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, look, I tried going places with English, and...&quot; I&#39;m like, you know what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my cousins, he used to live in California, he came to Mexico, too, and he speaks great English. And he worked in TTEC, and he told me, &quot;Look, I worked in TTEC, you should go apply there.&quot; So I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, I don&#39;t lose nothing. You know what? Nobody&#39;s giving me no type of income.&quot; My mom used to send me money here and there, and my fiancee too, but they stopped because when I used to live... When I was with my grandma, I was around the bad area. And I guess wrong place, wrong time. This happened because they went there, the police went to get some guys that were there selling drugs. And I guess they ran away. They ran away. And because I seen people running, what&#39;s going on? And I guess the police, and one of them, one of the detectives came to me. He was dressed normal. He just had the badge. He was like, &quot;Look, I&#39;m a detective. Are you with them?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I don&#39;t even know them. What you talking about.&quot; Like, &quot;Yes you are. You hustle with them. We&#39;ve seen you out here a couple times.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I don&#39;t know them. I don&#39;t know their name, I don&#39;t know who they are.&quot; They said, &quot;We&#39;re going to take you with us because you don&#39;t want to tell us nothing.&quot; So they took me with them and they planted drugs on me illegally. And they just planted like 40 caps of cocaine on me. And I didn&#39;t have...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So police here in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the police here in Mexico. Yep. The corruption that they be doing down here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think they chose you to do that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don&#39;t know. I really don&#39;t know. That&#39;s why I try not talking to many people and tell them that, &quot;Look, I got deported. I&#39;m from the States,&quot; because they think you got money and they trying to get you. You know, they trying to plot on you. And they trying to get money out of you. So I don&#39;t tell nobody no more that I come from the States. I&#39;ll be like, &quot;Oh, I lived in another part of Mexico.&quot; They hear my Spanish. My Spanish is totally different than the Spanish they speak out here. So they notice right away, they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re not from out here. Oh, you&#39;re not from around here. Where you from?&quot; They start asking questions. So I try not talking to many people or associate with nobody because they&#39;re just looking for a way to get paid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you think that&#39;s why you were targeted, because you seem like you&#39;re from somewhere else?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they probably notice. Yeah, they notice my accent, that I&#39;m not from here, so I guess they thought I had money. And my stupid ass told them the truth. &quot;Look, I got deported, can you give me a chance? I just got deported like six months ago, I don&#39;t know nobody. I don&#39;t know them guys that you wanted to catch, but look, can you please let me go?&quot; And they was like, &quot;Nah, you&#39;re going to tell us something.&quot; And they took me with them and they planted drugs on me. Because I didn&#39;t have no drugs on me at all. And then, after they let me go... I was in the penitentiary here in Mexico for like five days. I didn&#39;t know who to call. I didn&#39;t know my grandma&#39;s phone number. I didn&#39;t know nobody&#39;s phone number from my head. They had taken my cell phone. And when I got out they never gave it back. They kept it. So I had an iPhone, so I think that&#39;s why they kept it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I called my mom, that was the only number I had. So I called my mom, I was like, &quot;Mom, look, they got me in here.&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t understand, you keep doing bad things. You in Mexico.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;I didn&#39;t even do nothing. They just got me and they put drugs on me. They corrupted out here. You already know they corrupted out here.&quot; And she was like, &quot;Well, I told you they like that. I told you to stay off the streets.&quot; &quot;I wasn&#39;t even doing nothing. I was by the store about to get something and then I sat down just a little bit, and that happened. Wrong place wrong time type stuff. And then they got me and they put me in here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was like, &quot;Oh, well, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m going to get you out of there, all right?&quot; So she got a lawyer, she paid him 1500 dollars, which is 2500, 3000 pesos here. So that&#39;s a lot of money. And that&#39;s the reason why they don&#39;t send me a dime anymore, because look, if I ask for something, like, &quot;Mom, help me out. I&#39;m already going through it right now. I don&#39;t get paid until this date. I need some right now.&quot; And she&#39;s like, &quot;Nah.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;Nah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s already given a lot of money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. She&#39;s like, &quot;Nah. I just paid for you to get out. You&#39;re going to have to look for your own money now.&quot; Like, &quot;But mom,&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, I was about to go back but this happened.&quot; And the lawyer got me with a, it&#39;s called a suspensi&oacute;n condicional. I don&#39;t know how to say that in Spanish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional suspension?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional suspension. Yeah, she got me out with that. I got to sign one time a month for six months at the city. I got to go sign to make sure...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like probation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like probation type stuff. So I got to go sign one time a month, and I&#39;m just going to go do my second signature this 14th. So I was going to go back illegally. Honestly, I was going, because I miss my... I want to be with my girls and I don&#39;t want to miss out on anything else. So I really was going to go back illegally. I already had my person that was going to take me and everything. I already had everything for this month and I was supposed to be gone right now. I was supposed to be in Dallas right now. This happened, now I can&#39;t go nowhere because if I miss one signature I have a warrant here for my arrest in Mexico. So anytime if I would get back to Mexico, they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, you tried to get away and you missed a signature, you&#39;re going in. And you&#39;re going to do the three years without seeing a judge.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s the only reason why I&#39;m still here. And I think this helped me out because it helps me think more like doing things legally. I told my fiancee, &quot;You know what? Let&#39;s do it legally while I got to wait six months. Go get your passport. I&#39;m going to get the divorce. Go get the passport, get the baby girls the passport, come see me, let&#39;s get married. Let&#39;s get the lawyer and let&#39;s start this. Let&#39;s start this now so in a year I got my residence and...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you want to do it legally this time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is she, your fiancee, is she a US citizen or resident?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. She was born in Miami.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. She&#39;s a citizen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so I told her, &quot;Look, this had happened to me. I didn&#39;t do nothing.&quot; Everybody thinks I was out there hustling because I&#39;m in Mexico and I need money, so they think I was out here hustling. So I told her, &quot;No, I wasn&#39;t doing nothing. It wasn&#39;t me. They put them drugs on me.&quot; So that&#39;s what they put me down on the court. That&#39;s the crime they put down. Possession of drugs and he was hustling, he was of commercial, whatever. So that&#39;s what they put me down on. And the lawyer got me with that. So right now, it&#39;s why I look for a job now. You know what? I&#39;m really going to have to look for a job. Nobody&#39;s helping me out anymore. I&#39;ve got to do this, because I&#39;m not going to starve out here. So I went and I was going to go back to Toluca, my friend out there, and see if I could get the restaurant job again. But then I came to the call center when my cousin told me. I came to the call center, they did the English evaluation, they got me right away. They gave me the date for the interview.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how long have you been working there now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A month now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, congratulations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From six months of being here. I&#39;ve been doing good and I&#39;m happy because it&#39;s a great job and I really like my job, and everybody there is cool with me in the group. So...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, and I want to start wrapping up to make sure you get back to TTEC on time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, all right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my last question for you, I know you&#39;ve talked about a lot of the bad things about coming back to Mexico. To end on a positive note, is there anything that&#39;s been a good thing or a positive thing about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess just seeing my grandma and I guess just getting this job has been the only thing that&#39;s been positive. The rest, I thought... I don&#39;t even cry no more because I already cried a lot. I already cried a lot. I don&#39;t even... (crying)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t do it no more, because for what? Because you got to be strong, you know? You got to stay strong and do this. And hopefully this is going to be a big lesson for me, though, because now I got to see what Mexico is like, and all my life that I&#39;ve been out there. So next time I got out there legally I&#39;m really going to do something out here. I want to make like a three-story building. I want to have a business out here for my brothers that don&#39;t have... That grew up out here. Because I got an older sister and older brother that grew up out here. And they&#39;re used to this life out here, but I still want to help them out if I ever go back. Have a couple businesses and have them in charge or whatever. I want to do something better next time I go back there. I want to do something for my future, like for when I grow up and I get older, because I know we all get old, you know? So I want to make it to an old man or whatever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I&#39;m like 40 years old I already want to have my houses out here. So next time I come back out here I got my places, or my daughters want to come down here I got get them a place, too, so they can stay and come see Mexico, whatever. So that&#39;s what I want to do. That&#39;s my goal. I always wanted to have that restaurant out there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, get that restaurant opened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Antonio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m going to make it. I&#39;m going to do it. I&#39;m going to do it.
