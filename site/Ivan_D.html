This is Lizzy, I&#39;m interviewing Ivan. Let&#39;s start with ... How old were you when you came to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was actually a baby. Uh, 10 months old. I believe it was when my uncle took me over there. Cute little baby, actually. I might add. Yeah, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were very young.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very young. I don&#39;t have any, like, recollection of my, you know, of my baby days until I was like two or three or something, but ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you came with your uncle?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. See, my mom gave birth to me and they decided to just, you know, take off to the US to chase the American Dream. My uncle, as the months went by after my parents left, he&#39;d seen that I was starting to be not a normal baby. I was just always looking for my mom, or you know, or my dad. And the aunts and uncles ... Hugs weren&#39;t doing it for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he was just like, &quot;Man, I got to get this guy over there.&quot; And took it upon himself to, you know, pretty much take that whole little journey, because ... And he tells me to this day, he&#39;s like, &quot;Man. Believe me, it was a real journey. You crybaby.&quot; Ah, you know, he tells me all kinds of stuff. But, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you guys walk across the border?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did it through ... He tells me we did it through San Ysidro, Tijuana. Baja California to the beach. And he tells me the story, he&#39;s climbing up the poles right there in San Ysidro. Me on his shoulder or what-not. And he&#39;s, boom. He puts me on the little thing and then he&#39;s like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Bien </span><span class="c1 c3">unas gabachas, unas gringas alli.</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; </span><span>[There are some white ladies over there]</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span><span>Oh my god, baby, baby!&rdquo; </span><span class="c2">You know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I guess he handed me off to the ... Yeah, to the American folks. And I guess we just played it off like he was with them until the driver or the Coyote showed up. And we bounced. Yeah, it was that easy back then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s quite an experience to go through as a baby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think it was more of an experience for my uncle having to deal with. He didn&#39;t even have no kids back then. So just imagine, changing diapers not even knowing how to do it. He clowns on me on that, you know, but it&#39;s all good. I love my uncle. He&#39;s like ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still close with him?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Actually, he is the one ... He&#39;s one of my uncles that does have his citizenship now. And, uh, well, he comes over here often. And he tells me ... The first time he saw me here, he was like, &quot;You know, your dad&#39;s not here. He&#39;s over there. And now I&#39;m your dad, and you know that.&quot; And, you know, he tries to get at me like my dad. But he&#39;s real cool, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you grew up in the US for your whole childhood?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole childhood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile. Childhood, juvenile. Elementary, middle school. One year of high school, because I got kicked out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile hall. Juvenile camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we get to that stuff, you know, getting kicked out of high school ... Do you have a favorite memory of your childhood in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do, actually. And I think this is how I ... I&#39;m not going to say my Spanish is, like, perfect, because my punctuation is bad. You know, like Really bad. Apostrophes, acentos, and all of that? No. Uh-uh (negative). Let&#39;s just go back to basic old English. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ... See, when we were young, my dad&#39;s Christian and my mom&#39;s Catholic. So I used to go to both churches. Christian during the weekdays, Bible study and all that. And then, like on Sundays, my mom would take us out to a </span><span class="c1 c3">misa</span><span class="c2">. And I think some of the most, like, peaceful ... Or I don&#39;t know. It was just like, it was just real calm. And my dad would make us all read the Bible, but we&#39;ll ... I&#39;ll read a whole thing and then I&#39;ll pass it to him, and then he&#39;ll read it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, my brother would read it. My sister was too young. But we&#39;d just keep going like that, and I don&#39;t know. I found it ... If I could just, like, paint you a picture, it&#39;ll be us four, because my mom&#39;s Catholic, like sitting in my parent&#39;s bedroom. My dad laying down, my sister over there, you know, and my and my brother on the rug or whatever. With the window open, nice cool little breeze, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just reading the Bible, you know with the thin pages trying to flip by themselves because of the wind, you know. And real chill, real cool, real peaceful, like, you know. That type of thing, man. And playing with my brother, man, and my little sister. Those were also pretty good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it sounds like a lot of happy family memories as a child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My parents, they did a good job, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then ... Once you got to, like, your teenage years, you mentioned juvenile hall?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ... Where did that all start?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Females.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Females?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. No, I&#39;m not lying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Tell me more about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was all Gucci in elementary, you know, and then everybody started going through puberty. You know, uh, middle school. Getting into fights over females, uh, you know. Yeah, man. And at the same time ... We used to live in a 32-unit apartment complex and my parents were actually the managers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh, so, we&#39;d have the kids from the apartment complex come over, and since we&#39;re the managers, my dad had a good job. He was actually a truck driver already. Well, we had the Super Nintendo. We had the Nintendo 64 and shit like that. And, like, all the kids from the apartment complex would actually go over there, you know, like my little friends and what-not, would go over there and play with us or what-not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a ... My homie, or one of my homies that I grew up with as a little kid too, in childhood ... Found out that same apartment complex, he had an older brother that&rsquo;s, uh ... Well, back in those days was a member of a street gang. Which, since I was 14, I started representing. And we was about eight when his mom, actually, she received the news that, you know, that they had killed him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they killed him?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They killed my friend&#39;s older brother, you know. And, well, we had to go through the whole</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">velorio</span><span>&nbsp;[wake]</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;through my friend&#39;s parents. You know, their sorrow and all that. And then, it kinda like started making me hate black people. Anything that wasn&#39;t Mexican, really. Long Beach is a really, really racial city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What city?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Beach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Beach, California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, do you feel comfortable saying which gang it was?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, man. Well, actually ... Yeah, no. I think we should leave it like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. That&#39;s fine. That&#39;s fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can see I actually have it tattooed on here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay, you don&#39;t have to say it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah&hellip;no. It&#39;s all right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That led to your friend dying?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, you started ... That changed how you felt about black people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About black people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Because of that and ... You know, we were the minority in my middle school. Not the minority. We were kind of, like, equal. Actually, the white people were starting to get to be the minority.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were just like always bumping heads, because we&#39;re better than you all, and woo-woo. It was just like ... And with the thing that happened with my friend, it was like, fuck these ... And we just started bumping heads. And then, I got recruited and got put on. It was just like ... Juvenile hall. Juvenile camp. You know, things like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What led you to be in juvenile hall?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, that&#39;s the crazy part. When I was 14, my dad and my mom found out I was smoking weed. And I&#39;m being really honest right here, you know? And so&hellip; And I remember I tripped out early too, when I said 420. I was down there, and it was 422 on the little entrance. I put 420. And a coworker is like, &quot;No, it&#39;s 422.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;But I want it to be 420.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it actually has a meaning to me, like 4/20 day. You know, I go out and I&#39;m chilling with my friends from my neighborhood. I wasn&#39;t from the neighborhood yet, you know. But I was already chilling with them and we would start banging the neighborhood, but, you know, wasn&#39;t really from it. So, I&#39;m out there smoking weed, you know. Celebrating 4/20. Worldwide anniversary for weed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, uh, I get home and I get through thinking everything&#39;s fine and dandy. I get home, I open the fridge. I remember mom had left me a plate of, um, chicken enchiladas ... But I used to tell my mom ... My mom used to make them like that, because I love them like that. Like capped with Monterey cheese. And, you know, just ... I seen them. I was like, yes. And put it in my microwave, let them melt, and then went back to my room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother was already knocked out. I turn the TV on and I&#39;m watching Cops. Bad boy or whatever. And, um, I crash out. About an hour, or a few hours later ... Or a couple of hours later, the flashlight wakes me up. Low pace. Low pace. &quot;Get up. You&#39;re under arrest.&quot; Say, what, you know? They were like, no, man. For real. You better get up before we get you up. Under arrest for what? Assault and battery. What?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, man. Don&#39;t act dumb. Your mom told us that you got here all drugged up. That you snatched the phone off the wall and you threw it at her. I said, really? So, if I did that, where is the phone at? No, no, no. You&#39;re not going to start with that BS, woo woo. We&#39;ll get your ass up. They got me up, handcuffed me, and I went to juvenile hall for three months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were how old?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 14.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing how ... Seeing my mom, now, or, you know, uh, going through therapy or what-not. She said that she did it because she found out I was smoking weed and she didn&#39;t know any other way to help me. Uh, so that was that. But, see ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she thought that calling cops would be the best way to get you help?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think about that? Do you think she was right or not?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because I actually lived it. </span><span class="c1">Yo se la viv&iacute;</span><span>&nbsp;[I lived it].</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You know, I had to go into this juvenile hall. And it&#39;s not cool when you&#39;re labeled as the kid that beats up on his mom. You know&hellip; So, I caught the blues. I caught the blues. But, I mean ... That just kind of fed my anger towards African Americans or what-not, because juvenile hall where I was at, they&hellip; they were like the big ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might be tall, but them motherfuckers is like ... They do a couple of push-ups and they&#39;re like, woo. Not us. Yeah, man. They pretty much put them people on me. And I just, like I said, it fed my thirst of hatred towards them. And I get out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m wondering ... So you mentioned how some of this led to you getting involved in gang stuff when you were young. Why do you think that so many young Mexican guys in the US end up turning to gangs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say it&#39;s the lack of a role model or a father figure, mother figure. You know, something that&#39;s real. You know, not a cartoon, not something you see on TV. Something that is real, you know, to look up to. And obviously, if you&#39;re a little kid and, you know, you see mofos go by on trucks, you know, or you got the chains on, bald-headed. You&#39;re like, man, I want to be like that guy. You know, like who&rsquo;s that? You know&hellip;I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That becomes your role model?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that pretty much becomes our role model.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your relationship like with your dad?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was bad. Yeah. See, I started like ... Yeah, man. Like the whole, rebel, or rebellion thing at that age. Like eighth grade. You know, uh, middle school. That&#39;s when I started to, like, misbehave. They actually shot me to a program called, Devil Pups. The United States Marine Corps, they have a, you know, special ops team called, the Marine Corps Devil Dogs. They&#39;re based out of Camp Pendleton in San Diego.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since my dad always used to go to on-campus suspension in middle school, and since the on-campus suspension dude was from the Navy, he pretty much talked my dad into saying that I needed some discipline. So, they shot me over there to that program. It was cool, though. I loved it. I still got my picture there. I got my ribbons, you know. I got to shoot a 50-cal when I was real young.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s probably exciting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Laying down and my whole ... This right here was like ... After I got off it, yeah. But it was really cool, like&hellip; I got to ... What I thought was the most challenging was jumping off a 50-foot tower into a pool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was pretty scary, you know, because I looked down and ... I was the first one up. Not the first one, the third one up to the tower. But I was second from last to jump down. I didn&#39;t know I was scared of heights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you had all that time to get nervous. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Get nervous and jump. And them motivating me. Not really motivating me, just Marine Corps drill sergeant [yelling noises]. And you&#39;re just like, oh my god. I&#39;m just going to jump. Fuck it. You jump.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, man. I forgot where we were at with that, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, talking about this military ... What was it? Like a camp?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah. It was a camp. It was camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camp. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was a camp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like that changed you in one way or another? Being at that military camp?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It did actually. It taught me about, you know, chain of command. Learning how to follow orders in order to give orders. Um, yeah, man. That&#39;s what it taught me, man. Discipline. So, uh, I kind of enjoyed that. And all this started going on, and then ... you know, I get busted. Juvenile hall or whatever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get out, and then it was just more of a reason for me to be like, what&#39;s up man? I want to get put on. We&#39;ve been out here, man. We from the hood. You can&#39;t say we ain&#39;t from the hood. Like, shit. And yeah, man. Pretty much got put on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, let&#39;s talk a little bit more about what led to you leaving the US and coming back to Mexico. What happened there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2006, I turned 18. But in 2005, I had did a ... It was an armed robbery. Me and two of my homeboys, we go up in a store and it was already because ... The dude from the store was a Salvadorian dude. And I don&#39;t know why Salvadorian people don&#39;t like us in the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&#39;s because of the whole process that they have to go through in order to get to the States. They got to go through Mexico. And I guess Mexican people, on their little way, they treat them bad. So, when they get over there they have a little resentment or what-not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there&#39;s tension between Salvadorians and Mexicans in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least where you lived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty much. Yes. So, we get a call. One of my homeboys, well actually my older homie that did that with me. He gets a call and he&#39;s like, look. And he turns around, tells us. Hey, fool. Look. There&#39;s this Salvadorian nigga, you know, thinks he&#39;s the shit, you know. Refusing to sell, you know even if they&#39;re trying to pay him things too and, like, </span><span>[inaudible]</span><span class="c2">. Just because he feels he&#39;s the shit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we got to go, </span><span class="c1">para darle el culo</span><span>&nbsp;[get his ass]. </span><span class="c2">I don&#39;t know how you say it. Pretty much, like, you know, we got to go tell that nigga, what&#39;s up? And it was like, in the meantime, we&#39;re going to rob him. Let&#39;s go. So, we went. And yeah, pretty much jumped over the counter and started beating. Pistol-whipping him with a gauge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that was in 2005, when I was 17. I still go to camp for six months. Juvenile camp for a grand theft auto. I get out in December 2nd of 2005. January 21st, 2006, I turn 18. February, they busted me for th</span><span>at</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;armed robbery that I did about a year ago, in 2005.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they dropped it down to a 212, because my homeboy, the oldest one ... He was 27 at the time? Mm-hmm (affirmative), 27. He already had an armed robbery with a strike on his profile. So, being that he was the oldest one and the cameras seen him with the strap, they charged him for a second armed robbery, uh, with another strike. And they gave him 22, for the gun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22 years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And me and my homeboy were 18. First-offenders as adults, you know. And they dropped it down to a strong-arm&hellip; And gave me three years, and they gave him two and something. Two-and-a-half. And a strike. I got a strike. Yeah. And I did those three years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State prison, Delano. Centinela. Uh&hellip; that was pretty much it. Delano and Centinela. And then, I get out, 2009. I get deported through TJ. I was only out for like four days, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. You had just gotten out of three years in prison. And then, what happened? ICE showed up at your house? Or how did that happen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I got deported. I got deported, because back in &#39;98 when I was 10 years old, my parents tried to get their citizenship, right? And because my mom is not too good at lying, and because she got nervous when she was giving her little testimony, the judge pretty much said, &ldquo;Nah, man, I could tell you&#39;re lying. Come on, man, you know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said, refused. A voluntary deportation. You guys have got three months to get out of here. But&hellip; all we did was change addresses, or change homes, and just stood there. We were going to school. Changed schools and then pretty much ... Left it at that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, when immigration comes picking me up from state prison, they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, Ivan Lopez. Okay. So uhm, yeah, you&#39;re getting deported.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Why?&quot; They&#39;re like, &ldquo;because you&#39;re from Mexico.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I&#39;ve been here all my life.&rdquo; If you ask me, I was born in Long Beach Memorial Hospital. But I knew it wasn&#39;t true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ve been here since you were like, what? 10 months old you said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kind of left it at that. They said, &quot;You&#39;re&hellip; you&rsquo;re gone.&quot; I get deported through San Ysidro.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re you expecting that at all? On any level? To be deported?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I wasn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you see it coming at all?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. If you asked me when I was 17, bro, you&#39;re going to get deported and you&#39;re never going to come back to the States? I would have looked at you like you were crazy. Why, homie? Why are you going to send me to Mexico? What? Hell, no, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have did that. So, it was a shocker, but I didn&#39;t have time to, like, dwell on it. 2009. I got out with no money. They left me out on a paper jumpsuit. Flat-jacks on my feet, you know. I get out, and before I get out, there&#39;s these </span><span class="c1 c3">paisas</span><span>, you know? A</span><span class="c3">nd they&#39;re like, </span><span class="c1 c3">no t</span><span class="c1">e aguites, cholo</span><span>&nbsp;[don&rsquo;t worry about it]. </span><span class="c2">Don&#39;t hurt ... Not hurt yourself, but don&#39;t beat yourself up because you got no money. Don&#39;t beat yourself, don&#39;t trip man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">When we get out of that bus, man, just try to stick with us and we got you.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;And they did, man. For like five days. I was the one doing the errands. Go get me drugs. Go get me food. Go get me beer. Go get me females. I was the one doing ... So, I didn&#39;t have no time to dwell on the whole, &quot;Oh my god, I&#39;m in Mexico.&quot; Like, you know, it was just really fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kept you busy running their errands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And getting high. Uh, so, on the fifth day ... On the fourth day, actually, one of those </span><span class="c1 c3">paisas</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">is like, &quot;Look, fool. About a month ago, I got deported.&quot; And I was like, &quot;What?&quot; And he was like, &ldquo;yeah, fool. About a month and a half ago, I got busted for a DUI. They reported me, and then I went back. I was out there for three weeks and they got me again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they deported me. And now I&#39;m here with you. He&#39;s like, &ldquo;I got the same Coyote, I got the same everything. I just don&#39;t want to go alone, because it&#39;s a long ass walk. We cross through Sonora, in Sasabe, to go to Tucson. Or Phoenix. But we&#39;re in TJ.&rdquo; So, he&#39;s like, &ldquo;but we&#39;re going to get the bus. And if you go with me, my baby mama is going to take care of you and the whole Coyote.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at him like, what? He&#39;s like, yeah. I said, hold up. Give me your female&#39;s number. I&#39;m going to have my brother ... I only lived with my brother for 18 months. So, my brother gets in touch with his wife. And his wife&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, man, you know, I just don&#39;t want him to go by himself. Last time he came through there, knees and hands were all scratched up.&quot; It&#39;s kind of dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my brother&#39;s like, no, don&#39;t trip. If you&#39;re going to pay for everything, he&#39;ll go. And yeah. Pretty much, we went down to Altar, Sonora. We were there for like two days. And we did the whole little crossing, man. We walked four, five days. Scratched up. Drinking old cow something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old cow something?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was just like ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like milk from a cow?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like water but it had the mildew floating on it. And it was green.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still had water. I had like three bottles. Three of these bottles in my backpack of good water. But I also had a gang of empty bottles. And I&#39;d seen everybody with this desperation of being thirsty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, and I said, if you don&#39;t fill up your waters ... I thought to myself, &quot;If you don&#39;t fill up your waters, these empty bottles that you have, uh, these people are going to know that you have water.&quot; So, just go with it. And I did. I started filling up the thing and I seen them covering the whole little thing with their shirt. And I, oh&hellip; And I did the same thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drank out of that water just to play it off. That happens and then we&#39;re on ... I think the fifth day? Fifth night? And we see the little drone. So and then.. I see the little drone, or we see the little drone, and he was like, &quot;Run. Everybody, hide.&quot; So, we hide and the drone leaves. About two minutes later, here comes the flashlights with immigration.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my mistake was, being the first one to run. You know, as soon as I see the lights, I just booked it. I ran. Everybody&#39;s reaction was, oh, let&#39;s run with him. So, immigration followed the whole little group. And everybody that was just scared out of their mind and didn&#39;t move, like shocked, they&#39;re the ones that made it. And one of them was my friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made it through, but not you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That happens and I get&hellip; I go to immigration. They&#39;re like, bro, we just let you out, woo woo. Matter of a fact, this is your ... One, two. This is your third entry to the States without proper paperwork. I&#39;m like, &quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa. What you mean, third?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s like, yeah. One in &#39;88. One in &#39;98. And one in 2009. I said, &quot;Bro, in &#39;98, I was 10 years old, like you know. And my parents were the ones doing the paperwork. I didn&#39;t know what was going on.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;I don&#39;t care. It counts as a fucking deportee.&quot; That&#39;s a deportation. 41 months for being an illegal alien coming back to our country without permission. You&#39;re going to get 41 months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41 months?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they based that off of ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost four years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-and-a-half.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-and-a-half years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they base that off of your past criminal history. You know, I had the strong-arm robbery with the strike, you know </span><span>aggravated</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;felony. And they had this little chart. How many points with how many times you&#39;re going to do. And they lined it up, and they were trying to give me 87 months. I said, &quot;What? For what? For coming back into the United States without a proper to come into ...&rdquo; I was like, &ldquo;you&#39;re crazy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I didn&#39;t even fight it. My lawyer was just like, &quot;Look, bro,&quot; on the third court date, &quot;Look, bro, these people ain&#39;t going to pay. They&#39;re not like State, where the more you wait, the lower the time you get.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. Here, in the Feds? The more you wait and you make them mad, the higher your time is going to be.&rdquo; I said, &quot;Man, how much are they giving me right now?&quot; &quot;41 months.&quot; &quot;Give them to me.&quot; I did three-and-a-half for being about two miles into the United States from Tijuana.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Yeah, you hadn&#39;t even made it that far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. It felt like it though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so, after those three and a half years ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get deported through Matamoros, Tamaulipas. And that was crazy, because I remember getting off the bus and I see the Casa del Migrantes. But they&#39;re over here like this. And you know, I&rsquo;m like, damn. They come up to us, and they&#39;re like, look, man. This is ... You&#39;re in, Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Here, you know, woo-woo runs this. And you can&#39;t speak about anybody else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you do, well, you know the consequences. And the females. They were like, the females, we respect them. You could look but you can&#39;t like [whistles] ... Or none of that. If you do, same thing happens. They loaned us a hand. We walked, or they drove us to </span><span class="c1 c3">la </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;[Spanish 00:28:11].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we pretty much got on. I went to TJ. From TJ, I see my brother. My little brother came through. And from there we grab a plane to Mexico City. And, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;ve been here ever since?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I actually went back to TJ. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long were you in TJ?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 15 months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were you doing there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was working. I was working, I had my little girl with me. I had a nice little two-floor</span><span>&hellip; it wasn&rsquo;t a big </span><span class="c3">house</span><span>, b</span><span class="c2">ut it was a nice, cool little house, you know. A little &#39;98 Honda Civic. Cars over there are real cheap, you know. Normal family thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you end up back in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ever heard that song by Shaggy? &quot;It Wasn&#39;t Me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can sing it to me, if you want?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. That. That&#39;s what happened. Like, you know, baby mama found out I was being unfaithful. And she didn&#39;t throw a fit. She just like grabbed 15, uh, 15 G&#39;s in Pesos. Everything that I have of value. And just didn&#39;t say nothing. I went to work on a Friday, came back, and the house was just a mess. I didn&#39;t hear from her for about a month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I did, she was like, motherfucker, woo-woo. Showed me all the pictures. And you&#39;re never going to see me or hear from me again. Woo-woo. And uh, yeah. Pretty much, I stayed down there in TJ for a few more months. Living the bachelor or whatever until I got tired of it, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually started, like, feeling like my little girl needed me. Like, that&#39;s that fatherly ... Sometimes, and it&#39;s going to sound weird, I could feel, like, my little baby telling me that she needs me. Like, &quot;Daddy.&quot; You know, I feel it. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just in the blood, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kind of connection?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I started feeling that. N</span><span>ah</span><span class="c2">. Bro. She needs you, fool. She&#39;s not right. And sure indeed. I come back to Mexico all bad. You know, I try to do the right thing. Home girl is just real stuck-up, because now I&#39;m chasing her to come back with me. Real stuck-up. She&#39;s taking advantage of that, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I pick up</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;[Spanish 00:30:48] and</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">mezcal</span><span>&nbsp;[alcoholic drink].</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;I was living by myself too. Here, I already come back. I was living by myself. And it was just an everyday thing for like nine months. And that&#39;s when I decided to go to a rehab center here in Mexico, called</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">anexos</span><span>&nbsp;[rehab center].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long were you in rehab?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was there the first time for like 10 months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s called,</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;es</span><span class="c1">te anexo</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;fuera de </span><span class="c1">serie</span><span>&nbsp;[rehab center]. </span><span class="c2">For hard-headed people that don&#39;t just listen with words. I was there for 10 months. And I get out, I do the whole little family thing again. And then, my baby mama finds out that I&#39;m being unfaithful again. She calls these people up and then they show. They show up to my house, find me, and they grab my ass. Throw me in a car. And another 10 months. So, yeah. I&#39;m not with her no more though [laughs].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how long has it been now since you got out of rehab?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t get out. I AWOL-ed. Both times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I escaped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You escaped. Okay. How did you do that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they finally gave me the opportunity and the trust to go pick up our food to the Ganges. This is what they do, they charge ... They make ... Well, we go out to the Ganges and we ask for food for our&hellip; for our compa&ntilde;eros.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes they give us and sometimes they don&#39;t. But yeah, they gave me an opportunity to go start doing that. So the first chance I got ... We went to </span><span class="c1">C</span><span class="c1 c3">entro d</span><span class="c1">e abasto aqu&iacute; de Iztapalapa </span><span>[food market in Iztapalapa]. </span><span class="c2">And the first ... Gone. Just disappeared. And yeah, man. That was pretty much it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was the first time in rehab? Or the second time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the first time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, the second time, how did you get out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same thing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but I, uh, kind of miss somebody in there. But that&#39;s a whole different thing. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, so how many years have you been back in Mexico now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years. What&#39;s been the hardest part about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, I don&rsquo;t know, man. I guess it&#39;s just like ... like, I&#39;m not going to say discrimination and shit. Or not being with my relatives, people I grew up with or any of that, because ... Here, it&#39;s like ... And I think that&#39;s why a lot of the homies are finding themselves in this situation that they find themselves in, because they feel like, you know, the only people that they could relate to is somebody like them, which is us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, and&hellip; and they kind of want to feel like they&rsquo;re&hellip; like they felt back when they were in the States, so they kinda like just depend on that. And, where a lot of us a</span><span>in</span><span class="c2">&#39;t doing that good, you know a lot of us are using drugs. And we&#39;re not pressured, but that has a lot to do with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry. Just a second, they need me to open the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, go ahead. Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll be right back (silence). Okay. I&#39;m so sorry for that interruption.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were saying that ... That&#39;s why people turn to&hellip; to gangs when they come back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Because they think ... I feel like they need that, uhm, yeah, that brothership, I guess, they felt back over there. And since they can&#39;t get it here, because ... Well, our cousins, aunts, you know, brothers, sisters that we used to play with aren&#39;t here. The people that we call our family here are pretty much people that we don&#39;t even know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We didn&#39;t grow up with them. And then we get here and they know that we&#39;re coming from a penitentiary. And they already stereotype us. You know, they judge us without even knowing us, you know. Automatically. Oh my god, he&#39;s all tatted. And just, off the top, you meet them and you see that reaction from them. You&#39;re like, mm no. Fuck that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You either decide to do your thing or decide to live with that until you get into a situation with one of them and you get either kicked out or whatever. But, yeah, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, people looking at you. They judge you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but that&#39;s normal. I used to be, like ... I&#39;m used to it from the States, but here, Mexico, I was like, wow. I was like, now I know what, you know, my mom and dad, you know, went through when they first got over there. You know, like, not knowing how to work. Being discriminated against, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in my scenario, it&#39;s getting here and having to work, you know, construction and not knowing a motherfucking thing. And being discriminated, you know, by our own people. Like, I feel like, man, I&#39;m going through what like everybody back in those days chasing the American Dream had to go through. I&#39;m going through the same thing they&#39;re going through, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really interesting. Yeah. It&#39;s like they went through that coming to the US, and now you have to go through it coming back here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we went through that coming back to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you consider yourself more American or Mexican?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I&#39;m Mexican. And like I said, I lived with my brother for like 18 months. Uhm, but ... See, I like boxing a lot. And we used to train. Me and my brother used to train. And my dad would always get him, like, the United States flag on his gloves. And I&#39;d always pick the Mexican ones, like, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real big fan of Julio Cesar-Chavez. All his fights, right there. Yeah, you know. I always knew I was Mexican. And for that same reason, I want to get the </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">hecho en Mexico</span><span>&rdquo; [made in Mexico] </span><span class="c2">right here. And the California State right here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You consider yourself Californian?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do. Southern Californian. Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Beach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Beach. Long Beach City, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, where most of your life was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Long Beach. I didn&#39;t really travel when I was over there. My parents wanted us, when I first got out of Juvenile Camp, they wanted us to move to Las Vegas. I said, nah, man. I&#39;m staying here in the hood. And they didn&#39;t move, because of that. You know? Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you miss the most about Long Beach?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom and dad. I ain&#39;t seen them since 2006.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, man. It&#39;s just ... I mean, I talk to my mom. And I talk to my dad. But just being like, &quot;Come here, mom, </span><span class="c1 c3">viejita</span><span class="c2">&quot; [little old lady] You know? That. And my dad, just looking at me like, my bad. My bad, fool. Doing that. I tell them over the phone, &quot;My bad. I fucked up.&quot; But not get that like Mmm ... You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The hug. The physical connection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s what I miss the most, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything good about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I love Mexico City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your favorite thing about it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite thing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, up until a few months ago, um, feeling invisible. Feeling invisible. I feel tiny. There&#39;s, like, a whole lot of people here. I&#39;m walking down the street woo-woo ... I&#39;m walking down Madero. And nobody looks at me. Not the cops. If I would have been back in Long Beach? They would have been like, &quot;Lopez. Where are the guns at? Come here.&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, it&#39;s like, I walk by them. And they be like ... I actually went to the cannabis marches that they have right here. They have little marches to legalize cannabis. And it was just awesome. A gang of fuckin</span><span>&rsquo; </span><span class="c2">potheads, and like, just walking down to ... What&#39;s it&#39;s called? Uh, man, I forgot, man. Uh, but yeah, man, we&#39;re just smoking weed. You know, I thought it was pretty cool. For real. Yeah. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you had never been deported, if you&#39;d stayed in the US, what do you think you would have done? Where do you think your life would have gone?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth, when I was 16, like I was getting the recruiters for the military. And I&#39;m talking about all military branches were getting at me when I was 15. Talking about, we can get you your papers. You know, uh, we can get you into college. And you&#39;ll come out as an officer. A second lieutenant of the army or whatever. And that was pretty much my thing. Military.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico, now. What&#39;s your plan? What do you think? What are your hopes and dreams for your life here? Or do you want to go back to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t. My hopes and dreams, man, are ... Maybe not economically, because, you know, I&#39;m in a point in time where ... That&#39;s </span><span class="c1 c3">primordial</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">[fundamental], because I have a little baby. And she eats. She likes, you know ... Well, anyways. That, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your daughter&#39;s name?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suri.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suri?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S-U-R-I.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old is she now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s five. May 13th, 2014. And yeah, I guess that&#39;s like&hellip; that&rsquo;s like, bettering myself as a person. I try not to throw trash nowadays on the floor. And I got that from my girlfriend, right now. She sees me throw out a trash, and she&#39;ll make me pick up that trash and then pick up somebody else&#39;s trash up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#39;ll be like ... The first time she said that, I was like, no you&#39;re not. I&#39;m not going to pick up somebody else&#39;s ... Crap. Fuck. All right. I&#39;ll pick it up. You know? That. Just bettering myself, man. Every day. Pretty much, man. And just being happy, man. Like, you know, forgetting about, like, all the hate. And all the, &quot;that,&quot; that I had in me for a long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just trying to ... Whenever that happens, I try to just, like, no, bro. Life&#39;s beautiful. Smoke a little stick. You know? Go out. Get some fresh air.</span><span>&nbsp;S</span><span class="c3">he&#39;ll probably trip. But </span><span>get you some</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;b</span><span>itches</span><span class="c2">. Try not to get busted by your girl, because she&#39;s going to wig out, you know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah, that. That type of ... Throw the Ray-Bans on and just be like ... You know? Yeah, yeah man. But it&#39;s cool. I love Mexico City. Man, I-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just living the good life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Trying to at least.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, man. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any ... As we start wrapping up, is there anything else that you feel like you want to say that you haven&#39;t gotten to share yet? Or anything that you want us to know about you or your experiences?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually, uhm ... And I&#39;m going to do this. You know, and I hope, you know ... I want to start </span><span class="c1 c3">un centro de autoayuda</span><span>&nbsp;[a self-help center] </span><span class="c3">for deportees. And the reason for that is, when I was in </span><span class="c1 c3">anexos</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;[t</span><span>he rehab center]</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;like I mentioned to you earlier, I express myself better in English. So, they make me go up to the little</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">tribuna</span><span>&nbsp;[platform] </span><span class="c2">and tell them my issues but in Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I felt like I couldn&#39;t express myself correctly. And then, to people that don&#39;t even know me. So, that&#39;s something that I would love to do. Like you know, open up a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">centro de autoayuda</span><span>&nbsp;[a self-help center]</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for deportees that are drug addicts. That are drug addicts, because of some type of, you know, emotional whatever. Or something that they went through in the past. And I&#39;m just letting you all know. I want to do it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I need to stop using drugs, first. Really. And that&#39;s kind of hard, actually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you&#39;ll ever go back to rehab?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to, I think. Yeah, I have to. I just hate being locked up, bro. Like just the mere thought of like having to follow a whole routine. I think that&#39;s what I hate most. Like, routines. I just like doing me. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just the thought of that is like, fuck. Crap. You know, having to follow other people&#39;s orders and you have to put up with other people. It&#39;s something that I don&#39;t do. I don&#39;t like something, I let it be known. You know, or if I feel like you coming at me some type of way, I&#39;ll let you know too. Well, you just can&#39;t do that in those places, you know, but ... Yeah, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You have to live on someone else&#39;s schedule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I think that&#39;s like normal life. Normal job. Normal everything. It&#39;s just real hard though, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not real hard. It&#39;s kind of actually simple. It&#39;s just, you know ... Stop being all hard-headed. Yeah, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your biggest goal for, let&#39;s say, this next year? What do you hope for,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">for yourself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this year coming up, my girl&#39;s going to start her second year of elementary. And I was real proud of that fact that </span><span>K</span><span class="c2">indergarten came around and I took care of my responsibilities. You know, bought her her uniforms, got her in a private school. And I walked her, her first week to her school. Even though I was working and all of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made me feel like, you know, so uh ... Just trying to ... I don&#39;t know. Not only better myself, but I got to do that. I got to take out my little girl. And I got to make sure that, you know, she shows up to her class or whatever. Her friends. Feeling herself with that confidence. Not having to go through, you know, wearing Goodwill fuckin</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;clothes or whatever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what Goodwill is?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That was ... To us, it was like, Goodwill? Fuck, yeah. Let&#39;s go shopping. Like, you know? It wasn&#39;t Target or fucking Walmart. It was Goodwill, which was cool. But I guess, some people at school were like, nigga, what? What you got on? Goodwill?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&#39;s all Gucci. I ain&#39;t tripping off of that. You know, like? Yeah, man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for your daughter, Goodwill ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my daughter, it&#39;s that. For me? Stop using drugs. This year. With the help of a </span><span class="c1">centro de ayuda</span><span class="c3">. Or not. But, see, and the reason I don&#39;t want to go to a </span><span class="c1 c3">centro de ayuda</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is because they&#39;re real back in the days about cannabis. Here in Mexico, they&#39;re still tabooed about that.
