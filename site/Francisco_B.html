This is the interview with Francisco S. Francisco, the first question I have is, why did your family leave from Mexico to the United States in the first place?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family left to the States because they thought it was a better opportunity for me growing up. That&#39;s why they left to the States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was your hometown violent at all?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my hometown wasn&#39;t violent at all. It was normal, and it&#39;s always been normal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when you first went to the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was, I would say, 8 years old when I left to the States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight years?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember my first time in the States. I do remember, because when I got out of the plane, the heat. The heat was really, really, really hot in there. It was choking me. Yeah, and everything&#39;s different. The people are different, the culture is different, everything&#39;s different. Yeah, I do remember. It was really, really hot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s one of your first good memories of the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my first good memories is when I went to school. The school over there is different. A bus goes and picks you up to your house, and then after that you get to eat breakfast. You get to play around, you get to eat again, and then they take you back home. Actually, that&#39;s one of the first good memories that I have from out there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was different from Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah, from Mexico, you&#39;ve got to go to school. There&#39;s no bus, there&#39;s no cafeteria either. Yeah, it&#39;s way, way different.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any teachers or people that you remember from school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember teachers and people from school. I don&#39;t talk to them no more, but I do remember some.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of the memories you have of them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to have this teacher in high school. He was into things, like outdoors and hiking. We actually went to the mountains to hike with him. That&#39;s why I remember him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You went to mountains to hike with the teacher?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was actually nice, because the mountains, they&#39;re not far. It&#39;s probably an hour to get up there. Then once you get up there, you can see the whole city. It was really nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did that happen, that you got to go hiking with your teacher?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to do things outside from school, and he liked to do things, so we got together and we went. It was a group. It was just me. It was just a group, and yeah, we went.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever work in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did work in the US, doing furniture.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furniture? When did you start working?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started working when I was 16 years old. I used to work when I was off school, on vacation. Then when I finished high school, I started working full-time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During your high school experience, you went to the United States on a visa.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your family overstayed it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever think about your status while going through school? Was that ever on your mind?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&#39;t in my mind when I was through school. When I finished and I wanted to get a job, that&#39;s when it started getting into my mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did it affect you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I couldn&#39;t get a job anywhere. If I wanted to get a job, I had to go do it illegally, so I didn&#39;t have as much opportunity as other people my age.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you end up getting the job at the furniture store?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad used to own it, so I started working for him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dad owned a furniture store?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like? Was he ever afraid of ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well, we were actually living right here, without pressure, without anything. The only difference is you didn&#39;t have services like regular people. Let&#39;s say if you were sick, you had to stick with it. You couldn&#39;t go to the hospital, because you didn&#39;t have insurance, but it was just normal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever feel like that was unfair?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, but we were breaking the law, so actually it wasn&#39;t. To me, I didn&#39;t care. Yeah, it wasn&#39;t unfair, because we were there illegally.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your least favorite thing about the US, or your worst memory?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My worst memory from the States is that I couldn&#39;t travel, probably. Yeah. Let&#39;s say that I wanted to go to Spain. I couldn&#39;t go, because if I left, I wouldn&#39;t be able to come back, so that was probably the worst thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did you want to travel? When was it that you wanted to travel somewhere?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been traveling all over the world. Not the world, but I did travel in the States. I know a lot of cities from there, and then I got back here in Mexico. I also know a lot of states, too. I&#39;ve been going around.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you end up back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they sent me back. It was a voluntary departure, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. That&#39;s why I&#39;m back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you were driving, and you had a ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, actually, I was at a party and I drank too much. I took off. I wasn&#39;t feeling right, so I stopped my car and fell asleep. A cop saw me, and since I had my keys in the ignition, they said I was driving, so they took me and gave me a DUI.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave you a DUI. How many days did you spend in jail?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None. Actually, probably a few hours, but then after I talked to the judge, immigration went and got me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What judge did you talk to?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked to a city judge from _____. He was giving me my charges, and he told me that he was going to let me go, that I had to go back to the court date to face my charges, but I never got to it because immigration got me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did they get you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got me when the police released me. That&#39;s when immigration got me. They just passed us through. You get released, so they release you, but since you&#39;re still in custody, immigration goes and picks you up, because they know you&#39;re illegal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like a handoff?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned you over to ICE?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative), that&#39;s correct.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what happened?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took me to the immigration center, detention center, and then I spent there nine months fighting my case, trying to stay legal. Then at the end, I didn&#39;t win, I lost, so they sent me back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine months in detention, that&#39;s a while.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I was actually trying to do it the right way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s the conditions of detention like?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s actually bad. They actually treat you like a criminal. You kinda are like a criminal. It&#39;s detention and jail, they&#39;re completely different. You can&hellip;so yeah, it&#39;s normal, I guess you can say. They don&#39;t mistreat you or anything. It&#39;s just you&#39;re locked up. Your freedom has been taken away, and that&#39;s something that you don&#39;t know how to cope with. Everything to you looks bad, but I would say it&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of things were bad in your eyes?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was bad in your eyes?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting locked up for not being there illegal. Staying there for so long, that was the hard part.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did anything happen to you that you thought was unfair, you thought was violating your rights?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that I think was unfair is the judge. He had his decision made before he even saw me, and then he made me wait so much time, not to do anything. I would rather have him be like, &quot;Hey, you know why you&#39;re not going to apply for anything? You&#39;re not going to apply for anything because you don&#39;t qualify for anything. You might as well just leave.&quot; To me, that was just the hardest part, to be there trying to do it the right way, making it the right way, just so they can tell me no, wasting so much time in there. That was the hard part.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when you got deported?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 28.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28? So before that, you had a different misdemeanor that wouldn&#39;t qualify you for DACA?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It was another DUI, so this was my second one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was your second DUI?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The other one was 10 years ago, but yeah, the judge decided the second one he&#39;d throw. The other one was-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were 18?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were under-age drinking too?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. I only pled guilty for driving under the influence. They dropped the other charges.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. What was your experience like working in the US, and just going to work, coming home?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I did like it. I used to like my job because I used to be all over the place, working out of town, going to different states, going to different buildings. It was actually good. That&#39;s why I liked it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the favorite part of the US that you visited?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The favorite one? I will have to say Florida. It was really nice. They&#39;ve got Disney World in Orlando. They&#39;ve got Disney World and then Universal Studios. It was actually nice out there. That, and then Texas, but no, it was better over there in Florida, because they&#39;ve got the beach.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been all over the place, dude. Well, [inaudible 00:11:55] New York. I&#39;ve been all over the place. I got here last May, and I&#39;ve been to a couple of states.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there ever a moment when you were in the States that you felt American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah, most of the time. You know you&#39;re not American, but you feel like one. The only difference is that you can&rsquo;t go out of the country, and that&#39;s it, and you don&#39;t get any paid benefits.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see you have a Cowboys hat on. Are you a fan?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was a fan, a Cowboys fan. Actually, I went to the stadium, which is nice, big TV.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it weird to go to the stadium and then have so many people around you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Since I was living there, since I was a little kid, I wasn&#39;t afraid, even talking Spanish, talking Spanish with the cops or anything. There&#39;s no racial profiling like they make it seem on the news. It&#39;s not like that, or maybe I&#39;ve got the luck of not having that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your return in Mexico like when you came back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was actually nice, but it&#39;s a lot different than the States, a lot different.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the way the people are, how they live, everything. It&#39;s just another world.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was transitioning over hard for you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, actually I did like it. I liked the food. I liked everything. It was actually easy. Since I was leaving there I was always speaking Spanish, so that wasn&#39;t even an issue either. It&#39;s been okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you experience any discrimination as a migrant in the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes. It&#39;s from everybody.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well, actually, you know what yeah, from the cops. They see you and they know that you&#39;re not from here, and then they go after you. I&#39;ve been working here in T Tech since probably February. What&#39;s that, four months? Just by the way that I walk, or how I look, they have pulled me over probably three or four times, just to check my back, to see I don&#39;t have any drugs or anything. Yeah, I do see that kind of discrimination here with the cops. That&#39;s it. With people, no.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever been approached or recruited by bad groups here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I haven&#39;t been approached by bad groups.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you miss anything about the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just my family, mostly, and friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they say?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back. That&#39;s what they say.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I do want to go back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would you return?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegally. I tried doing it the right way, and look what it got me. Since I was locked up for nine months, I kinda know, I kinda figured how the system works, so I&#39;m just going to try it illegally.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the system work, in your eyes?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you try to work and do it the right way, they&#39;re just going to take your time and they&#39;re going to take your money away. Now, if you just give up and do the, what&#39;s it called, the deportation, you&#39;re just there probably a week, not even two weeks. They&#39;ll say things, like you&#39;re going to stay longer there, like 10 years, five years, if you come back. When I was locked up, I saw a person go there three times, and he got deported every time. I was there fighting my case the right way, and look what happened. So yeah, I&#39;m going to try to go illegally.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what ways do you think that being in the US has shaped who you are now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the way that I am, and I also know English. That&#39;s an advantage here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel more Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t feel neither Mexican or American. I&#39;m in the middle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Cause&hellip;I&rsquo;m Mexican, but I was raised out there. Then the same thing, I was raised out there, but I&#39;m not from there, so same thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have anything else on your mind that you want to say?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No. I&#39;m okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think that governments can do better for you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably do more opportunities, pay more. Mexico is a nice country and it has everything. It&#39;s just the government is too screwed up. Supposedly they say that they&#39;re going to change it, but I haven&#39;t seen a change, not even with the new president. Probably give more opportunities for people, more programs, more things like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think things have gotten worse since Trump came into office?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in Mexico. I wouldn&#39;t know about the States, because I&#39;m not living there no more, but Mexico, I think, is just the same. It just doesn&#39;t affect as much down here. Probably on the border it does, but not here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Thank you, Francisco, for your time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Francisco:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That covers all the questions I have for you.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c6 c14"><span class="c0"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c5"><tbody><tr class="c12"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6 c13"><span class="c4"></span></p></td><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c13 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p></div></body></html>
