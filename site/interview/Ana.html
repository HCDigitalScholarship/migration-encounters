 United States?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: From what I remember or from what I know, currently, my dad went to<br>
 the States, I think he was there for about a year, and my mom decided that<br>
 she wanted us to be with him so she took us to the States.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Isabel: How did you migrate?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I, we migrated illegally. I don't remember how, but we crossed the</br> border.   </br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And you were six years old then?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And where did you live when you moved to the United States?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: We went directly to where my dad was. He was living in Brooklyn, New</br> York. So we went to live with him.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And do you remember any early memories or what was some of your</br> first experiences in the United States and even those surprised you.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I recall the school, the bilingual school, we were only there a year,</br> I have an older sister, my older sister and I. And then we were moved to</br> the elementary school where we finished our studies. I remember my</br> childhood in terms of like school and friends and such, but the first</br> memories of arriving there, I don't recall.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Can you tell me about then your childhood, both your schools and</br> your friends?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yeah. I don't remember much about my bilingual school. I just remember</br> that we were there a year, then in the other school where we finished. I</br> remember the school itself, the physical-ness of it, the weather. I</br> remember that I was a huge nerd. [Laughs]. I just focused on reading and</br> doing my schoolwork and finishing school and, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Do you have any teachers that stood out to you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yeah, my fifth-grade teacher, Mr. Ogami, really, really great in</br> teaching Math and such and books. And I remember my mom liked him also,</br> because of the program of the school, getting work done and memorizing</br> stuff. So yeah, he would definitely stand out.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's awesome. I’m wondering, did you have any classmates or</br> others who were also migrants or also had an undocumented status?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I don't think I actually know any, or I didn't make friends with any.</br> I think my parents probably knew more of those situations, my situation,</br> but on a personal level, no. In elementary, I don't remember anyone. I</br> remember that there were people from other countries like Afghanistan or</br> Bangladesh or Middle Eastern and Asians and such, but if I recall</br> correctly, all of them were American citizens.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And did you know, throughout your life, that you were undocumented</br> or did you find out about your status later?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I feel like I always knew, but I think as a kid, no one really</br> acknowledges what that is or you can't tell what people are explaining to</br> you until you get older. So I don't think I really knew until I was maybe</br> in middle school or… middle school.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Did that change your experience? Were you</br> frightened then of US authorities or the police in that sense or not.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Not really, but I think it's also because I didn't really…I wasn't one</br> to get into trouble. I wasn't one who was looking to commit a crime or</br> cause that kind of conflict or attention. I think it was a bigger deal for</br> my parents. I do remember them saying that we had to behave properly, or we</br> had to take care of how we were behaving to avoid the cops or to avoid the</br> police. But it wasn't something that I would say, I think, I would be</br> intimidated of their figure, but more on my parents’ account than my own.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. That makes sense. And a lot of people mention fear of driving</br> because if they they drive without a license, but probably weren't as much</br> in New York or...</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: No, or at least from... I don't remember how old I was, but my dad did</br> get a car. And so he would try to teach us to drive, my sisters and myself.</br> I don't recall it being an issue, trying to get a driver's license. I think</br> as I got older, I realized that it could have been a conflict, but I think</br> that he always looked into what state would be giving the driving...</br> Because I didn't know until I was older that only certain states provide</br> that. And so he would find it and he would go for it. But living in a city</br> like New York, it wasn't a necessity, having a car to move around and such,</br> it was more of what my dad wanted in life. So that's what he got.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And would you say you kept your, pretty much like academic rigor</br> through high school as you finished it, or?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I did up to high school. In high school, I felt, or I feel like I</br> started to rebel. Don't exactly remember what triggered it, but I do</br> remember that I was no longer too happy being where I was. I remember that</br> I would kind of bad talk New York or just be like, &quot;Oh, New York is ugly.&quot;</br> And then my parents decided to move on my senior year for in high school.</br> And so it just made me careless. I was just like, &quot;Okay well, I'm going to</br> move so I don't need to like work my ass off or put any effort into school</br> anymore, because we're going to go anyway, so.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Oh I see. some people mention feeling disheartened once they got to</br> high school, realizing without the proper documents, they wouldn't be able</br> to apply to college.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I feel like it hadn't reeled in on me or it wasn't something that…I</br> was aware of it, but I felt that I had so much support from friends or from</br> my own brain that I was just like, &quot;I'm going to accomplish it. Whether or</br> not it's going to be hard, I know what I want.&quot; At the time, I knew what I</br> wanted, and I was willing to just go for it. Basically, I didn't see myself</br> crashing and falling at that point. It was kind of my own carelessness of,</br> &quot;oh, we're moving, whatever,&quot; my own way, I think, of rebelling with my</br> parents that made me really careless with schoolwork for about a year. But</br> other than that, no. Despite the fact that I was painfully aware of the</br> illegal status and not being able to probably find a job, I think for me,</br> in long-term, it was the job. It wasn't even the school. It was just, one</br> way or another, you're going to be able to study. That's one of the</br> benefits of the States, right? It doesn't matter whether you're</br> undocumented or not, you're going to be able to study. Getting a job</br> though, and a job you want, that's a different story. So I think long-term,</br> for me, it was the job.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So then going from that, said your family moved, where did you move</br> to?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: North Carolina.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: North Carolina. And then how did you end up back in Mexico from</br> there?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Well, I got really sick. I got really depressed when we moved to North</br> Carolina and to this day, I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's what</br> triggered it, it's more than likely because it's the only thing I attribute</br> to my sickness. I started hemorrhaging. I started to bleed out and it got</br> to a point where it got really, really bad. I was hospitalized about four</br> times. And yeah, it just got really, really bad to a point where I just</br> didn't want to be hospitalized anymore. And so I told my parents that I</br> refused to get hospitalized and my parents said, &quot;Well, we bought you a</br> ticket to Mexico, so.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So your parents got you a ticket to Mexico so that you could</br> receive help here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yes. In Mexico, I have an uncle who's a doctor. So while I was in and</br> out of the hospital and I wasn't getting any better and I wasn't getting</br> any treatment, except blood transfusions and such, my mom sent my medical</br> records to my uncle. Don't really know what the discussion was there, I</br> just knew that she sent him my papers. And from what I know, my uncle told</br> my mom, &quot;You're either going to let her die there or you're going to send</br> her so that I can help her.&quot; So my parents were like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And they just</br> sat me down. They told me that I had to go get my passport because I was</br> coming to Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And was it difficult receiving healthcare in the States with your</br> undocumented status?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Definitely. I wouldn't say that people are harsh. I think that there's</br> a little bit of human in everyone, but it's definitely not the same when</br> you have papers. In terms of care, it's kind of... I don't know how to</br> explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure</br> that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the</br> word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my</br> mom trying to ask, “What's wrong with her? What can they do?” Doctors just</br> going, &quot;She just needs birth control. Put her on birth control and that's</br> it.&quot; Me going on birth control and nothing, not helping. And my mom just</br> kind of desperate I would say, trying to get answers, falling again in the</br> hospital, getting more blood transfusion. It was basically just base work.</br> It wasn't someone actually asking you or checking to see if everything was</br> okay, it was mostly of, &quot;What's going on with you right now?&quot; &quot;I'm bleeding</br> out.&quot; And doctors going, &quot;Are you having an abortion? Are you…&quot;—A</br> miscarriage, sorry, here it's abortion—and it was just hard at that time</br> because there was a lot of negligence also. For example, at the time I was</br> still a virgin. And despite saying that I was not pregnant at all, there</br> was no possible way, the doctors still examined me. And you know not being</br> able to do anything legal for it because you couldn't, you're illegal. You</br> can't sue the doctor for malpractice because you're not even supposed to be</br> there. So it's always a lose-lose situation. So yeah, I would not say that</br> it's comfortable being undocumented and needing healthcare.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. That's a really unique perspective. So you were able to</br> receive better healthcare then on your return to Mexico with your uncle?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I'm not sure I would say better because even so it wasn't…even here. I</br> think healthcare in general is a whole 'nother world, but it definitely</br> stopped the hemorrhages. In terms of... It wasn't a long-term fix, but it</br> did get me better health-wise.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Obviously that's a whole different set of challenges to fac. In</br> terms of just returning to Mexico and living in the US for so long, what</br> was it like just reintegrating into Mexican society?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Integrating into Mexican society at first for me was inexistent in a</br> way. To be honest, for me, my experience was just very negative. I didn't</br> want to be here. So the whole first year of my stay, one was focusing on my</br> health. That's all I basically did for a whole year. Two was basically just</br> cry every single day. And three was question when I was going to go back.</br> It wasn't a matter of “I'm going to stay in Mexico.” It wasn't until it</br> was. So, it was hard, but... And the long term or in the long run, it's</br> actually been pretty good.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: In terms of, I guess... I know this is difficult. I'm really</br> grateful that you're willing to discuss it. That's really important to</br> hear. What do you think it was like being away from your family, being in a</br> new place? Just all of those things?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I don't know. Here, I've met people who, immigrants. It's weird</br> because in New York, I don't remember anyone, but here I've met a whole</br> bunch of people and I think everyone has their own experience and I would</br> compare it to, well, maybe not compare it. It's just, I feel that the fact</br> that I didn't want to be here at first really affected the adapting into</br> the culture because, essentially, Mexico, long-term again, has been</br> wonderful. It's just, there is a lot of beauty, there's a lot of kindness,</br> if you know where to look, or even if not, but just, there is a lot of</br> good, but it took me a really long time to see it. It took me years to</br> acknowledge that I was in a place that I could enjoy being in. So the first</br> year adapting was just harsh. The second year onward after knowing, &quot;You</br> know what, if you're going to be here, you might as well do something with</br> your life,&quot; I said. That's when I started to look for a job, I started to</br> make friends, but I honestly refused to speak Spanish for the first four</br> years of being in Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: So a lot of people sometimes, for example, my Spanish has gotten much</br> better, but when I meet new people now, one of the first question tends to</br> be, &quot;How long have you been in Mexico?&quot; &quot;I've been here 10 years.&quot; And</br> they're surprised to why my Spanish is still... It's like, &quot;We can still</br> tell you have an accent.&quot; Or when I get really nervous, my Spanish tends to</br> fuck up. And they're just like, &quot;But you've been here 10 years.&quot; And it's</br> kind of like, &quot;Yeah. Speaking Spanish, I've only done it for about six</br> years.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Like been here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Right. So for me, just integrating into the culture, it's been baby</br> steps, I think. I think that's how I describe it. Just from the steps of</br> mourning, right? Acceptance, denial. Or I don't even know them in order,</br> but for a whole long time, it was just denial and then acceptance and now</br> really just flourishing into it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And mourning, mourning your life in the US or?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Mourning, I think more than anything, the loss of familiarity. I don't</br> really remember my childhood to be honest. When I grew up here, I remember</br> my grandparents and that's about it. So also adapting here in that sense,</br> was really weird. People going up to you and going, &quot;Oh, I remember when</br> you were so small.&quot; You would think that someone would appreciate that. You</br> would think that, &quot;Hey, that's cute.&quot; And for me, because of the attitude</br> that I had, for me it was just like, it was annoying. And it was like,</br> &quot;You're a stranger to me. Why are you telling me about you knowing me, you</br> don't know me.&quot; So, again, it was just really negative despite having</br> people going to me and talking to me about my parents or talking to me</br> about what they remember about my childhood. For me, it was not a welcome</br> thing. So, it was, yeah. So, it was a mourning of the loss of familiarity.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: So yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Do you think that your time in the US has shaped or it made you</br> different, giving you different skills or anything that you can use here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Well, English would definitely be a skill that I would say the US gave</br> me or the States gave me. The reality is that English is a very valued</br> asset here. I'm not sure, I think around the world, eventually, because it</br> has become the global language. So 10 years ago, when I first arrived and</br> nine years ago, when I first started looking for a job and such, that's</br> pretty much what sold me or what... I had zero prior experience minus the</br> bakery, and I didn't even mention it because it wasn't even... Really, if I</br> remember correctly, I don't know if it was just one or two weekends, but I</br> didn't like it. So I was like, &quot;I'm not doing this.&quot; And without any</br> experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always</br> tell you, &quot;we are hiring people,&quot; but it's only people with experience. So</br> all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went</br> to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was</br> horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were</br> over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the</br> supermarkets and such and people obviously wouldn't hire me. I couldn't</br> even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a</br> big no. And it wasn't until funnily enough, my mom, who was the one who</br> found out about call centers here. And she asked one of my cousins to take</br> me to one, and that's how I got my first job.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Right. Yeah. Other assets or-</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: It can even be mentality.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Skills, right?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah, anything.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: That the States has given me, I actually do feel that it has shaped me</br> in many ways to be where I am now more than the States itself though. It's</br> weird because you don't really... I feel like you don't really know how</br> much is your parent, how much is your culture, how much is your siblings?</br> So for me, English is number one. I think I really enjoy the culture that</br> they have work-wise. Work-wise, or at least, despite the fact never having</br> worked there in school and such, it's a lot of no bullshit, you're here to</br> do what you're here to do. And one of the things that for me has been</br> really hard to adapt to here is that the culture in that sense is very</br> different. Despite the fact that Mexicans are such hard workers and they</br> are, sometimes they're also very lazy. And so I appreciate having grown up</br> in a culture where you don't really beat around the bush. It's direct, it's</br> to the point and it's not about just...</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: For example, one of the things where I was discussing, previously or</br> last week with a friend, is I'm the type of person that in a restaurant, if</br> I don't get a proper service or something, I speak up. And not necessarily,</br> not talking about rudely, just I speak up when it's normally not done here.</br> People tend to accept or just sit back and let things slide by. And I don't</br> think that that's something that happens a lot in the States, or didn't,</br> not speaking about the current government, but when I grew up there, it was</br> just flu—I remember that things were fluid. And I don't know if that's also</br> because as a kid, you don't notice or know of all the issues that are going</br> on around, but yeah, I would say to summarize: English, definitely; the</br> working mentality of no beating around the bush and directness; and kind of</br> going for what you want and not being rude about it, but just trying to get</br> your point across without hurting others.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Absolutely. Yeah. I think, I didn't consider that. Just some</br> closing questions in reflection, you can answer this how you want. Do you</br> consider yourself more Mexican or American?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Oh, that's a hard, hard question. So I consider myself more Mexican or</br> American. It's funny because just yesterday, there's a fair here. I'm not</br> sure if you're aware of it. It's called feria de las culturas amigas. it's</br> in Chapultepec, which is basically, it's a fair that happens every year. A</br> lot of whole different countries come, and they expose their culture. It's</br> beautiful. Yesterday, I was there and we stopped by US, a friend of mine</br> and me. It was really funny because he mentioned to me, he was like,</br> “you're more gringa, so this is where you should be.” And I was just like,</br> &quot;Ugh, no.&quot; Basically, I don't know. I think 10 years ago, if you would've</br> asked me, I would have said American, definitely. I think six years of</br> finally accepting where I am, really adapting to, trying to adapt to where</br> I currently am, I still wouldn't say…I'm leaning more towards Mexican, but</br> I think, I'm not sure.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And then if you had stayed in the US, what would you have done or</br> like to have done?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Had I followed my life plan when I was in the States, I was accepted</br> into Peace College. I wanted to study to be a physician. So I would've gone</br> for it. I would've finished school, probably gone into med school, finished</br> my physician career and become a physician. How? Even if I didn't stay</br> there, just get the degree and work on getting myself to a position.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And then now that you're in Mexico, you've been here for 10 years,</br> starting to come in that acceptance phase, I'm sure it fluctuates. What do</br> you think some of your current dreams are for your time in Mexico? What you</br> would like to do here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: My current dreams in Mexico is, or are to actually travel. One of the</br> huge benefits of being in your own country and working, or simply just</br> actually being legal is traveling. And I hadn't realized that I really</br> enjoyed it until I had it. So one of my biggest dreams is to continue</br> traveling. I want to continue knowing Mexico and there are really, really</br> beautiful places. I want to get to know other cultures and other countries,</br> and that's one of the freedoms than being a legal alien or a citizen allows</br> you to do. And I want to continue to grow professionally. I'm fortunate</br> enough to work in a global company. So my big, big goal is actually to</br> continue growing within the company and to be sent to a different part of</br> the globe to work.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I forget what a privilege it is just to be able to take my passport</br> and go somewhere. In terms of like, we were talking about earlier, a</br> binational identity. People say that you can, migrants sometimes, [feel</br> neither] here nor there, you're either too American to be Mexican or too</br> Mexican to be American. Do you see that as a phenomenon or how would you</br> respond to that?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Definitely. I think it's a phenomenon to be too much of something, but</br> I also think it has to do with people not really maybe exploring other</br> cultures as much. One of the things that I have definitely learned in this</br> experience, and I don't think I would have known, or it wouldn't have</br> shaped me as it has, is migrating here and having to adapt to the culture</br> and to the country itself, has shown me or opened my eyes a lot in terms</br> of, you know, everyone, as an individual is just who they decide to be.</br> When you don't have that perspective, honestly, when you grow up... Putting</br> it simply, when I first got here, and I considered myself a lot more</br> American than anything, quirks about people annoyed me or not their quirks,</br> just their ways of certain expressions or it's a way of doing something.</br> For me it was just like, &quot;Ugh, that's so not what I'm used to or that's so</br> not accepted.&quot; But now it's more, I feel that I've become more flexible in</br> that sense, with people, with culture, with everything. And yeah, I don't</br> really think that you open your eyes to that until you have to live it. And</br> so I definitely think it's a phenomenon to say you're too much of</br> something, but I don't agree with it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's perfect. I'm all set. Is there anything else you'd like to</br> add before we wrap up?</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="5dbc0f3a-4a55-4018-ac4c-44b96a56d194" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Reflections, Empathy, Global/Human">Ana: I think it'd be really great for people to just probably do this kind<br>
 of thing, and I’m grateful that someone started it, grateful that someone's<br>
 doing it, and I really hope that it reaches a scope where everyone kind of<br>
 becomes interested in this and not necessarily for my story or anyone's<br>
 story, just because I think that sometimes humans forget we're all humans<br>
 and it doesn't matter whether you're Afghani, whether you're Haitian,<br>
 whether you're Dominican, Puerto Rican, et cetera, whether you're... So,<br>
 it's important to know that no matter what background you come from, you're<br>
 human, you just have to get to know the person. Yeah, there are assholes<br>
 out there, of course. Everyone has that. Yes, there are really nice people<br>
 and awesome people, but it's just the person and not their background. So<br>
 that's it.<br>

 me or the States gave me. The reality is that English is a very valued<br>
 asset here. I'm not sure, I think around the world, eventually, because it<br>
 has become the global language. So 10 years ago, when I first arrived and<br>
 nine years ago, when I first started looking for a job and such, that's<br>
 pretty much what sold me or what... I had zero prior experience minus the<br>
 bakery, and I didn't even mention it because it wasn't even... Really, if I<br>
 remember correctly, I don't know if it was just one or two weekends, but I<br>
 didn't like it. So I was like, &quot;I'm not doing this.&quot; And without any<br>
 experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always<br>
 tell you, &quot;we are hiring people,&quot; but it's only people with experience. So<br>
 all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went<br>
 to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was<br>
 horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were<br>
 over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the<br>
 supermarkets and such and people obviously wouldn't hire me. I couldn't<br>
 even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a<br>
 big no. And it wasn't until funnily enough, my mom, who was the one who<br>
 found out about call centers here. And she asked one of my cousins to take<br>
 me to one, and that's how I got my first job.<br>

 better, but when I meet new people now, one of the first question tends to<br>
 be, &quot;How long have you been in Mexico?&quot; &quot;I've been here 10 years.&quot; And<br>
 they're surprised to why my Spanish is still... It's like, &quot;We can still<br>
 tell you have an accent.&quot; Or when I get really nervous, my Spanish tends to<br>
 fuck up. And they're just like, &quot;But you've been here 10 years.&quot; And it's<br>
 kind of like, &quot;Yeah. Speaking Spanish, I've only done it for about six<br>
 years.&quot;<br>

 a little bit of human in everyone, but it's definitely not the same when<br>
 you have papers. In terms of care, it's kind of... I don't know how to<br>
 explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure<br>
 that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the<br>
 word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my<br>
 mom trying to ask, “What's wrong with her? What can they do?” Doctors just<br>
 going, &quot;She just needs birth control. Put her on birth control and that's<br>
 it.&quot; Me going on birth control and nothing, not helping. And my mom just<br>
 kind of desperate I would say, trying to get answers, falling again in the<br>
 hospital, getting more blood transfusion. It was basically just base work.<br>
 It wasn't someone actually asking you or checking to see if everything was<br>
 okay, it was mostly of, &quot;What's going on with you right now?&quot; &quot;I'm bleeding<br>
 out.&quot; And doctors going, &quot;Are you having an abortion? Are you…&quot;—A<br>
 miscarriage, sorry, here it's abortion—and it was just hard at that time<br>
 because there was a lot of negligence also. For example, at the time I was<br>
 still a virgin. And despite saying that I was not pregnant at all, there<br>
 was no possible way, the doctors still examined me. And you know not being<br>
 able to do anything legal for it because you couldn't, you're illegal. You<br>
 can't sue the doctor for malpractice because you're not even supposed to be<br>
 there. So it's always a lose-lose situation. So yeah, I would not say that<br>
 it's comfortable being undocumented and needing healthcare.<br>

      <br>
</span> Isabel: How did you migrate?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I, we migrated illegally. I don't remember how, but we crossed the</br> border.   </br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And you were six years old then?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And where did you live when you moved to the United States?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: We went directly to where my dad was. He was living in Brooklyn, New</br> York. So we went to live with him.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And do you remember any early memories or what was some of your</br> first experiences in the United States and even those surprised you.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I recall the school, the bilingual school, we were only there a year,</br> I have an older sister, my older sister and I. And then we were moved to</br> the elementary school where we finished our studies. I remember my</br> childhood in terms of like school and friends and such, but the first</br> memories of arriving there, I don't recall.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Can you tell me about then your childhood, both your schools and</br> your friends?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yeah. I don't remember much about my bilingual school. I just remember</br> that we were there a year, then in the other school where we finished. I</br> remember the school itself, the physical-ness of it, the weather. I</br> remember that I was a huge nerd. [Laughs]. I just focused on reading and</br> doing my schoolwork and finishing school and, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Do you have any teachers that stood out to you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yeah, my fifth-grade teacher, Mr. Ogami, really, really great in</br> teaching Math and such and books. And I remember my mom liked him also,</br> because of the program of the school, getting work done and memorizing</br> stuff. So yeah, he would definitely stand out.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's awesome. I’m wondering, did you have any classmates or</br> others who were also migrants or also had an undocumented status?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I don't think I actually know any, or I didn't make friends with any.</br> I think my parents probably knew more of those situations, my situation,</br> but on a personal level, no. In elementary, I don't remember anyone. I</br> remember that there were people from other countries like Afghanistan or</br> Bangladesh or Middle Eastern and Asians and such, but if I recall</br> correctly, all of them were American citizens.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And did you know, throughout your life, that you were undocumented</br> or did you find out about your status later?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I feel like I always knew, but I think as a kid, no one really</br> acknowledges what that is or you can't tell what people are explaining to</br> you until you get older. So I don't think I really knew until I was maybe</br> in middle school or… middle school.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Did that change your experience? Were you</br> frightened then of US authorities or the police in that sense or not.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Not really, but I think it's also because I didn't really…I wasn't one</br> to get into trouble. I wasn't one who was looking to commit a crime or</br> cause that kind of conflict or attention. I think it was a bigger deal for</br> my parents. I do remember them saying that we had to behave properly, or we</br> had to take care of how we were behaving to avoid the cops or to avoid the</br> police. But it wasn't something that I would say, I think, I would be</br> intimidated of their figure, but more on my parents’ account than my own.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. That makes sense. And a lot of people mention fear of driving</br> because if they they drive without a license, but probably weren't as much</br> in New York or...</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: No, or at least from... I don't remember how old I was, but my dad did</br> get a car. And so he would try to teach us to drive, my sisters and myself.</br> I don't recall it being an issue, trying to get a driver's license. I think</br> as I got older, I realized that it could have been a conflict, but I think</br> that he always looked into what state would be giving the driving...</br> Because I didn't know until I was older that only certain states provide</br> that. And so he would find it and he would go for it. But living in a city</br> like New York, it wasn't a necessity, having a car to move around and such,</br> it was more of what my dad wanted in life. So that's what he got.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And would you say you kept your, pretty much like academic rigor</br> through high school as you finished it, or?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I did up to high school. In high school, I felt, or I feel like I</br> started to rebel. Don't exactly remember what triggered it, but I do</br> remember that I was no longer too happy being where I was. I remember that</br> I would kind of bad talk New York or just be like, &quot;Oh, New York is ugly.&quot;</br> And then my parents decided to move on my senior year for in high school.</br> And so it just made me careless. I was just like, &quot;Okay well, I'm going to</br> move so I don't need to like work my ass off or put any effort into school</br> anymore, because we're going to go anyway, so.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Oh I see. some people mention feeling disheartened once they got to</br> high school, realizing without the proper documents, they wouldn't be able</br> to apply to college.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I feel like it hadn't reeled in on me or it wasn't something that…I</br> was aware of it, but I felt that I had so much support from friends or from</br> my own brain that I was just like, &quot;I'm going to accomplish it. Whether or</br> not it's going to be hard, I know what I want.&quot; At the time, I knew what I</br> wanted, and I was willing to just go for it. Basically, I didn't see myself</br> crashing and falling at that point. It was kind of my own carelessness of,</br> &quot;oh, we're moving, whatever,&quot; my own way, I think, of rebelling with my</br> parents that made me really careless with schoolwork for about a year. But</br> other than that, no. Despite the fact that I was painfully aware of the</br> illegal status and not being able to probably find a job, I think for me,</br> in long-term, it was the job. It wasn't even the school. It was just, one</br> way or another, you're going to be able to study. That's one of the</br> benefits of the States, right? It doesn't matter whether you're</br> undocumented or not, you're going to be able to study. Getting a job</br> though, and a job you want, that's a different story. So I think long-term,</br> for me, it was the job.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So then going from that, said your family moved, where did you move</br> to?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: North Carolina.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: North Carolina. And then how did you end up back in Mexico from</br> there?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Well, I got really sick. I got really depressed when we moved to North</br> Carolina and to this day, I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's what</br> triggered it, it's more than likely because it's the only thing I attribute</br> to my sickness. I started hemorrhaging. I started to bleed out and it got</br> to a point where it got really, really bad. I was hospitalized about four</br> times. And yeah, it just got really, really bad to a point where I just</br> didn't want to be hospitalized anymore. And so I told my parents that I</br> refused to get hospitalized and my parents said, &quot;Well, we bought you a</br> ticket to Mexico, so.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So your parents got you a ticket to Mexico so that you could</br> receive help here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yes. In Mexico, I have an uncle who's a doctor. So while I was in and</br> out of the hospital and I wasn't getting any better and I wasn't getting</br> any treatment, except blood transfusions and such, my mom sent my medical</br> records to my uncle. Don't really know what the discussion was there, I</br> just knew that she sent him my papers. And from what I know, my uncle told</br> my mom, &quot;You're either going to let her die there or you're going to send</br> her so that I can help her.&quot; So my parents were like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And they just</br> sat me down. They told me that I had to go get my passport because I was</br> coming to Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And was it difficult receiving healthcare in the States with your</br> undocumented status?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Definitely. I wouldn't say that people are harsh. I think that there's</br> a little bit of human in everyone, but it's definitely not the same when</br> you have papers. In terms of care, it's kind of... I don't know how to</br> explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure</br> that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the</br> word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my</br> mom trying to ask, “What's wrong with her? What can they do?” Doctors just</br> going, &quot;She just needs birth control. Put her on birth control and that's</br> it.&quot; Me going on birth control and nothing, not helping. And my mom just</br> kind of desperate I would say, trying to get answers, falling again in the</br> hospital, getting more blood transfusion. It was basically just base work.</br> It wasn't someone actually asking you or checking to see if everything was</br> okay, it was mostly of, &quot;What's going on with you right now?&quot; &quot;I'm bleeding</br> out.&quot; And doctors going, &quot;Are you having an abortion?

So it's always a lose-lose situation. So yeah, I would not say that</br> it's comfortable being undocumented and needing healthcare.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. That's a really unique perspective. So you were able to</br> receive better healthcare then on your return to Mexico with your uncle?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I'm not sure I would say better because even so it wasn't…even here. I</br> think healthcare in general is a whole 'nother world, but it definitely</br> stopped the hemorrhages. In terms of... It wasn't a long-term fix, but it</br> did get me better health-wise.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Obviously that's a whole different set of challenges to fac. In</br> terms of just returning to Mexico and living in the US for so long, what</br> was it like just reintegrating into Mexican society?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Integrating into Mexican society at first for me was inexistent in a</br> way. To be honest, for me, my experience was just very negative. I didn't</br> want to be here. So the whole first year of my stay, one was focusing on my</br> health. That's all I basically did for a whole year. Two was basically just</br> cry every single day. And three was question when I was going to go back.</br> It wasn't a matter of “I'm going to stay in Mexico.” It wasn't until it</br> was. So, it was hard, but... And the long term or in the long run, it's</br> actually been pretty good.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: In terms of, I guess... I know this is difficult. I'm really</br> grateful that you're willing to discuss it. That's really important to</br> hear. What do you think it was like being away from your family, being in a</br> new place? Just all of those things?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: I don't know. Here, I've met people who, immigrants. It's weird</br> because in New York, I don't remember anyone, but here I've met a whole</br> bunch of people and I think everyone has their own experience and I would</br> compare it to, well, maybe not compare it. It's just, I feel that the fact</br> that I didn't want to be here at first really affected the adapting into</br> the culture because, essentially, Mexico, long-term again, has been</br> wonderful. It's just, there is a lot of beauty, there's a lot of kindness,</br> if you know where to look, or even if not, but just, there is a lot of</br> good, but it took me a really long time to see it. It took me years to</br> acknowledge that I was in a place that I could enjoy being in. So the first</br> year adapting was just harsh. The second year onward after knowing, &quot;You</br> know what, if you're going to be here, you might as well do something with</br> your life,&quot; I said. That's when I started to look for a job, I started to</br> make friends, but I honestly refused to speak Spanish for the first four</br> years of being in Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: So a lot of people sometimes, for example, my Spanish has gotten much</br> better, but when I meet new people now, one of the first question tends to</br> be, &quot;How long have you been in Mexico?&quot; &quot;I've been here 10 years.&quot; And</br> they're surprised to why my Spanish is still... It's like, &quot;We can still</br> tell you have an accent.&quot; Or when I get really nervous, my Spanish tends to</br> fuck up. And they're just like, &quot;But you've been here 10 years.&quot; And it's</br> kind of like, &quot;Yeah. Speaking Spanish, I've only done it for about six</br> years.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Like been here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Right. So for me, just integrating into the culture, it's been baby</br> steps, I think. I think that's how I describe it. Just from the steps of</br> mourning, right? Acceptance, denial. Or I don't even know them in order,</br> but for a whole long time, it was just denial and then acceptance and now</br> really just flourishing into it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And mourning, mourning your life in the US or?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Mourning, I think more than anything, the loss of familiarity. I don't</br> really remember my childhood to be honest. When I grew up here, I remember</br> my grandparents and that's about it. So also adapting here in that sense,</br> was really weird. People going up to you and going, &quot;Oh, I remember when</br> you were so small.&quot; You would think that someone would appreciate that. You</br> would think that, &quot;Hey, that's cute.&quot; And for me, because of the attitude</br> that I had, for me it was just like, it was annoying. And it was like,</br> &quot;You're a stranger to me. Why are you telling me about you knowing me, you</br> don't know me.&quot; So, again, it was just really negative despite having</br> people going to me and talking to me about my parents or talking to me</br> about what they remember about my childhood. For me, it was not a welcome</br> thing. So, it was, yeah. So, it was a mourning of the loss of familiarity.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: So yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Do you think that your time in the US has shaped or it made you</br> different, giving you different skills or anything that you can use here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Well, English would definitely be a skill that I would say the US gave</br> me or the States gave me. The reality is that English is a very valued</br> asset here. I'm not sure, I think around the world, eventually, because it</br> has become the global language. So 10 years ago, when I first arrived and</br> nine years ago, when I first started looking for a job and such, that's</br> pretty much what sold me or what... I had zero prior experience minus the</br> bakery, and I didn't even mention it because it wasn't even... Really, if I</br> remember correctly, I don't know if it was just one or two weekends, but I</br> didn't like it. So I was like, &quot;I'm not doing this.&quot; And without any</br> experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always</br> tell you, &quot;we are hiring people,&quot; but it's only people with experience. So</br> all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went</br> to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was</br> horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were</br> over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the</br> supermarkets and such and people obviously wouldn't hire me. I couldn't</br> even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a</br> big no. And it wasn't until funnily enough, my mom, who was the one who</br> found out about call centers here. And she asked one of my cousins to take</br> me to one, and that's how I got my first job.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Right. Yeah. Other assets or-</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: It can even be mentality.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Skills, right?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah, anything.</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: That the States has given me, I actually do feel that it has shaped me</br> in many ways to be where I am now more than the States itself though. It's</br> weird because you don't really... I feel like you don't really know how</br> much is your parent, how much is your culture, how much is your siblings?</br> So for me, English is number one. I think I really enjoy the culture that</br> they have work-wise. Work-wise, or at least, despite the fact never having</br> worked there in school and such, it's a lot of no bullshit, you're here to</br> do what you're here to do. And one of the things that for me has been</br> really hard to adapt to here is that the culture in that sense is very</br> different. Despite the fact that Mexicans are such hard workers and they</br> are, sometimes they're also very lazy. And so I appreciate having grown up</br> in a culture where you don't really beat around the bush. It's direct, it's</br> to the point and it's not about just...</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: For example, one of the things where I was discussing, previously or</br> last week with a friend, is I'm the type of person that in a restaurant, if</br> I don't get a proper service or something, I speak up. And not necessarily,</br> not talking about rudely, just I speak up when it's normally not done here.</br> People tend to accept or just sit back and let things slide by. And I don't</br> think that that's something that happens a lot in the States, or didn't,</br> not speaking about the current government, but when I grew up there, it was</br> just flu—I remember that things were fluid. And I don't know if that's also</br> because as a kid, you don't notice or know of all the issues that are going</br> on around, but yeah, I would say to summarize: English, definitely; the</br> working mentality of no beating around the bush and directness; and kind of</br> going for what you want and not being rude about it, but just trying to get</br> your point across without hurting others.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Absolutely. Yeah. I think, I didn't consider that. Just some</br> closing questions in reflection, you can answer this how you want. Do you</br> consider yourself more Mexican or American?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Oh, that's a hard, hard question. So I consider myself more Mexican or</br> American. It's funny because just yesterday, there's a fair here. I'm not</br> sure if you're aware of it. It's called feria de las culturas amigas. it's</br> in Chapultepec, which is basically, it's a fair that happens every year. A</br> lot of whole different countries come, and they expose their culture. It's</br> beautiful. Yesterday, I was there and we stopped by US, a friend of mine</br> and me. It was really funny because he mentioned to me, he was like,</br> “you're more gringa, so this is where you should be.” And I was just like,</br> &quot;Ugh, no.&quot; Basically, I don't know. I think 10 years ago, if you would've</br> asked me, I would have said American, definitely. I think six years of</br> finally accepting where I am, really adapting to, trying to adapt to where</br> I currently am, I still wouldn't say…I'm leaning more towards Mexican, but</br> I think, I'm not sure.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And then if you had stayed in the US, what would you have done or</br> like to have done?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Had I followed my life plan when I was in the States, I was accepted</br> into Peace College. I wanted to study to be a physician. So I would've gone</br> for it. I would've finished school, probably gone into med school, finished</br> my physician career and become a physician. How? Even if I didn't stay</br> there, just get the degree and work on getting myself to a position.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And then now that you're in Mexico, you've been here for 10 years,</br> starting to come in that acceptance phase, I'm sure it fluctuates. What do</br> you think some of your current dreams are for your time in Mexico? What you</br> would like to do here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: My current dreams in Mexico is, or are to actually travel. One of the</br> huge benefits of being in your own country and working, or simply just</br> actually being legal is traveling. And I hadn't realized that I really</br> enjoyed it until I had it. So one of my biggest dreams is to continue</br> traveling. I want to continue knowing Mexico and there are really, really</br> beautiful places. I want to get to know other cultures and other countries,</br> and that's one of the freedoms than being a legal alien or a citizen allows</br> you to do. And I want to continue to grow professionally. I'm fortunate</br> enough to work in a global company. So my big, big goal is actually to</br> continue growing within the company and to be sent to a different part of</br> the globe to work.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I forget what a privilege it is just to be able to take my passport</br> and go somewhere. In terms of like, we were talking about earlier, a</br> binational identity. People say that you can, migrants sometimes, [feel</br> neither] here nor there, you're either too American to be Mexican or too</br> Mexican to be American. Do you see that as a phenomenon or how would you</br> respond to that?</br>      </br>      </br> Ana: Definitely. I think it's a phenomenon to be too much of something, but</br> I also think it has to do with people not really maybe exploring other</br> cultures as much. One of the things that I have definitely learned in this</br> experience, and I don't think I would have known, or it wouldn't have</br> shaped me as it has, is migrating here and having to adapt to the culture</br> and to the country itself, has shown me or opened my eyes a lot in terms</br> of, you know, everyone, as an individual is just who they decide to be.</br> When you don't have that perspective, honestly, when you grow up...

 it simply, when I first got here, and I considered myself a lot more<br>
 American than anything, quirks about people annoyed me or not their quirks,<br>
 just their ways of certain expressions or it's a way of doing something.<br>
 For me it was just like, &quot;Ugh, that's so not what I'm used to or that's so<br>
 not accepted.&quot; But now it's more, I feel that I've become more flexible in<br>
 that sense, with people, with culture, with everything. And yeah, I don't<br>
 really think that you open your eyes to that until you have to live it. And<br>
 so I definitely think it's a phenomenon to say you're too much of<br>
 something, but I don't agree with it.<br>

 there?<br>
      <br>

 Ana: Well, I got really sick. I got really depressed when we moved to North<br>
 Carolina and to this day, I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's what<br>
 triggered it, it's more than likely because it's the only thing I attribute<br>
 to my sickness. I started hemorrhaging. I started to bleed out and it got<br>
 to a point where it got really, really bad. I was hospitalized about four<br>
 times. And yeah, it just got really, really bad to a point where I just<br>
 didn't want to be hospitalized anymore. And so I told my parents that I<br>
 refused to get hospitalized and my parents said, &quot;Well, we bought you a<br>
 ticket to Mexico, so.&quot;<br>

 receive help here?<br>

 Ana: Yes. In Mexico, I have an uncle who's a doctor. So while I was in and<br>
 out of the hospital and I wasn't getting any better and I wasn't getting<br>
 any treatment, except blood transfusions and such, my mom sent my medical<br>
 records to my uncle. Don't really know what the discussion was there, I<br>
 just knew that she sent him my papers. And from what I know, my uncle told<br>
 my mom, &quot;You're either going to let her die there or you're going to send<br>
 her so that I can help her.&quot; So my parents were like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And they just<br>
 sat me down. They told me that I had to go get my passport because I was<br>
 coming to Mexico.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And was it difficult receiving healthcare in the States with your<br>
 undocumented status?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Definitely. I wouldn't say that people are harsh. I think that there's<br>
 a little bit of human in everyone, but it's definitely not the same when<br>
 you have papers. In terms of care, it's kind of... I don't know how to<br>
 explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure<br>
 that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the<br>
 word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my<br>
 mom trying to ask, “What's wrong with her? What can they do?” Doctors just<br>
 going, &quot;She just needs birth control. Put her on birth control and that's<br>
 it.&quot; Me going on birth control and nothing, not helping. And my mom just<br>
 kind of desperate I would say, trying to get answers, falling again in the<br>
 hospital, getting more blood transfusion. It was basically just base work.<br>
 It wasn't someone actually asking you or checking to see if everything was<br>
 okay, it was mostly of, &quot;What's going on with you right now?&quot; &quot;I'm bleeding<br>
 out.&quot; And doctors going, &quot;Are you having an abortion? Are you…&quot;—A<br>
 miscarriage, sorry, here it's abortion—and it was just hard at that time<br>
 because there was a lot of negligence also. For example, at the time I was<br>
 still a virgin. And despite saying that I was not pregnant at all, there<br>
 was no possible way, the doctors still examined me. And you know not being<br>
 able to do anything legal for it because you couldn't, you're illegal. You<br>
 can't sue the doctor for malpractice because you're not even supposed to be<br>
 there. So it's always a lose-lose situation. So yeah, I would not say that<br>
 it's comfortable being undocumented and needing healthcare.<br>
      <br>

 cause that kind of conflict or attention. I think it was a bigger deal for<br>
 my parents. I do remember them saying that we had to behave properly, or we<br>
 had to take care of how we were behaving to avoid the cops or to avoid the<br>

 first experiences in the United States and even those surprised you.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: I recall the school, the bilingual school, we were only there a year,<br>
 I have an older sister, my older sister and I. And then we were moved to<br>
 the elementary school where we finished our studies. I remember my<br>
 childhood in terms of like school and friends and such, but the first<br>
 memories of arriving there, I don't recall.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Can you tell me about then your childhood, both your schools and<br>
 your friends?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Yeah. I don't remember much about my bilingual school. I just remember<br>
 that we were there a year, then in the other school where we finished. I<br>
 remember the school itself, the physical-ness of it, the weather. I<br>
 remember that I was a huge nerd. [Laughs]. I just focused on reading and<br>
 doing my schoolwork and finishing school and, yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Yeah, my fifth-grade teacher, Mr. Ogami, really, really great in<br>
 teaching Math and such and books. And I remember my mom liked him also,<br>
 because of the program of the school, getting work done and memorizing<br>
 stuff. So yeah, he would definitely stand out.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Isabel: That's awesome. I’m wondering, did you have any classmates or<br>
 others who were also migrants or also had an undocumented status?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: I don't think I actually know any, or I didn't make friends with any.<br>
 I think my parents probably knew more of those situations, my situation,<br>
 but on a personal level, no. In elementary, I don't remember anyone. I<br>
 remember that there were people from other countries like Afghanistan or<br>
 Bangladesh or Middle Eastern and Asians and such, but if I recall<br>
 correctly, all of them were American citizens.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And did you know, throughout your life, that you were undocumented<br>
 or did you find out about your status later?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: I feel like I always knew, but I think as a kid, no one really<br>
 acknowledges what that is or you can't tell what people are explaining to<br>
 you until you get older. So I don't think I really knew until I was maybe<br>
 in middle school or… middle school.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Did that change your experience? Were you<br>
 frightened then of US authorities or the police in that sense or not.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Not really, but I think it's also because I didn't really…I wasn't one<br>
 to get into trouble. I wasn't one who was looking to commit a crime or<br>
 cause that kind of conflict or attention. I think it was a bigger deal for<br>
 my parents. I do remember them saying that we had to behave properly, or we<br>

 because if they they drive without a license, but probably weren't as much<br>

 it was more of what my dad wanted in life. So that's what he got.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And would you say you kept your, pretty much like academic rigor<br>
 through high school as you finished it, or?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: I did up to high school. In high school, I felt, or I feel like I<br>
 started to rebel. Don't exactly remember what triggered it, but I do<br>
 remember that I was no longer too happy being where I was. I remember that<br>
 I would kind of bad talk New York or just be like, &quot;Oh, New York is ugly.&quot;<br>
 And then my parents decided to move on my senior year for in high school.<br>
 And so it just made me careless. I was just like, &quot;Okay well, I'm going to<br>
 move so I don't need to like work my ass off or put any effort into school<br>
 anymore, because we're going to go anyway, so.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Oh I see. some people mention feeling disheartened once they got to<br>
 high school, realizing without the proper documents, they wouldn't be able<br>
 to apply to college.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: I feel like it hadn't reeled in on me or it wasn't something that…I<br>
 was aware of it, but I felt that I had so much support from friends or from<br>
 my own brain that I was just like, &quot;I'm going to accomplish it. Whether or<br>
 not it's going to be hard, I know what I want.&quot; At the time, I knew what I<br>
 wanted, and I was willing to just go for it. Basically, I didn't see myself<br>
 crashing and falling at that point. It was kind of my own carelessness of,<br>
 &quot;oh, we're moving, whatever,&quot; my own way, I think, of rebelling with my<br>
 parents that made me really careless with schoolwork for about a year. But<br>
 other than that, no. Despite the fact that I was painfully aware of the<br>
 illegal status and not being able to probably find a job, I think for me,<br>
 in long-term, it was the job. It wasn't even the school. It was just, one<br>
 way or another, you're going to be able to study. That's one of the<br>
 benefits of the States, right? It doesn't matter whether you're<br>
 undocumented or not, you're going to be able to study. Getting a job<br>
 though, and a job you want, that's a different story. So I think long-term,<br>
 for me, it was the job.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: So then going from that, said your family moved, where did you move<br>
 to?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: North Carolina.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: North Carolina. And then how did you end up back in Mexico from<br>
 there?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Well, I got really sick. I got really depressed when we moved to North<br>
 Carolina and to this day, I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's what<br>
 triggered it, it's more than likely because it's the only thing I attribute<br>
 to my sickness. I started hemorrhaging. I started to bleed out and it got<br>
 to a point where it got really, really bad. I was hospitalized about four<br>
 times. And yeah, it just got really, really bad to a point where I just<br>
 didn't want to be hospitalized anymore. And so I told my parents that I<br>
 refused to get hospitalized and my parents said, &quot;Well, we bought you a<br>
 ticket to Mexico, so.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: So your parents got you a ticket to Mexico so that you could<br>
 receive help here?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Yes. In Mexico, I have an uncle who's a doctor. So while I was in and<br>
 out of the hospital and I wasn't getting any better and I wasn't getting<br>
 any treatment, except blood transfusions and such, my mom sent my medical<br>
 records to my uncle. Don't really know what the discussion was there, I<br>
 just knew that she sent him my papers. And from what I know, my uncle told<br>
 my mom, &quot;You're either going to let her die there or you're going to send<br>
 her so that I can help her.&quot; So my parents were like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And they just<br>
 sat me down. They told me that I had to go get my passport because I was<br>
 coming to Mexico.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And was it difficult receiving healthcare in the States with your<br>
 undocumented status?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Definitely. I wouldn't say that people are harsh. I think that there's<br>
 a little bit of human in everyone, but it's definitely not the same when<br>
 you have papers. In terms of care, it's kind of... I don't know how to<br>
 explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure<br>
 that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the<br>
 word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my<br>
 mom trying to ask, “What's wrong with her? What can they do?” Doctors just<br>
 going, &quot;She just needs birth control. Put her on birth control and that's<br>
 it.&quot; Me going on birth control and nothing, not helping. And my mom just<br>
 kind of desperate I would say, trying to get answers, falling again in the<br>
 hospital, getting more blood transfusion. It was basically just base work.<br>
 It wasn't someone actually asking you or checking to see if everything was<br>
 okay, it was mostly of, &quot;What's going on with you right now?&quot; &quot;I'm bleeding<br>
 out.&quot; And doctors going, &quot;Are you having an abortion? Are you…&quot;—A<br>
 miscarriage, sorry, here it's abortion—and it was just hard at that time<br>
 because there was a lot of negligence also. For example, at the time I was<br>
 still a virgin. And despite saying that I was not pregnant at all, there<br>
 was no possible way, the doctors still examined me. And you know not being<br>
 able to do anything legal for it because you couldn't, you're illegal. You<br>
 can't sue the doctor for malpractice because you're not even supposed to be<br>
 there. So it's always a lose-lose situation. So yeah, I would not say that<br>
 it's comfortable being undocumented and needing healthcare.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Yeah. That's a really unique perspective. So you were able to<br>
 receive better healthcare then on your return to Mexico with your uncle?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: I'm not sure I would say better because even so it wasn't…even here. I<br>
 think healthcare in general is a whole 'nother world, but it definitely<br>
 stopped the hemorrhages. In terms of... It wasn't a long-term fix, but it<br>
 did get me better health-wise.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Obviously that's a whole different set of challenges to fac. In<br>
 terms of just returning to Mexico and living in the US for so long, what<br>
 was it like just reintegrating into Mexican society?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Integrating into Mexican society at first for me was inexistent in a<br>
 way. To be honest, for me, my experience was just very negative. I didn't<br>
 want to be here. So the whole first year of my stay, one was focusing on my<br>
 health. That's all I basically did for a whole year. Two was basically just<br>
 cry every single day. And three was question when I was going to go back.<br>
 It wasn't a matter of “I'm going to stay in Mexico.” It wasn't until it<br>
 was. So, it was hard, but... And the long term or in the long run, it's<br>
 actually been pretty good.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Really?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: In terms of, I guess... I know this is difficult. I'm really<br>
 grateful that you're willing to discuss it. That's really important to<br>
 hear. What do you think it was like being away from your family, being in a<br>
 new place? Just all of those things?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: I don't know. Here, I've met people who, immigrants. It's weird<br>
 because in New York, I don't remember anyone, but here I've met a whole<br>
 bunch of people and I think everyone has their own experience and I would<br>
 compare it to, well, maybe not compare it. It's just, I feel that the fact<br>
 that I didn't want to be here at first really affected the adapting into<br>
 the culture because, essentially, Mexico, long-term again, has been<br>
 wonderful. It's just, there is a lot of beauty, there's a lot of kindness,<br>
 if you know where to look, or even if not, but just, there is a lot of<br>
 good, but it took me a really long time to see it. It took me years to<br>
 acknowledge that I was in a place that I could enjoy being in. So the first<br>
 year adapting was just harsh. The second year onward after knowing, &quot;You<br>
 know what, if you're going to be here, you might as well do something with<br>
 your life,&quot; I said. That's when I started to look for a job, I started to<br>
 make friends, but I honestly refused to speak Spanish for the first four<br>
 years of being in Mexico.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Wow.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: So a lot of people sometimes, for example, my Spanish has gotten much<br>
 better, but when I meet new people now, one of the first question tends to<br>
 be, &quot;How long have you been in Mexico?&quot; &quot;I've been here 10 years.&quot; And<br>
 they're surprised to why my Spanish is still... It's like, &quot;We can still<br>
 tell you have an accent.&quot; Or when I get really nervous, my Spanish tends to<br>
 fuck up. And they're just like, &quot;But you've been here 10 years.&quot; And it's<br>
 kind of like, &quot;Yeah. Speaking Spanish, I've only done it for about six<br>
 years.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Like been here?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Right. So for me, just integrating into the culture, it's been baby<br>
 steps, I think. I think that's how I describe it. Just from the steps of<br>
 mourning, right? Acceptance, denial. Or I don't even know them in order,<br>
 but for a whole long time, it was just denial and then acceptance and now<br>
 really just flourishing into it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And mourning, mourning your life in the US or?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Mourning, I think more than anything, the loss of familiarity. I don't<br>
 really remember my childhood to be honest. When I grew up here, I remember<br>
 my grandparents and that's about it. So also adapting here in that sense,<br>
 was really weird. People going up to you and going, &quot;Oh, I remember when<br>
 you were so small.&quot; You would think that someone would appreciate that. You<br>
 would think that, &quot;Hey, that's cute.&quot; And for me, because of the attitude<br>
 that I had, for me it was just like, it was annoying. And it was like,<br>
 &quot;You're a stranger to me. Why are you telling me about you knowing me, you<br>
 don't know me.&quot; So, again, it was just really negative despite having<br>
 people going to me and talking to me about my parents or talking to me<br>
 about what they remember about my childhood. For me, it was not a welcome<br>
 thing. So, it was, yeah. So, it was a mourning of the loss of familiarity.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: So yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Do you think that your time in the US has shaped or it made you<br>
 different, giving you different skills or anything that you can use here?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Well, English would definitely be a skill that I would say the US gave<br>
 me or the States gave me. The reality is that English is a very valued<br>
 asset here. I'm not sure, I think around the world, eventually, because it<br>
 has become the global language. So 10 years ago, when I first arrived and<br>
 nine years ago, when I first started looking for a job and such, that's<br>
 pretty much what sold me or what... I had zero prior experience minus the<br>
 bakery, and I didn't even mention it because it wasn't even... Really, if I<br>
 remember correctly, I don't know if it was just one or two weekends, but I<br>
 didn't like it. So I was like, &quot;I'm not doing this.&quot; And without any<br>
 experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always<br>
 tell you, &quot;we are hiring people,&quot; but it's only people with experience. So<br>
 all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went<br>
 to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was<br>
 horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were<br>
 over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the<br>
 supermarkets and such and people obviously wouldn't hire me. I couldn't<br>
 even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a<br>
 big no. And it wasn't until funnily enough, my mom, who was the one who<br>
 found out about call centers here. And she asked one of my cousins to take<br>
 me to one, and that's how I got my first job.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Right. Yeah. Other assets or-<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: It can even be mentality.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Skills, right?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Yeah, anything.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: That the States has given me, I actually do feel that it has shaped me<br>
 in many ways to be where I am now more than the States itself though. It's<br>
 weird because you don't really... I feel like you don't really know how<br>
 much is your parent, how much is your culture, how much is your siblings?<br>
 So for me, English is number one. I think I really enjoy the culture that<br>
 they have work-wise. Work-wise, or at least, despite the fact never having<br>
 worked there in school and such, it's a lot of no bullshit, you're here to<br>
 do what you're here to do. And one of the things that for me has been<br>
 really hard to adapt to here is that the culture in that sense is very<br>
 different. Despite the fact that Mexicans are such hard workers and they<br>
 are, sometimes they're also very lazy. And so I appreciate having grown up<br>
 in a culture where you don't really beat around the bush. It's direct, it's<br>
 to the point and it's not about just...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: For example, one of the things where I was discussing, previously or<br>
 last week with a friend, is I'm the type of person that in a restaurant, if<br>
 I don't get a proper service or something, I speak up. And not necessarily,<br>
 not talking about rudely, just I speak up when it's normally not done here.<br>
 People tend to accept or just sit back and let things slide by. And I don't<br>
 think that that's something that happens a lot in the States, or didn't,<br>
 not speaking about the current government, but when I grew up there, it was<br>
 just flu—I remember that things were fluid. And I don't know if that's also<br>
 because as a kid, you don't notice or know of all the issues that are going<br>
 on around, but yeah, I would say to summarize: English, definitely; the<br>
 working mentality of no beating around the bush and directness; and kind of<br>
 going for what you want and not being rude about it, but just trying to get<br>
 your point across without hurting others.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Absolutely. Yeah. I think, I didn't consider that. Just some<br>
 closing questions in reflection, you can answer this how you want. Do you<br>
 consider yourself more Mexican or American?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Oh, that's a hard, hard question. So I consider myself more Mexican or<br>
 American. It's funny because just yesterday, there's a fair here. I'm not<br>
 sure if you're aware of it. It's called feria de las culturas amigas. it's<br>
 in Chapultepec, which is basically, it's a fair that happens every year. A<br>
 lot of whole different countries come, and they expose their culture. It's<br>
 beautiful. Yesterday, I was there and we stopped by US, a friend of mine<br>
 and me. It was really funny because he mentioned to me, he was like,<br>
 “you're more gringa, so this is where you should be.” And I was just like,<br>
 &quot;Ugh, no.&quot; Basically, I don't know. I think 10 years ago, if you would've<br>
 asked me, I would have said American, definitely. I think six years of<br>
 finally accepting where I am, really adapting to, trying to adapt to where<br>
 I currently am, I still wouldn't say…I'm leaning more towards Mexican, but<br>
 I think, I'm not sure.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And then if you had stayed in the US, what would you have done or<br>
 like to have done?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Had I followed my life plan when I was in the States, I was accepted<br>
 into Peace College. I wanted to study to be a physician. So I would've gone<br>
 for it. I would've finished school, probably gone into med school, finished<br>
 my physician career and become a physician. How? Even if I didn't stay<br>
 there, just get the degree and work on getting myself to a position.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And then now that you're in Mexico, you've been here for 10 years,<br>
 starting to come in that acceptance phase, I'm sure it fluctuates. What do<br>
 you think some of your current dreams are for your time in Mexico? What you<br>
 would like to do here?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: My current dreams in Mexico is, or are to actually travel. One of the<br>
 huge benefits of being in your own country and working, or simply just<br>
 actually being legal is traveling. And I hadn't realized that I really<br>
 enjoyed it until I had it. So one of my biggest dreams is to continue<br>
 traveling. I want to continue knowing Mexico and there are really, really<br>
 beautiful places. I want to get to know other cultures and other countries,<br>
 and that's one of the freedoms than being a legal alien or a citizen allows<br>
 you to do. And I want to continue to grow professionally. I'm fortunate<br>
 enough to work in a global company. So my big, big goal is actually to<br>
 continue growing within the company and to be sent to a different part of<br>
 the globe to work.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I forget what a privilege it is just to be able to take my passport<br>
 and go somewhere. In terms of like, we were talking about earlier, a<br>
 binational identity. People say that you can, migrants sometimes, [feel<br>
 neither] here nor there, you're either too American to be Mexican or too<br>
 Mexican to be American. Do you see that as a phenomenon or how would you<br>
 respond to that?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Definitely. I think it's a phenomenon to be too much of something, but<br>
 I also think it has to do with people not really maybe exploring other<br>
 cultures as much. One of the things that I have definitely learned in this<br>
 experience, and I don't think I would have known, or it wouldn't have<br>
 shaped me as it has, is migrating here and having to adapt to the culture<br>
 and to the country itself, has shown me or opened my eyes a lot in terms<br>
 of, you know, everyone, as an individual is just who they decide to be.<br>
 When you don't have that perspective, honestly, when you grow up... Putting<br>
 it simply, when I first got here, and I considered myself a lot more<br>
 American than anything, quirks about people annoyed me or not their quirks,<br>
 just their ways of certain expressions or it's a way of doing something.<br>
 For me it was just like, &quot;Ugh, that's so not what I'm used to or that's so<br>
 not accepted.&quot; But now it's more, I feel that I've become more flexible in<br>
 that sense, with people, with culture, with everything. And yeah, I don't<br>
 really think that you open your eyes to that until you have to live it. And<br>
 so I definitely think it's a phenomenon to say you're too much of<br>
 something, but I don't agree with it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's perfect. I'm all set. Is there anything else you'd like to<br>
 add before we wrap up?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: I think it'd be really great for people to just probably do this kind<br>
 of thing, and I’m grateful that someone started it, grateful that someone's<br>
 doing it, and I really hope that it reaches a scope where everyone kind of<br>
 becomes interested in this and not necessarily for my story or anyone's<br>
 story, just because I think that sometimes humans forget we're all humans<br>
 and it doesn't matter whether you're Afghani, whether you're Haitian,<br>
 whether you're Dominican, Puerto Rican, et cetera, whether you're... So,<br>
 it's important to know that no matter what background you come from, you're<br>
 human, you just have to get to know the person. Yeah, there are assholes<br>
 out there, of course. Everyone has that. Yes, there are really nice people<br>
 and awesome people, but it's just the person and not their background. So<br>
 that's it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I wouldn't even want to add my voice. That was so perfect. Thank<br>
 you so much for sharing and contributing to this. I also hope that it can<br>
 reach that scope and bring some humanity to people who maybe don't see it<br>
 right now. Perfect.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ana: Thank you.<br>
