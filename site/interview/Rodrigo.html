Your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> day there? That's</br>   what I wanted to hear about.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, pretty much, it was something different. I mean, you are</br>   used to be right here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, where I was used to being right here in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. To go over there, to see different people, pretty much, the</br>   differences, how people speak, because it was really different. I didn't</br>   know anything about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. We were like, &quot;What are they talking about?&quot;</br>   We were like, &quot;What?&quot; That's the only word I knew. But it was pretty much</br>   good. But at first it was like even the TV, the news, everything was</br>   different. I was a kid. I mean, the way you see, I was a kid and it was</br>   really different. I tried to play with the other kids, but they couldn’t</br>   speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, and I couldn’t speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Where did you arrive?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: First of all, I arrived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yes. Is that where you lived <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, I just arrived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span>. From there, I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>. Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: It was far away from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span> for a while?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, first of all, let me explain to you how it was. I cross the</br>   border, and I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. From <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span>, my aunts, they went from</br>   Minnesota to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span>, to pick me up. From there, I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>. It was</br>   close by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>. So, from there, it was pretty much, &quot;Oh my God, there is a</br>   lot of white people.&quot; So, it was hard for me to talk to anybody. When I</br>   went, first of all, I did like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five days</span> to stay at home, to get clothes</br>   because pretty much, we didn't have any clothes. So, first of all, we have</br>   to get clothes, get used to it. Then from there, we went to the school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay, so I have questions for you. What month was it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: That was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">April</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, was it still cold? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. Yes. I still see a lot of snow at that time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Is that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time you saw snow?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No. One time I was right here, by ___, that was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time</br>   that I see a lot of snow. Then I went to the school, and it was really,</br>   really hard for me because I couldn't say, &quot;May I go to the restroom?&quot; I</br>   couldn't check anything. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">The first day</span> for me was horrible. Because I</br>   didn't know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. I didn't know anybody. I was a really different person</br>   than the students from there. They just looked at me like, &quot;Who are you?&quot;</br>   Some people would talk to me, and I was like [gestures] with signs. Then</br>   they put me with a tutor. It was just pretty much, all the year, I stayed</br>   with the tutor all the time, just learning <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Was the tutor nice?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. I still remember she was nice to me. Then from there, I</br>   pretty much, I didn't learn a lot, but I learned how to ask for food, to go</br>   to the restroom. Small things. That was in the beginning. Then from</br>   there—that was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">8th</span> grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">8th</span> grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Because when I started over there, I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">8th</span> grade. Then from</br>   there, I moved to my aunt’s because my dad left me over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, your dad took you over?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: He took me over, but then he left me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Where did he go?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: To <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span>. And then he went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span>, and from there, we haven't</br>   talked since then.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You haven't talked until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">today</span>, with your dad?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">today</span>, I haven't. He found somebody else, and he got</br>   married, I guess. He just forgot about me. So, I started living with my</br>   mom's side of the family, with my aunts, and my grandma and grandpa. They</br>   would help me a lot. Then from there, from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>, they wanted to move</br>   to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. So we moved to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. I started high school, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">9th</span> grade</br>   to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">12th</span> grade, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Where in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I don't know if you know the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Central Valley</span> area. It's a small</br>   town, it's called _________, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. Pretty much all of my family lives</br>   there, and around there. My mom had a big family. There were like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">13</span></br>   brothers in total. So, it was a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So why <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Because they live over there. To be honest with you, one of the</br>   reasons that now I get it is because in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>, they didn't have a lot</br>   of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> people. So, when you apply over there to get an</br>   immigration—because my aunts, they were trying to get the residential for</br>   my uncles, for their husbands—it was more faster for them to do it over</br>   there. So, they moved over there. Then they started buying houses. That's</br>   why we stayed there, for a while. Then they come back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span> when</br>   they get their papers, and some of my uncles, they stay in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>, and</br>   some, they stay in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow. So, was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span> better than <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Pretty much, yes, and no.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I have to be honest with you, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, there were more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latin</span></br>   people, more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> people, more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. I will say that, where we</br>   live. It was easier for me because they have more programs on the high</br>   school to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. We have the ESL, ESL <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span>, ESL <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>, ESL <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span>. That</br>   helped me a lot. It was better because I was used to being always at home</br>   back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>, and over here, not, because it was more sunny. It was</br>   better. It was more familiar with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So how many years were you in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: That's another story. I stayed in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span> for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six, nine months</span></br>   in the beginning. Then I moved to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, and as soon as I finished the</br>   high school, I moved to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span> again.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why did you move back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Because I finished high school, and I couldn't go to the college,</br>   because I didn't have a social security number. So, I didn't have a way to</br>   keep studying. I had to work. The only work that they have over there, it</br>   was pretty much for people that don't have papers, was the fields. I didn't</br>   have a way to – a car or something to move.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you work in the fields at all?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. On <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the summer</span>. Summer I used to work on the fields, just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two   or</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three weeks</span>, just to get some money to buy my clothes for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the new year</span>.</br>   So that's what I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So what did you do in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Picking onions, and the cotton.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Cotton?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">the Central Valley</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: In the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Central Valley</span> area. That's what I did. It was not a lot. I</br>   didn't work, like I say. I used to work for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three weeks</span>, and then from</br>   there, I would be at home. Just to get some money to buy my clothes for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the   new year</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, when you worked in the fields, you worked with other <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Who were working full-time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How was that? Did they say, &quot;You lucky kid, you're going to school?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No. Pretty much, I used to work with my aunts. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> of my aunts,</br>   the one that raised me, she would go with me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: She worked in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. She would go with me, and she would take a look at me, keep</br>   an eye on me, just so nothing happens, because, you know, the border patrol</br>   and immigration would go in the fields. So, she always was there for me.</br>   She's like the main [inaudible].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What year is this in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I'm talking about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">'98 to 2001</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, your aunts really wanted you to finish school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. Pretty much, I grew up with them. My mom was here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br>   But pretty much, they helped me a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did they have children of their own?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. Yes, my cousins, my little cousins. They're not little</br>   anymore. I'm like the big brother for them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How much older were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span> when I moved to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow. They were how old?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: They were like five, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>. They were not old.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, were your friends mainly <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. First of all, it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. Then when I started getting to</br>   know them a little bit more, and then started speaking more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, then I</br>   started getting <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> that were born there, they’re called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chicanos</span>.</br>   Other <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. Pretty much, it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you have any friends that weren't <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chicano</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Pretty much in the beginning it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. Then after that, it</br>   was more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chicanos</span> too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What about others?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Not really. Not in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. It's because pretty much all of the</br>   people are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chicano</span>. You could find some other kinds of people,</br>   but that's ...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What about school? Were there other kind of people at school? Or was</br>   everybody at school <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chicano</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No, I mean, it was ... How can I say it? Because I didn't know</br>   enough English. They would put you aside. Not aside, but they would put</br>   you, &quot;Okay, you don't talk <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, you have to go to ESL class.&quot; &quot;Okay,</br>   you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, you're fine, you went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> class.&quot; It was different</br>   because all of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, that we didn't know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, we were all in</br>   the same classes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Central Americans</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I didn't have that many right there in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. It was probably</br>   a field thing, from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guatemala</span>. It was probably <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">a few, like five</span>, it wasn't</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay, so you couldn't find a job that wouldn't have been in the</br>   fields after finishing high school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: After finishing high school. Then from there, I moved back to</br>   Minnesota. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>, that's when I started working in a fiberglass</br>   company. We used to make snowmobiles, all of that kind of parts. Even the</br>   front end from the buses, they are made from fiberglass. Even parts for</br>   airplanes. We used to make them, because they're made of fiberglass. That's</br>   where I knew more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. That's when I started getting along with white</br>   people. Right there, I met more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Central American</span> people. That was more</br>   different, because over there, there is not a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. So that's</br>   where I learned more skills in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. At the same time, how they lived.</br>   White people, how they lived, black people, how they lived. We will see a</br>   few black people there. But we will see <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Indian</span> people, how they lived.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Bosnian</span> people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What was different about the way that the white people lived to the</br>   way the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> lived?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, pretty much it depends on the persons because you could find</br>   a racist person, or you could find a person that tried to be a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>—or</br>   not to be a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> but get someone with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. That's when you compared</br>   those persons. Because some people, they don't care, they just see you, and</br>   some persons, they want to know how you lived, how everything goes. Some</br>   persons, they don't even care about you. When that happens, I got to know a</br>   lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> people. We used to get along. I will say that they were my</br>   best friends.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. At that point, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> restaurants? What did you do with them? How</br>   did you hang out with these people?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Pretty much, they were from work. On the weekends, we didn't work</br>   on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Saturday</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Sunday</span>. So sometimes they would show up at the house, and</br>   we will cook out. Even sometimes the weather wouldn't let us, we would</br>   cookout in the garage. That's something that we would do.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What did you cook?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Everything. I mean, even they tried carnitas, carne asada.</br>   [grilled meat] I don’t know if you know tripa [intestine]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yes. They tried tripa?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. One of my best friends, he loves guacamole. It was something</br>   new for them at that time because it was like nobody knew that guacamole</br>   was avocado. It was something new for them. He would love that. He would</br>   always be like, &quot;I brought some chips, you make the guacamole.&quot; He will</br>   show up at the house, and we will make it. He would get along with my</br>   aunts, with my uncles. He was like a part of the family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What food did he cook for you? Did they cook for you too?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: They just wanted <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> food.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. His food was pizza, that was all. Pizzas and hamburgers.</br>   Sometimes we would be like, &quot;Let's go out to eat.&quot; &quot;Yeah, let's go.&quot; He</br>   would go, &quot;No, I want some pizza. I want some hamburgers.&quot; I would be like,</br>   &quot;Let's go to my house, let's see what thing we can make.&quot; <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> thing he</br>   would love, it was tinga. I don't know if you know—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yes, I know what tinga is. My favorite tacos.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. We would make it—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: With chicken?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah, with chicken, and onions, and chipotle.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: It's very good. Did you ever go in a snowmobile while you were</br>   there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. Yes, I went on the snowmobile, ice fishing. We would go to</br>   the rivers, and sometimes, especially over there, the ice would be this</br>   much. So, you could close the river and everything. We would go in a</br>   snowmobile. Where I used to work, we made something that is called a</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">SnoBear</span>. That's like for people that like to go snowmobile, or to go ice</br>   fishing. Sorry. So you got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">six</span> holes, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> in this side, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> in the</br>   other side. You would have a seat for each one. Then you would just go ice</br>   fishing right there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you would sit on the ice through a hole?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. But it wasn't like a big snowmobile. It's called a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">SnoBear</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh, I see. So they were special snowmobiles to go fishing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. It would be like a van, and you will have the special thing</br>   like a snowmobile, and you will have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> holes right here, but you would</br>   have the seat by the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> holes, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I see. Did you get used to the cold then?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes, I got used to it. I mean, I lived there for a while. I lived</br>   there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three or four years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, there were there other <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> who went snowmobiling and did</br>   all of this?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah, pretty much it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>, because we would get</br>   along. Yeah, we would go. Even in, I still got friends from over there,</br>   they still go ice fishing, and they send me pictures still.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you stayed there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, I stayed there <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>. Then I came</br>   back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I went to work—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: At the fiberglass factory?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. I get off from work, and I would have to drive <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">around 45</span></br>   minutes. I got stopped by the stop sign, for the light, for the back-up</br>   light. It was a sheriff, and he just asked for the driver's license. I have</br>   only the permit license. So, he asked me for if I was a resident, if I</br>   could show any proof. I was honest with him. &quot;No, I'm not.&quot; So, he right</br>   away called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Border Patrol</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Really?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What year is this?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: That was I think <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2002</span>? But from then, I already had a daughter</br>   right there. I was married.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You were married to a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: To a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chicana</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You didn't get residency?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: That's another story. [laughs]. No, from there I got deported.</br>   They called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Border Patrol</span>. From <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Border Patrol</span>, they told me that they will</br>   let me go, but I will have to go to court because I already had a daughter,</br>   and I was married, and I had a baby coming. So, from there, I went to court</br>   and everything. But when I went to court, they deported me. So, they gave</br>   me some time to come back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. So that's been, already, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">11 years</span>.</br>   They gave me papers, so I have to come back over here. I came back with my</br>   daughter, because my son, he was only <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three months</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What about your wife?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: She stayed over there. But we already made the papers, so we could</br>   fix the residence. But from then, I came over here, and this is a sad</br>   story. I came over here with my daughter, and she was with my son over</br>   there. She came over here, but she was pregnant from somebody else.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. So, from there, she came over here, we tried to fix things.</br>   It didn't work out. I mean, it worked out for a little bit. She went back</br>   to have the baby, and she took my daughter, and she left me my son. So, she</br>   left, and she had the baby, and from there, she didn't fix my papers</br>   anymore. I stayed with my son right here. Right now, I'm a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You're a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. My son is from over there, he's already <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">11 years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: He's living with you? He's an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: He's an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. He's living with me. He lives right here; he</br>   goes to school right here. He's going to turn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12 years old</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next month</span>. I</br>   can't take him back because he doesn't know his mom, and he doesn't want to</br>   know nothing about his mom. He wants to go back with my aunts, but it's</br>   kind of hard. He doesn't want to let me go. I want him to go over there,</br>   but he doesn't want to go without me, and I'm not going back without my</br>   papers. Illegally, I'm not going back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What was it like for you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: It was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What was hard?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Everything. Because I didn't know my mom, because I left for so</br>   much time. I didn't know my brother and my sister because they never went</br>   over there. I came over here, I couldn't find a job. I didn't know how to</br>   work right here. It was everything different for us. Plus, because we had</br>   tattoos, they were kind of racist, like in the face. Because you got a</br>   tattoo, you cannot get a job. Then it was hard for me to find a job,</br>   because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> of all, I didn't have all of my papers, like the security</br>   number that we have right here. So, I started working in a restaurant. From</br>   there, I started looking for other jobs. From there, I started working in a</br>   gas station. Whatever I will put the gas, and whatever they will give me,</br>   that's it. That would be what I get.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That's it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: That's it. Plus, I will have to pay to the gas station for me</br>   working there. Yeah. When you go right here, and you see the gas stations,</br>   the people that work there, they only work for the tips. They will have to</br>   still pay for that, to the gas station, to be working there. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Then from there, I met this person, on the metro. And I found</br>   TeleTech. I started working there. I worked for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>. I started at</br>   zero, by nothing. I didn't know anything about call centers. From there, I</br>   went to [inaudible] for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nine months</span>. From there, I stayed there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three   years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What company do you work for?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Right now, I started working for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Alliance</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: The insurance company?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: The insurance company. I got like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three weeks</span> that I started</br>   there. But before that, I worked at AT&amp;amp;T.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. I haven't started working. I worked <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span> for</br>   TeleTech. As soon as I finished with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">TeleTech</span>, I went to AT&amp;amp;T. I was</br>   already hired, and then I quit over here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So how long were you with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">AT&amp;amp;T?</span></br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">A year</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You did customer service for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">AT&amp;amp;T?</span></br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. Customer service. I assume. I worked—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That's my phone company.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Good luck. [laughs]. I mean, it's pretty good. As long as you know</br>   the terms and conditions, which we don't really read that much. That's what</br>   happens. We never read it. Sometimes they will call us, and they will call</br>   me and be like, &quot;No, but this guy told me this.&quot; &quot;Did you read the terms</br>   and conditions?&quot; &quot;No, but he tells me this.&quot; &quot;I'm sorry, but you have to</br>   check the terms and conditions.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, what should I know about AT&amp;amp;T that I can be careful about?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Just pretty much check terms and conditions.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Which terms and conditions? Tell me what I should know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Everything. Pretty much all the time when customers call, it's</br>   because they have a higher bill, pretty much it’s for that. When you have a</br>   higher bill because you don't got a discount, because all of the things</br>   will be for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12 months</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">24 months</span>. They give you another discounts, out of</br>   your bill, every month. You're getting another contract right there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: When people call you up really angry—like they call up, and some</br>   people are really angry on the phone—what do you do with them? Do you put</br>   them on mute?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, sometimes you listen to them. The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> thing that you have</br>   to do—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You seem like such a calm person, so I'm asking you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: The first thing you will have to do is listen to them. Don't</br>   interrupt them. They don't want to hear what you have to tell them, so</br>   don't interrupt them. Let them talk. As soon as they finish, just be like,</br>   &quot;I'll be working on it. Let me check, let me repeat the information.&quot; They</br>   will calm down. As soon as they calm down, you will be like, &quot;Okay, I have</br>   to check what I can offer.&quot; If there is nothing you can offer, you will be</br>   like, &quot;Sorry, sir, there is nothing I can do, but this is what happened,&quot;</br>   and you're telling them everything. Why? Because he's – oh, that person is</br>   not going to yell at you because that person is now telling you everything.</br>   As soon as that point, when you can tell them, &quot;You know what? Your</br>   promotion is not available anymore.&quot; They will get upset –</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They'll accept it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, sometimes. Other people will get upset, and will think that</br>   a manager or a supervisor, they will ask right away for them. They will</br>   think that they're going to fix everything. But no, they are more specific</br>   on the terms and conditions because they go by the book. So, when an agent</br>   tries to do everything, it's because he's trying. But when you request a</br>   manager, and you're requesting something that agent can't do, you're going</br>   to be denied.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, it's better to stick with the agent?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah, sometimes. Or sometimes say, &quot;I want to cancel.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I want to cancel.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Ah, is that the best thing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah, because you will go to retention, and they will get the</br>   right skills. It's because every department, they have different skills.</br>   The retention, what are they trying to do? The department of cancellations,</br>   what are they going to do? They have all of the promotions that the</br>   customer is happy for. They never tell you that the promotions, they will</br>   probably hook you up with another contract. Even though you don't say</br>   anything, but by you saying you want another discount, &quot;Okay, don't worry,</br>   I'm going to provide you a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12-month</span> discount.&quot; You're hooked with that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So every time I call AT&amp;amp;T, they're always telling me, &quot;Can I</br>   tell you how we can give you a better ...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. But with them, you have a script. They have a script, and</br>   you will have to follow the script. So, the best point is, &quot;You know what?</br>   I want to cancel.&quot; You will go with the department, and they will try to do</br>   anything to keep you as a customer.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay. So, I'll never ask for a manager again.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No, don't do it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Just say I want to cancel. This is good. But do you ever put them on</br>   mute and not listen?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. Sometimes you have to put it on mute, so the customer can</br>   relax. There are some phones that you will have to let the client speak,</br>   even if you put it on mute, they will be like, &quot;No, I don't want you to go</br>   on mute.&quot; Or some people, &quot;Okay, take your time.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Tim</span>: So, I'm just wondering, does anyone ... I assume most of these calls</br>   are coming from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. Does anyone hear your accent and ever</br>   attack you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Oh yeah, all of the time. That's in every call center here. I</br>   mean, that happens all of the time, that when you talk to somebody, and</br>   they say, &quot;Oh, I don't want to talk to you. I want someone from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>.&quot; The only thing that you control is, &quot;You know what? I'll transfer</br>   you to the IVR—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: To the what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: The IVR. &quot;But I won't promise you-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's the IVR?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: When you call to customer service—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Tim</span>: An automated system.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. So that's when you will be like, &quot;You know what? Okay. I</br>   will transfer you to the IVR, but I won't promise you that you will be</br>   speaking with somebody from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>.&quot; They will get upset and</br>   they will hang up. Other than that, you will tell them, &quot;If you want to</br>   talk with someone from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, you will have to go to the local</br>   office to do the process because pretty much all of the call centers are</br>   ... I mean, I'm working, right now, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Alliance</span>, I don't do any phone calls. I</br>   don't receive phone calls, it's pretty much back office. It's kind of</br>   different. But it's better, I think. It's less pay, but it's better.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think that being in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, living there, that</br>   there are certain things that made you feel <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> in any way?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. Yeah. Because there is one thing, and I'm going to put it</br>   that way. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Thanksgiving</span>. Yeah. For me, Thanksgiving is like something that I</br>   had to do on my own. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span> of all, at my house, they were like, &quot;What's</br>   this? Why you do this?&quot; I go, &quot;It's because I thank God because I have food</br>   on the table.&quot; That's something that we do every year. There’s some points,</br>   football, like baseball, basketball, things like that, that over here, they</br>   don't see it that way. But <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Thanksgiving</span>, yes, it's something important.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, did you become an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> football fan?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Vikings</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. Well, pretty much, I'm not a fan for one team only. I like</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Vikings</span>, I like the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">49ers</span>, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Oakland</span> too—they have no difference to the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Raiders</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oakland</span>, because the only difference is that bridge. But yes,</br>   pretty much, I like a lot of teams that we used to do over there, that we</br>   don't do over here. But I see them doing it. From here, too, I've got some</br>   teams that I knew.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, what about in your way of thinking? Do you think that there is</br>   anything <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> that's different about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. Yes. I mean, it could be a lot of things. It would be the</br>   persons, the way I think.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Like what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Like you know, the way I think right here, sometimes people are</br>   really close. They don't see further than what <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> can see. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span></br>   can have liberty to do more things, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, they're all tight. They</br>   don't let you do things. That's the difference. For me, like with my son,</br>   he's, right now, he's going to graduate from primaria [elementary school].</br>   I let him go to sleep late. Some people, like my sisters, to their son,</br>   they don't see it that way. So that's something different. I let my son,</br>   with a cell phone. She's like, &quot;No, my son is not going to have a cell</br>   phone until he's older.&quot; That's a difference that we have.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: But I mean, I like it because I'm a single dad. I like to have</br>   communication with him, to be like, &quot;How are you? How is school?&quot; <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> of</br>   the things, I quit AT&amp;amp;T, that was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span>. It was far away from my house. I</br>   used to wake up at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">4:40 in the morning</span>. I used to be there before <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">seven</span>. I</br>   will get out <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">around six,</span> from AT&amp;amp;T, and I would be at home around, from</br>   eight to nine. That was from Monday to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Friday</span>. So, I didn't have time with</br>   my son. Now on the job that I have, I work from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">seven to three</span>. I work from</br>   Monday to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Friday</span>. So, it's pretty good. But my son will go alone to the</br>   school, where I will have to pay a taxi, but I will go to pick him up out</br>   of school. That's something that helps me. I'm not making a lot of money</br>   like I used to. But I'd rather be with my son.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Does your son consider himself <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> at all?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. Yes. He could be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, and he's completely the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   flag. He knows he's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, but he looks <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. If you will tell him,</br>   &quot;Yes, I am from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, but I'm from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, too.&quot; He will be</br>   like, &quot;<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot; This is funny, because sometimes, when we had the</br>   soccer games, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> versus <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>, we will be at home, and be like,</br>   &quot;A quien le vas?&quot; [who are you rooting for?] He will go, &quot;<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot; That's</br>   funny, because that's something that we would play with him because we</br>   would tell him, &quot;But you're not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. You have to go for the United</br>   States.&quot; He's like, &quot;No. I go for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot; But that's something—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who did you go for? Who did you root for?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I'm not really into it, to the soccer. Whatever wins. I'm not used</br>   to it, to soccer games. I'm more used to—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But if somebody asked you to that soccer game? Para quien le va?</br>   [who are you rooting for?]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Oh, I would be like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. Even over there, I mean ...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But I'm wondering, because your son came here so little, whether he</br>   might be more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> than you are in some ways.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Even though he's the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, and you're the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I know. That's something that I will tell him. My son doesn't</br>   speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. Some people will say to me, &quot;Why you don't teach him?&quot; I</br>   mean, I teach him some words. He knows, like I tell him, &quot;Do your bed.&quot; He</br>   knows what I'm telling him. But he doesn’t know how to pronounce it. Why?</br>   Because at school, they only speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. They don't have an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span></br>   class. He doesn't have nobody to talk <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> but me. I'm the only person.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: In his way of thinking, is he more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> in some ways than you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. Yes, even the way that he talks sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: The way that he talks, you said? Like what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: We call right here, we talk like Chilango, they have some</br>   different words. I'm from here, but I don't even talk that way. He talks</br>   that way. I'm like, &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mijo</span>, why you talk that way?&quot; I don't mind it, because</br>   he's a good boy. I'm not going to complain about him. Sometimes it's hard</br>   for me, because it's only me and him. Before, when he was a kid, I think he</br>   needed more of his mom. But now, we're getting there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How old was he when he came here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">One year</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">One year old</span>. Wow. So, he's an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizen?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Who came here because you were deported, and although he's an</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizen, he's growing up in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> — I mean, he's a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12-year-old</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. I mean, he pretty much, even on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Independence Day</span>—that's</br>   another thing that we celebrate here too. Him and me, on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">fourth of July</span>, we</br>   celebrate. We do something. Everybody is like, &quot;Why you do this?&quot; There is</br>   something that people don't know. It's like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Thanksgiving</span>, too. People don't</br>   know why we celebrate that. But we celebrate it, because for me, because I</br>   used to do that, and I want him to keep doing it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So why is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">July 4th</span> important to you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, we used to get all together, like family, and fireworks, and</br>   it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the long weekend</span>, so we would go swimming, we would go to the river.</br>   In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>, it was the river. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, it was to the ocean, to the</br>   sea, to the bay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you do hotdogs and stuff on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">July 4th</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No. Well, always, always, on Thanksgiving it was the turkey. On</br>   the side, they would make some <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> food. Same thing on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the Fourth of   July</span>. We would make some <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> food.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, let me ask you just one final question about the deportation.</br>   Could you have done your papers earlier?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: There was nothing you could have done?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: There was a period, because on the beginning, I had my interview,</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Ciudad Juarez</span>, but they asked me for a waiver. So, when they asked me</br>   for the waiver, I will have to reschedule another appointment. When that</br>   happens, she didn't really help me out anymore.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But when you were still in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, did you delay?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No. The processes, it takes too long. That's why they let me</br>   go—Immigration, when they got me, they let me go, because I was in the</br>   process for my papers. They told me to keep going to court.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you have any contact with your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Not at all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How old is she?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: She's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>. Not at all, her mom doesn't let her talk to me at all.</br>   Not even with my son. But I mean, life is good. What can I say? Before it</br>   was really hard, but now I'm used to it. I have to keep living with it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You sound like an amazing dad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I'm trying to. It's hard. Believe me. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">Two</span> years ago, my mom passed</br>   away. So, she was the one that used to help me a lot. But now it got a</br>   little bit harder, because now he's getting a little bit older, and he's</br>   getting older, and the problems start.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. You don't have a partner?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No. No, I'm single. [Laughs]. No, I mean, I used to have a</br>   girlfriend. But nothing else.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Thank you for sharing your story.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No, thank you to you. I wanted to talk. I mean, this is something</br>   that is like therapy, because it helps me. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Yesterday</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of my friends</br>   came, and she was like, &quot;You need this. You need to go.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And? How do you feel now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I like it. I like it a lot. It's something new. It's something</br>   that I'll let everything go at this moment.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You really sound like an incredible dad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Thank you. I appreciate it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: It's very, very moving.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I appreciate it. I've been here for a lot of time. It’s tough to</br>   be a dad sometimes. Sometimes there is things that I want to do, but I</br>   can't because I have to be at home.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You know, I've been hearing stories <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">all day long</span>, about kids who</br>   went, and their <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> dads abandoned them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No, that won't happen.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I'm ending my day – You are helping me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No, I mean—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You are giving me—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: One of the reasons that I will never do that, is because my dad,</br>   when he was in the states, he left me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Your dad did it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: He left me. From that, I was like, “No.” From that, I was like,</br>   &quot;No, I can't do that.&quot; I mean, I wouldn't do it. My son is my son, and</br>   he'll always be there.</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">June 8, 2019</span></br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. Okay. Has <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the last year</span> been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh. What's been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, first of all is because for some time I stayed without a</br>   job. Why? Because I was trying to ... For me to find a job is really hard</br>   because I had to be with him. At the same time, I had to take care of him</br>   from school, so for me it was really hard. So, I found a job, but it was</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">two hours and a half</span> from my house just to go. And to come back, it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">two   hours and a half</span>. It was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">almost four to five hours</span>, so I wouldn't have time</br>   for him. And not just to take him to the school, to help him to do</br>   homework. It's really hard. But I stayed without a job for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two months</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: So right now, I found a really good job. I mean, it's really good.</br>   I work from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Monday</span> to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Friday</span>. It's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">45 minutes</span> away from my house, so it's</br>   really good. And then I got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Saturdays</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Sundays</span> off.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What job?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: This is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">East Concourse Servicing</span>. It's just a call center, but</br>   it's a collision agency. I mean, it's pretty good. I wouldn't say, I don't</br>   make a lot of money, but I'm getting there. It's close to my house. I will</br>   be able to take him to school, and then he will have to go from school to</br>   the house by himself. But I know that he went to the school. I know he will</br>   be there, and I got time for him because I only work <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">nine hours</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You work <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">nine hours</span> per day?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. From Monday to Friday.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What are you being paid?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, right now, the gross pay is $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">8,000</span>. I mean, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">8,000 pesos</span>. I'm</br>   sorry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">8,000 pesos</span> for ...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Per month. Plus with that you have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">2,000 pesos</span> in vales de</br>   despensa, that’s what they call the food vouchers they give you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Plus <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">2,000</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>:</br> </br> </br>   Per month. Plus a bonus that we could get. We could get from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">2,000</span> probably</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">4,000</span> more. All depends. And I mean, it's pretty good because I</br>   got time to spend with him on the weekends. He's getting older already. I</br>   mean, he's not a boy anymore. He's growing up, so I have to take care of</br>   more of him. I have to be more time with him.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Are you worried about him?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What are you worried about?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: About everything. I mean, to be really honest with you, I don't</br>   know, but if you go to one school from here from Mexico-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>:</br> </br> </br>   I'm worried because sometimes you never know what could happen. Sometimes</br>   they could go to the ... On the way to the school, there's a lot of danger</br>   sometimes, even to cross the avenues. Some people, there's a lot of bad</br>   people around here, too, sometimes, no? So that's why I'm worried. That's</br>   why I'm always trying to get a good job, to have the money so we could</br>   survive. At the same time, so I could be able to be with him, too, when he</br>   needs. Right now, it takes me time, but the job that I have, it gives me</br>   the opportunity to do a lot of things with him. So that's what I want, and</br>   I want to stay with that job for a while. I mean, it's really good. I don't</br>   make as much money as before, but I will be able to be at home to cook for</br>   him, to do things with him. So that's something that I really wanted to do</br>   because it's only him and me. If we don't take care of each other, who's</br>   going to take care of us?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And do you ever think about him going back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Last week</span> ... I have another daughter.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yes. I remember.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I don't know if you ever remember that I told you. She's going to</br>   be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17</span> already <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next year</span>, so she didn't talk to me at all before. She</br>   started talking to me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">last Sunday</span>. She was like, &quot;You know what? I want to</br>   go and visit you guys.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Great.&quot; Well, I was happy. It’s</br>   something that I would never expect. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span> of all, I never expect that</br>   phone call at all. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">Second</span> of all, when she says, &quot;Well, I want to see you</br>   guys,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;I want to see you, too, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mija</span>, but we had to wait for</br>   you to get the passport and everything.&quot; I know it's going to be a process</br>   and you know everything will cost money, but I will make it. Probably <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next   year</span>, she will be here, at least for a couple weeks, no?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: But, yes, I want him to get the passport and everything so he can</br>   go, too. Later on, I want to see if I could get my visa, just to go and</br>   visit them or just to take him to visit and so he will be able to know his</br>   country. Because, believe it or not, he wants to go and see. Sometimes he,</br>   like in the school, sometimes he gets racismo. I don't like it. I want him</br>   to go over there, too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: He gets racism because?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Because he was born over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But how do they know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: In the school and by the teacher, by one teacher.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But how do they know? He doesn't speak a word of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I know but everybody around there knows him. They know who he is,</br>   and they know me, too, and they're like, &quot;Well, he was born over there, but</br>   he doesn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. But he's born over there. “Es el gringo.&quot; [he’s</br>   the gringo] I mean, that's how they tell him.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And what does he answer back? What do you answer?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: [to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>] Cuando te dicen el gringo en la escuela o el maestro</br>   que te decia, que decias? [when they call you the gringo in school what do</br>   you say?]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>: [inaudible]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Pero que le decias? Es la pregunta. [what do you say? that’s the</br>   question]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>: [inaudible]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: He's always shy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I know. Except when he's dancing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I know. [laughs]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But what is he saying? What does he tell you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: On the beginning, he got upset because we talk about it. I was</br>   like, &quot;You know what? If you want me, I will go and talk with that teacher</br>   to stop the bullying,&quot; because he's pretty much that. But he getting to</br>   swear me he doesn't care. He's like from here. He just, you know, nothing</br>   changes. It’s just like normal because he's been raised in here for almost</br>   all his life.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So how did your daughter get in touch with yeah?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: By her grandma. I had her grandma in Facebook, and we talk</br>   sometimes, and she got ahold of me by phone. I was like, &quot;Great.&quot; I mean,</br>   it was for a long time that she wouldn't get in touch with me. She didn't</br>   even try to talk to me, and now she did. I'm like, &quot;Well, this is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> step,</br>   no, towards –.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your friends with her grandma, which is your ex-wife's mother, on</br>   Facebook?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I get along with them, except with the mom. I get along with both</br>   sisters, with both brothers, and with the grandma. I mean, we get along,</br>   but with her, we don't get in touch at all. I mean, she doesn't want to</br>   talk to me, and I mean, that's fine because she's already with somebody</br>   else. I respect that. Plus, I don't want to know anything about it either.</br>   But there's something, she don't want… It's because she doesn't want... She</br>   will want it. She will be like, &quot;You know what? I pay for the passport. She</br>   pays for this. We do this. We do that.&quot; So, he will be able to go over</br>   there, and my daughter will be able to come over there. We could be</br>   connected, but she doesn’t want to do that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: She doesn't want to? But is she going to allow her daughter to come</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, that's the thing that we were planning. I mean, I was</br>   telling my daughter, &quot;Right now, I wish I could have the money to be like,</br>   'You know what? I'll send you for the passport. And I have the plane</br>   ticket.'&quot; But it's a process. I mean, I don't want to put things on the</br>   hurry. I want just to be little by little. Probably if not by when she will</br>   be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>, it will be different. Right now, this is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> step. I know in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span></br>   time she will be able to come and is sooner than before.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: When was the last time you saw her?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Oh, yeah. It has <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">11 years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: It's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">11 years</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: It's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">11 years</span>, and I want to see her already. I mean, I want</br>   to see her. I know she needs me, and I need her, too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you spoken on FaceTime?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you see each other?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. But, I mean, it's not the same. I wish it would be like I</br>   could have her here right here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. Does she look like you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: I will show you a picture right now. Let me see. Hold on. Let me</br>   see.

She really does.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah, and she's the big one. She's right now <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">16</span>. She's going to be</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow. Well, that's great. So she Facebooked you once?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah, I mean-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: All of a sudden you got a message on Facebook?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Saying, &quot;Hi, this is <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Natalie</span>&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: &quot;Hi, Dad. This is <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Natalie</span>.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Hi. How you doing? It</br>   was great to get to know you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: It must have been.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. It was good. I mean, I wasn't – On <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Sunday</span>, we were just</br>   watching TV, and then I just see my cellphone, and it says, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; And</br>   I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; Then I was like, &quot;Hey, how you doing, and how you been?&quot;</br>   And that's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Pretending for it not to be a big deal, but of course.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah, and it was good. I mean, because I know her mom wasn't</br>   around, so she will be able to talk to me to tell me more things. Because</br>   on the last times when I talked to her, it was like, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; &quot;How you</br>   doing?&quot; &quot;Oh, hi. How are you?” “Bye.&quot; That's it. She wouldn't be able to</br>   tell me, &quot;Hey, this is what's happening over here. I miss you. I want to</br>   go,&quot; or something like that. It's a good start.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But she said those things?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. Now, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And has she talked to [gestures to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. [to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>] ¿Si, verdad que hablaste con <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Natalie</span> también?</br>   [you talked to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Natalie</span> too, right?]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>: ¿Que?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: [to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>] ¿Hablaste con <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Natalie</span>? [you talked to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Natalie</span>?] [to</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>] I mean, but the difference between them is that we have one issue.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Language.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: He doesn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, and she doesn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. So, I</br>   mean, he may understand a little bit, but some words and something. It's</br>   all the same thing. She may know some <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and words, but that's it. So,</br>   it's kind of strange. I mean, she doesn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, and he doesn't</br>   speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Which is crazy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: And it happens. I mean, but we're fine, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Well, that's fantastic news. I'm just going to ask you. The most</br>   difficult challenges you faced <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this year</span> was finding a job?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Losing my job and finding a job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. Over <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the years</span>, things have gotten better, though?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, yeah. I mean, yes. The only thing is that when you don't</br>   have a job, that's a little bit hard. But then when you start working, you</br>   start getting on your feet. You start on the track again, but we're getting</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you know about programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Not really. No, because even right here if you check, they have</br>   help for madres solteras, [single mothers] but it won't happen to me</br>   because I'm a single dad. I won't qualify for that. I mean, sometimes it</br>   will be great just because you will get benefits like programs where they</br>   can go and do some sports or something like that. But I don't apply, and he</br>   won't apply either because he's not from here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, let me just finish this. We ask which of your relatives live in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: My brother and my sister.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay. Siblings. Are you in touch with them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: We live together.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh, so you live with your brother and sister?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: We live together in the same house. Like everybody has his own</br>   part, but I mean, everybody – they have to go to work. They have their own</br>   families, so sometimes, even though they help you out and we help each</br>   other, but sometimes you have to do things because they got other things to</br>   do, too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Would you consider going back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Because I grew up over there, and to be honest with you, I miss a</br>   lot over there. I know I could do more things over there than over here,</br>   but you know one of the things that I don't want to go illegally, not</br>   anymore. I mean, I want to go legally, and I know it may take some time.</br>   But I could do it because my son and my daughter, they're from over there.</br>   They will be able to get my papers fixed. When that happens, I want to be</br>   able to go legally, and I want to go to work, do some things. Like how it</br>   was my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> dream back when I was over there. Right here, I won't say</br>   that. At the beginning, when I got here, I didn't know nobody. It was</br>   really hard. I got in depression and a lot of things, but now, I mean, I'm</br>   living day by day, and I have to like it. I'm okay now. But, yes, I will go</br>   back one day. But I want to go legally, not illegal.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> question is do you think that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> government has</br>   responsibility for <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: In some parts, I think, but they won't do anything. I mean, to be</br>   really honest with you, they never going to do anything because they have</br>   so many people over there. It's not just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>. It's not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. It's</br>   everybody. It's all the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latin</span> people, all the people from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Europe</span> or from</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Africa</span>. There's a lot of immigrants from over there, and they, some of</br>   them, they already born over there. So, they're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>, too. They don't</br>   even receive help.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But what about <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span> being here. What kind of responsibilities –</br>   What do you think the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> government should do to help <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roddy</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Well, what I would like is probably just to help him with medical.</br>   That would be all. I mean, because over there, they give you that – How's</br>   it called? That program that they give you meals and all that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: And they give you benefits. Well, for that, I mean, I work for it,</br>   and we used to pay our own things with your own work. But, I mean, I</br>   wouldn't ask for money. The only thing that I would ask is for medical</br>   assistance for him.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What about for his school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: And schooling. Yeah. And that's one of the things, too, because on</br>   the future, one of the things that I want him sooner or later for him to go</br>   back is because I want him to go to school over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: He's got to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: Yeah. So right now, my goal up to this point is I want him to go</br>   to an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> school, and that's my new goal. I won't be able to do it in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this month</span>, but probably <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next month</span>, he will start doing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. And not</br>   because I don't want to. It's because we need money to do all the process,</br>   too. I'm starting my track and probably not this paycheck, I can’t do it,</br>   but <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next paycheck</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next month</span>, I will be able to do it. And that's</br>   something that I really want to do because, to be really honest, I probably</br>   just want to stay probably right here <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one or two years more</span>, and he may go</br>   back. That's something that I have. I want him to go to high school over</br>   there, just out of high school to go to college, so he could start the</br>   school over there already.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And would his mother – could he live with his mother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodrigo</span>: No. No. I grew up in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, and I got a lot of aunts for my</br>   mom's side. So, they will be able to take care of him, and plus, that's my</br>   other goal, too. For <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next years</span>, I want to try to apply for my visa. I</br>   mean, I don't have no bad records at all over there. I didn't do anything</br>   wrong over there. I came over here to fix my papers. I have everything, but</br>   it didn't happen. So, I never tried to come back illegally, so I want to go</br>   and try to get my visa. If I get it, good. If not, I'm just going to wait</br>   for him to get my papers fixed. So that's my dream. I wish it will be done,</br>   but we will try.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Those are great dreams. That's great dreams. Let me stop now.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
