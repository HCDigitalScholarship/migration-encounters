   what I wanted to hear about.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, pretty much, it was something different. I mean, you are<br>
   used to be right here in Mexico, where I was used to being right here in<br>
   Mexico. To go over there, to see different people, pretty much, the<br>
   differences, how people speak, because it was really different. I didn't<br>
   know anything about English. We were like, &quot;What are they talking about?&quot;<br>
   We were like, &quot;What?&quot; That's the only word I knew. But it was pretty much<br>
   good. But at first it was like even the TV, the news, everything was<br>
   different. I was a kid. I mean, the way you see, I was a kid and it was<br>
   really different. I tried to play with the other kids, but they couldn’t<br>
   speak Spanish, and I couldn’t speak English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Where did you arrive?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: First of all, I arrived in Texas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. Is that where you lived first?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, I just arrived in Texas. From there, I went to Minnesota.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Minnesota. Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: It was far away from Texas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Minnesota for a while?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, first of all, let me explain to you how it was. I cross the</br>   border, and I went to Texas first. From Texas, my aunts, they went from</br>   Minnesota to Texas, to pick me up. From there, I went to Minnesota. It was</br>   close by Canada. So, from there, it was pretty much, &quot;Oh my God, there is a</br>   lot of white people.&quot; So, it was hard for me to talk to anybody. When I</br>   went, first of all, I did like five days to stay at home, to get clothes</br>   because pretty much, we didn't have any clothes. So, first of all, we have</br>   to get clothes, get used to it. Then from there, we went to the school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, so I have questions for you. What month was it?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That was in April.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, was it still cold? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. I still see a lot of snow at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the first time you saw snow?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. One time I was right here, by ___, that was the first time</br>   that I see a lot of snow. Then I went to the school, and it was really,</br>   really hard for me because I couldn't say, &quot;May I go to the restroom?&quot; I</br>   couldn't check anything. The first day for me was horrible. Because I</br>   didn't know English. I didn't know anybody. I was a really different person</br>   than the students from there. They just looked at me like, &quot;Who are you?&quot;</br>   Some people would talk to me, and I was like [gestures] with signs. Then</br>   they put me with a tutor. It was just pretty much, all the year, I stayed</br>   with the tutor all the time, just learning English.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tutor nice?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I still remember she was nice to me. Then from there, I</br>   pretty much, I didn't learn a lot, but I learned how to ask for food, to go</br>   to the restroom. Small things. That was in the beginning. Then from</br>   there—that was in 8th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: 8th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because when I started over there, I was in 8th grade. Then from</br>   there, I moved to my aunt’s because my dad left me over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, your dad took you over?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He took me over, but then he left me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he go?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: To Texas. And then he went to Texas, and from there, we haven't</br>   talked since then.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You haven't talked until today, with your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Until today, I haven't. He found somebody else, and he got</br>   married, I guess. He just forgot about me. So, I started living with my</br>   mom's side of the family, with my aunts, and my grandma and grandpa. They</br>   would help me a lot. Then from there, from Minnesota, they wanted to move</br>   to California. So we moved to California. I started high school, 9th grade</br>   to 12th grade, in California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I don't know if you know the Central Valley area. It's a small</br>   town, it's called _________, California. Pretty much all of my family lives</br>   there, and around there. My mom had a big family. There were like 13</br>   brothers in total. So, it was a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So why Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because they live over there. To be honest with you, one of the</br>   reasons that now I get it is because in Minnesota, they didn't have a lot</br>   of Hispanic people. So, when you apply over there to get an</br>   immigration—because my aunts, they were trying to get the residential for</br>   my uncles, for their husbands—it was more faster for them to do it over</br>   there. So, they moved over there. Then they started buying houses. That's</br>   why we stayed there, for a while. Then they come back to California when</br>   they get their papers, and some of my uncles, they stay in Minnesota, and</br>   some, they stay in California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So, was California better than Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much, yes, and no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I have to be honest with you, in California, there were more Latin</br>   people, more Hispanic people, more Mexicans. I will say that, where we</br>   live. It was easier for me because they have more programs on the high</br>   school to learn English. We have the ESL, ESL one, ESL two, ESL three. That</br>   helped me a lot. It was better because I was used to being always at home</br>   back in Minnesota, and over here, not, because it was more sunny. It was</br>   better. It was more familiar with Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how many years were you in Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's another story. I stayed in Minnesota for six, nine months</br>   in the beginning. Then I moved to California, and as soon as I finished the</br>   high school, I moved to Minnesota again.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you move back to Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because I finished high school, and I couldn't go to the college,</br>   because I didn't have a social security number. So, I didn't have a way to</br>   keep studying. I had to work. The only work that they have over there, it</br>   was pretty much for people that don't have papers, was the fields. I didn't</br>   have a way to – a car or something to move.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the fields at all?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. On the summer. Summer I used to work on the fields, just two</br>   or three weeks, just to get some money to buy my clothes for the new year.</br>   So that's what I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what did you do in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Picking onions, and the cotton.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Cotton?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In the Central Valley?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: In the Central Valley area. That's what I did. It was not a lot. I</br>   didn't work, like I say. I used to work for three weeks, and then from</br>   there, I would be at home. Just to get some money to buy my clothes for the</br>   new year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, when you worked in the fields, you worked with other Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who were working full-time?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was that? Did they say, &quot;You lucky kid, you're going to school?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. Pretty much, I used to work with my aunts. One of my aunts,</br>   the one that raised me, she would go with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She worked in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. She would go with me, and she would take a look at me, keep</br>   an eye on me, just so nothing happens, because, you know, the border patrol</br>   and immigration would go in the fields. So, she always was there for me.</br>   She's like the main [inaudible].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year is this in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm talking about '98 to 2001.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, your aunts really wanted you to finish school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Pretty much, I grew up with them. My mom was here in Mexico.</br>   But pretty much, they helped me a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did they have children of their own?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yes, my cousins, my little cousins. They're not little</br>   anymore. I'm like the big brother for them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much older were you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I was 15 when I moved to California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. They were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: They were like five, three, two. They were not old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In California, were your friends mainly Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. First of all, it was Mexicans. Then when I started getting to</br>   know them a little bit more, and then started speaking more English, then I</br>   started getting Mexicans that were born there, they’re called Chicanos.</br>   Other Mexicans. Pretty much, it was Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any friends that weren't Chicano or Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much in the beginning it was Mexicans. Then after that, it</br>   was more Chicanos too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about others?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not really. Not in California. It's because pretty much all of the</br>   people are Mexican or Chicano. You could find some other kinds of people,</br>   but that's ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about school? Were there other kind of people at school? Or was</br>   everybody at school Mexican or Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, I mean, it was ... How can I say it? Because I didn't know</br>   enough English. They would put you aside. Not aside, but they would put</br>   you, &quot;Okay, you don't talk English, you have to go to ESL class.&quot; &quot;Okay,</br>   you're American, you're fine, you went to English class.&quot; It was different</br>   because all of the Mexicans, that we didn't know English, we were all in</br>   the same classes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about Central Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I didn't have that many right there in California. It was probably</br>   a field thing, from Guatemala. It was probably a few, like five, it wasn't</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, so you couldn't find a job that wouldn't have been in the</br>   fields after finishing high school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: After finishing high school. Then from there, I moved back to</br>   Minnesota. In Minnesota, that's when I started working in a fiberglass</br>   company. We used to make snowmobiles, all of that kind of parts. Even the</br>   front end from the buses, they are made from fiberglass. Even parts for</br>   airplanes. We used to make them, because they're made of fiberglass. That's</br>   where I knew more English. That's when I started getting along with white</br>   people. Right there, I met more Central American people. That was more</br>   different, because over there, there is not a lot of Mexicans. So that's</br>   where I learned more skills in English. At the same time, how they lived.</br>   White people, how they lived, black people, how they lived. We will see a</br>   few black people there. But we will see Indian people, how they lived.</br>   Bosnian people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was different about the way that the white people lived to the</br>   way the Mexicans lived?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, pretty much it depends on the persons because you could find</br>   a racist person, or you could find a person that tried to be a Mexican—or</br>   not to be a Mexican but get someone with Mexicans. That's when you compared</br>   those persons. Because some people, they don't care, they just see you, and</br>   some persons, they want to know how you lived, how everything goes. Some</br>   persons, they don't even care about you. When that happens, I got to know a</br>   lot of American people. We used to get along. I will say that they were my</br>   best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. At that point, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to Mexican restaurants? What did you do with them? How</br>   did you hang out with these people?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much, they were from work. On the weekends, we didn't work</br>   on Saturday and Sunday. So sometimes they would show up at the house, and</br>   we will cook out. Even sometimes the weather wouldn't let us, we would</br>   cookout in the garage. That's something that we would do.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you cook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. I mean, even they tried carnitas, carne asada.</br>   [grilled meat] I don’t know if you know tripa [intestine]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. They tried tripa?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. One of my best friends, he loves guacamole. It was something</br>   new for them at that time because it was like nobody knew that guacamole</br>   was avocado. It was something new for them. He would love that. He would</br>   always be like, &quot;I brought some chips, you make the guacamole.&quot; He will</br>   show up at the house, and we will make it. He would get along with my</br>   aunts, with my uncles. He was like a part of the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food did he cook for you? Did they cook for you too?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They just wanted Mexican food.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. His food was pizza, that was all. Pizzas and hamburgers.</br>   Sometimes we would be like, &quot;Let's go out to eat.&quot; &quot;Yeah, let's go.&quot; He</br>   would go, &quot;No, I want some pizza. I want some hamburgers.&quot; I would be like,</br>   &quot;Let's go to my house, let's see what thing we can make.&quot; One thing he</br>   would love, it was tinga. I don't know if you know—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes, I know what tinga is. My favorite tacos.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. We would make it—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: With chicken?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, with chicken, and onions, and chipotle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's very good. Did you ever go in a snowmobile while you were</br>   there?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, I went on the snowmobile, ice fishing. We would go to</br>   the rivers, and sometimes, especially over there, the ice would be this</br>   much. So, you could close the river and everything. We would go in a</br>   snowmobile. Where I used to work, we made something that is called a</br>   SnoBear. That's like for people that like to go snowmobile, or to go ice</br>   fishing. Sorry. So you got six holes, three in this side, and three in the</br>   other side. You would have a seat for each one. Then you would just go ice</br>   fishing right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you would sit on the ice through a hole?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But it wasn't like a big snowmobile. It's called a SnoBear.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, I see. So they were special snowmobiles to go fishing?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. It would be like a van, and you will have the special thing</br>   like a snowmobile, and you will have three holes right here, but you would</br>   have the seat by the three holes, and three over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see. Did you get used to the cold then?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes, I got used to it. I mean, I lived there for a while. I lived</br>   there for three or four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, there were there other Mexicans who went snowmobiling and did</br>   all of this?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, pretty much it was Mexicans, Americans, because we would get</br>   along. Yeah, we would go. Even in, I still got friends from over there,</br>   they still go ice fishing, and they send me pictures still.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you stayed there for three years?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, from California, I stayed there three years. Then I came</br>   back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I went to work—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: At the fiberglass factory?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I get off from work, and I would have to drive around 45</br>   minutes. I got stopped by the stop sign, for the light, for the back-up</br>   light. It was a sheriff, and he just asked for the driver's license. I have</br>   only the permit license. So, he asked me for if I was a resident, if I</br>   could show any proof. I was honest with him. &quot;No, I'm not.&quot; So, he right</br>   away called Border Patrol.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year is this?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That was I think 2002? But from then, I already had a daughter</br>   right there. I was married.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were married to a Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: To a Chicana.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't get residency?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's another story. [laughs]. No, from there I got deported.</br>   They called Border Patrol. From Border Patrol, they told me that they will</br>   let me go, but I will have to go to court because I already had a daughter,</br>   and I was married, and I had a baby coming. So, from there, I went to court</br>   and everything. But when I went to court, they deported me. So, they gave</br>   me some time to come back to Mexico. So that's been, already, 11 years.</br>   They gave me papers, so I have to come back over here. I came back with my</br>   daughter, because my son, he was only three months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about your wife?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: She stayed over there. But we already made the papers, so we could</br>   fix the residence. But from then, I came over here, and this is a sad</br>   story. I came over here with my daughter, and she was with my son over</br>   there. She came over here, but she was pregnant from somebody else.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. So, from there, she came over here, we tried to fix things.</br>   It didn't work out. I mean, it worked out for a little bit. She went back</br>   to have the baby, and she took my daughter, and she left me my son. So, she</br>   left, and she had the baby, and from there, she didn't fix my papers</br>   anymore. I stayed with my son right here. Right now, I'm a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You're a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. My son is from over there, he's already 11 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He's living with you? He's an American.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He's an American. He's living with me. He lives right here; he</br>   goes to school right here. He's going to turn 12 years old next month. I</br>   can't take him back because he doesn't know his mom, and he doesn't want to</br>   know nothing about his mom. He wants to go back with my aunts, but it's</br>   kind of hard. He doesn't want to let me go. I want him to go over there,</br>   but he doesn't want to go without me, and I'm not going back without my</br>   papers. Illegally, I'm not going back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like for you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: It was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was hard?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. Because I didn't know my mom, because I left for so</br>   much time. I didn't know my brother and my sister because they never went</br>   over there. I came over here, I couldn't find a job. I didn't know how to</br>   work right here. It was everything different for us. Plus, because we had</br>   tattoos, they were kind of racist, like in the face. Because you got a</br>   tattoo, you cannot get a job. Then it was hard for me to find a job,</br>   because first of all, I didn't have all of my papers, like the security</br>   number that we have right here. So, I started working in a restaurant. From</br>   there, I started looking for other jobs. From there, I started working in a</br>   gas station. Whatever I will put the gas, and whatever they will give me,</br>   that's it. That would be what I get.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's it?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's it. Plus, I will have to pay to the gas station for me</br>   working there. Yeah. When you go right here, and you see the gas stations,</br>   the people that work there, they only work for the tips. They will have to</br>   still pay for that, to the gas station, to be working there. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Then from there, I met this person, on the metro. And I found</br>   TeleTech. I started working there. I worked for three years. I started at</br>   zero, by nothing. I didn't know anything about call centers. From there, I</br>   went to [inaudible] for nine months. From there, I stayed there for three</br>   years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What company do you work for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Right now, I started working for Alliance.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The insurance company?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The insurance company. I got like three weeks that I started</br>   there. But before that, I worked at AT&amp;amp;T.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I haven't started working. I worked three years for</br>   TeleTech. As soon as I finished with TeleTech, I went to AT&amp;amp;T. I was</br>   already hired, and then I quit over here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how long were you with AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: A year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did customer service for AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Customer service. I assume. I worked—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's my phone company.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Good luck. [laughs]. I mean, it's pretty good. As long as you know</br>   the terms and conditions, which we don't really read that much. That's what</br>   happens. We never read it. Sometimes they will call us, and they will call</br>   me and be like, &quot;No, but this guy told me this.&quot; &quot;Did you read the terms</br>   and conditions?&quot; &quot;No, but he tells me this.&quot; &quot;I'm sorry, but you have to</br>   check the terms and conditions.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what should I know about AT&amp;amp;T that I can be careful about?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Just pretty much check terms and conditions.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which terms and conditions? Tell me what I should know.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. Pretty much all the time when customers call, it's</br>   because they have a higher bill, pretty much it’s for that. When you have a</br>   higher bill because you don't got a discount, because all of the things</br>   will be for 12 months or 24 months. They give you another discounts, out of</br>   your bill, every month. You're getting another contract right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When people call you up really angry—like they call up, and some</br>   people are really angry on the phone—what do you do with them? Do you put</br>   them on mute?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, sometimes you listen to them. The first thing that you have</br>   to do—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You seem like such a calm person, so I'm asking you.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The first thing you will have to do is listen to them. Don't</br>   interrupt them. They don't want to hear what you have to tell them, so</br>   don't interrupt them. Let them talk. As soon as they finish, just be like,</br>   &quot;I'll be working on it. Let me check, let me repeat the information.&quot; They</br>   will calm down. As soon as they calm down, you will be like, &quot;Okay, I have</br>   to check what I can offer.&quot; If there is nothing you can offer, you will be</br>   like, &quot;Sorry, sir, there is nothing I can do, but this is what happened,&quot;</br>   and you're telling them everything. Why? Because he's – oh, that person is</br>   not going to yell at you because that person is now telling you everything.</br>   As soon as that point, when you can tell them, &quot;You know what? Your</br>   promotion is not available anymore.&quot; They will get upset –</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They'll accept it?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, sometimes. Other people will get upset, and will think that</br>   a manager or a supervisor, they will ask right away for them. They will</br>   think that they're going to fix everything. But no, they are more specific</br>   on the terms and conditions because they go by the book. So, when an agent</br>   tries to do everything, it's because he's trying. But when you request a</br>   manager, and you're requesting something that agent can't do, you're going</br>   to be denied.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it's better to stick with the agent?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, sometimes. Or sometimes say, &quot;I want to cancel.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I want to cancel.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Ah, is that the best thing?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, because you will go to retention, and they will get the</br>   right skills. It's because every department, they have different skills.</br>   The retention, what are they trying to do? The department of cancellations,</br>   what are they going to do? They have all of the promotions that the</br>   customer is happy for. They never tell you that the promotions, they will</br>   probably hook you up with another contract. Even though you don't say</br>   anything, but by you saying you want another discount, &quot;Okay, don't worry,</br>   I'm going to provide you a 12-month discount.&quot; You're hooked with that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So every time I call AT&amp;amp;T, they're always telling me, &quot;Can I</br>   tell you how we can give you a better ...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But with them, you have a script. They have a script, and</br>   you will have to follow the script. So, the best point is, &quot;You know what?</br>   I want to cancel.&quot; You will go with the department, and they will try to do</br>   anything to keep you as a customer.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. So, I'll never ask for a manager again.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, don't do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just say I want to cancel. This is good. But do you ever put them on</br>   mute and not listen?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Sometimes you have to put it on mute, so the customer can</br>   relax. There are some phones that you will have to let the client speak,</br>   even if you put it on mute, they will be like, &quot;No, I don't want you to go</br>   on mute.&quot; Or some people, &quot;Okay, take your time.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, I'm just wondering, does anyone ... I assume most of these calls</br>   are coming from the United States. Does anyone hear your accent and ever</br>   attack you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh yeah, all of the time. That's in every call center here. I</br>   mean, that happens all of the time, that when you talk to somebody, and</br>   they say, &quot;Oh, I don't want to talk to you. I want someone from the United</br>   States.&quot; The only thing that you control is, &quot;You know what? I'll transfer</br>   you to the IVR—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: To the what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The IVR. &quot;But I won't promise you-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the IVR?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: When you call to customer service—</br> </br> </br>   Tim: An automated system.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. So that's when you will be like, &quot;You know what? Okay. I</br>   will transfer you to the IVR, but I won't promise you that you will be</br>   speaking with somebody from the United States.&quot; They will get upset and</br>   they will hang up. Other than that, you will tell them, &quot;If you want to</br>   talk with someone from the United States, you will have to go to the local</br>   office to do the process because pretty much all of the call centers are</br>   ... I mean, I'm working, right now, Alliance, I don't do any phone calls. I</br>   don't receive phone calls, it's pretty much back office. It's kind of</br>   different. But it's better, I think. It's less pay, but it's better.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that being in the United States, living there, that</br>   there are certain things that made you feel American in any way?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. Because there is one thing, and I'm going to put it</br>   that way. Thanksgiving. Yeah. For me, Thanksgiving is like something that I</br>   had to do on my own. First of all, at my house, they were like, &quot;What's</br>   this? Why you do this?&quot; I go, &quot;It's because I thank God because I have food</br>   on the table.&quot; That's something that we do every year. There’s some points,</br>   football, like baseball, basketball, things like that, that over here, they</br>   don't see it that way. But Thanksgiving, yes, it's something important.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did you become an American football fan?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The Vikings?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Well, pretty much, I'm not a fan for one team only. I like</br>   Vikings, I like the 49ers, and Oakland too—they have no difference to the</br>   Raiders in Oakland, because the only difference is that bridge. But yes,</br>   pretty much, I like a lot of teams that we used to do over there, that we</br>   don't do over here. But I see them doing it. From here, too, I've got some</br>   teams that I knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what about in your way of thinking? Do you think that there is</br>   anything American that's different about Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. I mean, it could be a lot of things. It would be the</br>   persons, the way I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Like you know, the way I think right here, sometimes people are</br>   really close. They don't see further than what Americans can see. Americans</br>   can have liberty to do more things, and Mexicans, they're all tight. They</br>   don't let you do things. That's the difference. For me, like with my son,</br>   he's, right now, he's going to graduate from primaria [elementary school].</br>   I let him go to sleep late. Some people, like my sisters, to their son,</br>   they don't see it that way. So that's something different. I let my son,</br>   with a cell phone. She's like, &quot;No, my son is not going to have a cell</br>   phone until he's older.&quot; That's a difference that we have.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: But I mean, I like it because I'm a single dad. I like to have</br>   communication with him, to be like, &quot;How are you? How is school?&quot; One of</br>   the things, I quit AT&amp;amp;T, that was one. It was far away from my house. I</br>   used to wake up at 4:40 in the morning. I used to be there before seven. I</br>   will get out around six, from AT&amp;amp;T, and I would be at home around, from</br>   eight to nine. That was from Monday to Friday. So, I didn't have time with</br>   my son. Now on the job that I have, I work from seven to three. I work from</br>   Monday to Friday. So, it's pretty good. But my son will go alone to the</br>   school, where I will have to pay a taxi, but I will go to pick him up out</br>   of school. That's something that helps me. I'm not making a lot of money</br>   like I used to. But I'd rather be with my son.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Does your son consider himself Mexican at all?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. He could be one Mexican, and he's completely the Mexican</br>   flag. He knows he's American, but he looks Mexican. If you will tell him,</br>   &quot;Yes, I am from the United States, but I'm from Mexico, too.&quot; He will be</br>   like, &quot;Mexico, Mexico.&quot; This is funny, because sometimes, when we had the</br>   soccer games, Mexico versus United States, we will be at home, and be like,</br>   &quot;A quien le vas?&quot; [who are you rooting for?] He will go, &quot;Mexico.&quot; That's</br>   funny, because that's something that we would play with him because we</br>   would tell him, &quot;But you're not Mexican. You have to go for the United</br>   States.&quot; He's like, &quot;No. I go for Mexico.&quot; But that's something—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who did you go for? Who did you root for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm not really into it, to the soccer. Whatever wins. I'm not used</br>   to it, to soccer games. I'm more used to—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But if somebody asked you to that soccer game? Para quien le va?</br>   [who are you rooting for?]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh, I would be like Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Even over there, I mean ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But I'm wondering, because your son came here so little, whether he</br>   might be more Mexican than you are in some ways.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Even though he's the American, and you're the Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know. That's something that I will tell him. My son doesn't</br>   speak English. Some people will say to me, &quot;Why you don't teach him?&quot; I</br>   mean, I teach him some words. He knows, like I tell him, &quot;Do your bed.&quot; He</br>   knows what I'm telling him. But he doesn’t know how to pronounce it. Why?</br>   Because at school, they only speak Spanish. They don't have an English</br>   class. He doesn't have nobody to talk English but me. I'm the only person.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In his way of thinking, is he more Mexican in some ways than you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, even the way that he talks sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The way that he talks, you said? Like what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We call right here, we talk like Chilango, they have some</br>   different words. I'm from here, but I don't even talk that way. He talks</br>   that way. I'm like, &quot;Mijo, why you talk that way?&quot; I don't mind it, because</br>   he's a good boy. I'm not going to complain about him. Sometimes it's hard</br>   for me, because it's only me and him. Before, when he was a kid, I think he</br>   needed more of his mom. But now, we're getting there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old was he when he came here?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: One year old. Wow. So, he's an American citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who came here because you were deported, and although he's an</br>   American citizen, he's growing up in Mexico — I mean, he's a Mexican</br>   12-year-old.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. I mean, he pretty much, even on Independence Day—that's</br>   another thing that we celebrate here too. Him and me, on fourth of July, we</br>   celebrate. We do something. Everybody is like, &quot;Why you do this?&quot; There is</br>   something that people don't know. It's like Thanksgiving, too. People don't</br>   know why we celebrate that. But we celebrate it, because for me, because I</br>   used to do that, and I want him to keep doing it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So why is July 4th important to you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, we used to get all together, like family, and fireworks, and</br>   it was the long weekend, so we would go swimming, we would go to the river.</br>   In Minnesota, it was the river. In California, it was to the ocean, to the</br>   sea, to the bay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you do hotdogs and stuff on July 4th?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. Well, always, always, on Thanksgiving it was the turkey. On</br>   the side, they would make some Mexican food. Same thing on the Fourth of</br>   July. We would make some Mexican food.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, let me ask you just one final question about the deportation.</br>   Could you have done your papers earlier?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There was nothing you could have done?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: There was a period, because on the beginning, I had my interview,</br>   in Ciudad Juarez, but they asked me for a waiver. So, when they asked me</br>   for the waiver, I will have to reschedule another appointment. When that</br>   happens, she didn't really help me out anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But when you were still in the United States, did you delay?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. The processes, it takes too long. That's why they let me</br>   go—Immigration, when they got me, they let me go, because I was in the</br>   process for my papers. They told me to keep going to court.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you have any contact with your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old is she?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: She's 15. Not at all, her mom doesn't let her talk to me at all.</br>   Not even with my son. But I mean, life is good. What can I say? Before it</br>   was really hard, but now I'm used to it. I have to keep living with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You sound like an amazing dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm trying to. It's hard. Believe me. Two years ago, my mom passed</br>   away. So, she was the one that used to help me a lot. But now it got a</br>   little bit harder, because now he's getting a little bit older, and he's</br>   getting older, and the problems start.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. You don't have a partner?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. No, I'm single. [Laughs]. No, I mean, I used to have a</br>   girlfriend. But nothing else.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you for sharing your story.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, thank you to you. I wanted to talk. I mean, this is something</br>   that is like therapy, because it helps me. Yesterday, one of my friends</br>   came, and she was like, &quot;You need this. You need to go.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And? How do you feel now?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I like it. I like it a lot. It's something new. It's something</br>   that I'll let everything go at this moment.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You really sound like an incredible dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Thank you. I appreciate it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's very, very moving.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I appreciate it. I've been here for a lot of time. It’s tough to</br>   be a dad sometimes. Sometimes there is things that I want to do, but I</br>   can't because I have to be at home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You know, I've been hearing stories all day long, about kids who</br>   went, and their Mexican dads abandoned them.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, that won't happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm ending my day – You are helping me.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, I mean—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You are giving me—</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: One of the reasons that I will never do that, is because my dad,</br>   when he was in the states, he left me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad did it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He left me. From that, I was like, “No.” From that, I was like,</br>   &quot;No, I can't do that.&quot; I mean, I wouldn't do it. My son is my son, and</br>   he'll always be there.</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up on June 8, 2019</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Okay. Has the last year been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh. What's been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, first of all is because for some time I stayed without a</br>   job. Why? Because I was trying to ... For me to find a job is really hard</br>   because I had to be with him. At the same time, I had to take care of him</br>   from school, so for me it was really hard. So, I found a job, but it was</br>   two hours and a half from my house just to go. And to come back, it was two</br>   hours and a half. It was almost four to five hours, so I wouldn't have time</br>   for him. And not just to take him to the school, to help him to do</br>   homework. It's really hard. But I stayed without a job for two months.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: So right now, I found a really good job. I mean, it's really good.</br>   I work from Monday to Friday. It's 45 minutes away from my house, so it's</br>   really good. And then I got Saturdays and Sundays off.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: This is East Concourse Servicing. It's just a call center, but</br>   it's a collision agency. I mean, it's pretty good. I wouldn't say, I don't</br>   make a lot of money, but I'm getting there. It's close to my house. I will</br>   be able to take him to school, and then he will have to go from school to</br>   the house by himself. But I know that he went to the school. I know he will</br>   be there, and I got time for him because I only work nine hours.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You work nine hours per day?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. From Monday to Friday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are you being paid?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, right now, the gross pay is $8,000. I mean, 8,000 pesos. I'm</br>   sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: 8,000 pesos for ...</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Per month. Plus with that you have 2,000 pesos in vales de</br>   despensa, that’s what they call the food vouchers they give you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Plus 2,000?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo:</br> </br> </br>   Per month. Plus a bonus that we could get. We could get from 2,000 probably</br>   three or 4,000 more. All depends. And I mean, it's pretty good because I</br>   got time to spend with him on the weekends. He's getting older already. I</br>   mean, he's not a boy anymore. He's growing up, so I have to take care of</br>   more of him. I have to be more time with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are you worried about him?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are you worried about?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: About everything. I mean, to be really honest with you, I don't</br>   know, but if you go to one school from here from Mexico-</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo:</br> </br> </br>   I'm worried because sometimes you never know what could happen. Sometimes</br>   they could go to the ... On the way to the school, there's a lot of danger</br>   sometimes, even to cross the avenues. Some people, there's a lot of bad</br>   people around here, too, sometimes, no? So that's why I'm worried. That's</br>   why I'm always trying to get a good job, to have the money so we could</br>   survive. At the same time, so I could be able to be with him, too, when he</br>   needs. Right now, it takes me time, but the job that I have, it gives me</br>   the opportunity to do a lot of things with him. So that's what I want, and</br>   I want to stay with that job for a while. I mean, it's really good. I don't</br>   make as much money as before, but I will be able to be at home to cook for</br>   him, to do things with him. So that's something that I really wanted to do</br>   because it's only him and me. If we don't take care of each other, who's</br>   going to take care of us?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And do you ever think about him going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Last week ... I have another daughter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. I remember.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I don't know if you ever remember that I told you. She's going to</br>   be 17 already next year, so she didn't talk to me at all before. She</br>   started talking to me last Sunday. She was like, &quot;You know what? I want to</br>   go and visit you guys.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Great.&quot; Well, I was happy. It’s</br>   something that I would never expect. First of all, I never expect that</br>   phone call at all. Second of all, when she says, &quot;Well, I want to see you</br>   guys,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;I want to see you, too, Mija, but we had to wait for</br>   you to get the passport and everything.&quot; I know it's going to be a process</br>   and you know everything will cost money, but I will make it. Probably next</br>   year, she will be here, at least for a couple weeks, no?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: But, yes, I want him to get the passport and everything so he can</br>   go, too. Later on, I want to see if I could get my visa, just to go and</br>   visit them or just to take him to visit and so he will be able to know his</br>   country. Because, believe it or not, he wants to go and see. Sometimes he,</br>   like in the school, sometimes he gets racismo. I don't like it. I want him</br>   to go over there, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He gets racism because?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because he was born over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But how do they know?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: In the school and by the teacher, by one teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But how do they know? He doesn't speak a word of English.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know but everybody around there knows him. They know who he is,</br>   and they know me, too, and they're like, &quot;Well, he was born over there, but</br>   he doesn't speak English. But he's born over there. “Es el gringo.&quot; [he’s</br>   the gringo] I mean, that's how they tell him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what does he answer back? What do you answer?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] Cuando te dicen el gringo en la escuela o el maestro</br>   que te decia, que decias? [when they call you the gringo in school what do</br>   you say?]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: [inaudible]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pero que le decias? Es la pregunta. [what do you say? that’s the</br>   question]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: [inaudible]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He's always shy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I know. Except when he's dancing.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know. [laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what is he saying? What does he tell you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: On the beginning, he got upset because we talk about it. I was</br>   like, &quot;You know what? If you want me, I will go and talk with that teacher</br>   to stop the bullying,&quot; because he's pretty much that. But he getting to</br>   swear me he doesn't care. He's like from here. He just, you know, nothing</br>   changes. It’s just like normal because he's been raised in here for almost</br>   all his life.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did your daughter get in touch with yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: By her grandma. I had her grandma in Facebook, and we talk</br>   sometimes, and she got ahold of me by phone. I was like, &quot;Great.&quot; I mean,</br>   it was for a long time that she wouldn't get in touch with me. She didn't</br>   even try to talk to me, and now she did. I'm like, &quot;Well, this is one step,</br>   no, towards –.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your friends with her grandma, which is your ex-wife's mother, on</br>   Facebook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I get along with them, except with the mom. I get along with both</br>   sisters, with both brothers, and with the grandma. I mean, we get along,</br>   but with her, we don't get in touch at all. I mean, she doesn't want to</br>   talk to me, and I mean, that's fine because she's already with somebody</br>   else. I respect that. Plus, I don't want to know anything about it either.</br>   But there's something, she don't want… It's because she doesn't want... She</br>   will want it. She will be like, &quot;You know what? I pay for the passport. She</br>   pays for this. We do this. We do that.&quot; So, he will be able to go over</br>   there, and my daughter will be able to come over there. We could be</br>   connected, but she doesn’t want to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She doesn't want to? But is she going to allow her daughter to come</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, that's the thing that we were planning. I mean, I was</br>   telling my daughter, &quot;Right now, I wish I could have the money to be like,</br>   'You know what? I'll send you for the passport. And I have the plane</br>   ticket.'&quot; But it's a process. I mean, I don't want to put things on the</br>   hurry. I want just to be little by little. Probably if not by when she will</br>   be 18, it will be different. Right now, this is one step. I know in one</br>   time she will be able to come and is sooner than before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When was the last time you saw her?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh, yeah. It has 11 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's been 11 years?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: It's been 11 years, and I want to see her already. I mean, I want</br>   to see her. I know she needs me, and I need her, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you spoken on FaceTime?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you see each other?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But, I mean, it's not the same. I wish it would be like I</br>   could have her here right here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Does she look like you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I will show you a picture right now. Let me see. Hold on. Let me</br>   see. She's really big, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's her name again?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: America Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: American-</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: America.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: America.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Natalie. Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, my daughter's name is Natalie. Did you know that? Did you say</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, I think you remember that you told me. Yeah, she's Natalie.</br>   I'm trying to find a picture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's a great name. You called her America?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. That's her name. I got some pictures, but ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So these guys are actually Roddy and ... Do you call her America or</br>   Natalie?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And Natalie are actually real sister?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, they're real brother.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And they're complete siblings, by blood?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: By blood. Yeah. They by blood. Oh, this one.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, wow. Is this her?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. She's pretty.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And she's really tall, they say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She looks like – Well, so are you.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: You think so?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She looks like you. She really does.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, and she's the big one. She's right now 16. She's going to be</br>   17.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. Well, that's great. So she Facebooked you once?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, I mean-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All of a sudden you got a message on Facebook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Saying, &quot;Hi, this is Natalie&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: &quot;Hi, Dad. This is Natalie.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Hi. How you doing? It</br>   was great to get to know you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It must have been.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. It was good. I mean, I wasn't – On Sunday, we were just</br>   watching TV, and then I just see my cellphone, and it says, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; And</br>   I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; Then I was like, &quot;Hey, how you doing, and how you been?&quot;</br>   And that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Pretending for it not to be a big deal, but of course.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, and it was good. I mean, because I know her mom wasn't</br>   around, so she will be able to talk to me to tell me more things. Because</br>   on the last times when I talked to her, it was like, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; &quot;How you</br>   doing?&quot; &quot;Oh, hi. How are you?” “Bye.&quot; That's it. She wouldn't be able to</br>   tell me, &quot;Hey, this is what's happening over here. I miss you. I want to</br>   go,&quot; or something like that. It's a good start.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she said those things?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Now, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And has she talked to [gestures to Roddy]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. [to Roddy] ¿Si, verdad que hablaste con Natalie también?</br>   [you talked to Natalie too, right?]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: ¿Que?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] ¿Hablaste con Natalie? [you talked to Natalie?] [to</br>   Anita] I mean, but the difference between them is that we have one issue.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Language.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He doesn't speak English, and she doesn't speak Spanish. So, I</br>   mean, he may understand a little bit, but some words and something. It's</br>   all the same thing. She may know some Spanish and words, but that's it. So,</br>   it's kind of strange. I mean, she doesn't speak Spanish, and he doesn't</br>   speak English.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And it happens. I mean, but we're fine, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well, that's fantastic news. I'm just going to ask you. The most</br>   difficult challenges you faced this year was finding a job?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Losing my job and finding a job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Over the years, things have gotten better, though?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, yeah. I mean, yes. The only thing is that when you don't</br>   have a job, that's a little bit hard. But then when you start working, you</br>   start getting on your feet. You start on the track again, but we're getting</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you know about programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not really. No, because even right here if you check, they have</br>   help for madres solteras, [single mothers] but it won't happen to me</br>   because I'm a single dad. I won't qualify for that. I mean, sometimes it</br>   will be great just because you will get benefits like programs where they</br>   can go and do some sports or something like that. But I don't apply, and he</br>   won't apply either because he's not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, let me just finish this. We ask which of your relatives live in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: My brother and my sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. Siblings. Are you in touch with them?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We live together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, so you live with your brother and sister?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We live together in the same house. Like everybody has his own</br>   part, but I mean, everybody – they have to go to work. They have their own</br>   families, so sometimes, even though they help you out and we help each</br>   other, but sometimes you have to do things because they got other things to</br>   do, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Would you consider going back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because I grew up over there, and to be honest with you, I miss a</br>   lot over there. I know I could do more things over there than over here,</br>   but you know one of the things that I don't want to go illegally, not</br>   anymore. I mean, I want to go legally, and I know it may take some time.</br>   But I could do it because my son and my daughter, they're from over there.</br>   They will be able to get my papers fixed. When that happens, I want to be</br>   able to go legally, and I want to go to work, do some things. Like how it</br>   was my American dream back when I was over there. Right here, I won't say</br>   that. At the beginning, when I got here, I didn't know nobody. It was</br>   really hard. I got in depression and a lot of things, but now, I mean, I'm</br>   living day by day, and I have to like it. I'm okay now. But, yes, I will go</br>   back one day. But I want to go legally, not illegal.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="a407f687-084d-4513-ac91-80a7fb965977" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Reflections, Dreams, Policy to help migrants">Anita: And one question is do you think that the US government has<br>
   responsibility for Roddy?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: In some parts, I think, but they won't do anything. I mean, to be<br>
   really honest with you, they never going to do anything because they have<br>
   so many people over there. It's not just Americans. It's not Mexicans. It's<br>
   everybody. It's all the Latin people, all the people from Europe or from<br>
   Africa. There's a lot of immigrants from over there, and they, some of<br>
   them, they already born over there. So, they're Americans, too. They don't<br>
   even receive help.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But what about Roddy being here. What kind of responsibilities –<br>
   What do you think the US government should do to help Roddy?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, what I would like is probably just to help him with medical.<br>
   That would be all. I mean, because over there, they give you that – How's<br>
   it called? That program that they give you meals and all that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: And they give you benefits. Well, for that, I mean, I work for it,<br>
   and we used to pay our own things with your own work. But, I mean, I<br>
   wouldn't ask for money. The only thing that I would ask is for medical<br>
   assistance for him.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What about for his school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: And schooling. Yeah. And that's one of the things, too, because on<br>
   the future, one of the things that I want him sooner or later for him to go<br>
   back is because I want him to go to school over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: He's got to learn English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. So right now, my goal up to this point is I want him to go<br>
   to an English school, and that's my new goal. I won't be able to do it in<br>
   this month, but probably next month, he will start doing English. And not<br>
   because I don't want to. It's because we need money to do all the process,<br>
   too. I'm starting my track and probably not this paycheck, I can’t do it,<br>
   but next paycheck, next month, I will be able to do it. And that's<br>
   something that I really want to do because, to be really honest, I probably<br>
   just want to stay probably right here one or two years more, and he may go<br>
   back. That's something that I have. I want him to go to high school over<br>
   there, just out of high school to go to college, so he could start the<br>
   school over there already.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And would his mother – could he live with his mother?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No. No. I grew up in California, and I got a lot of aunts for my<br>
   mom's side. So, they will be able to take care of him, and plus, that's my<br>
   other goal, too. For next years, I want to try to apply for my visa. I<br>
   mean, I don't have no bad records at all over there. I didn't do anything<br>
   wrong over there. I came over here to fix my papers. I have everything, but<br>
   it didn't happen. So, I never tried to come back illegally, so I want to go<br>
   and try to get my visa. If I get it, good. If not, I'm just going to wait<br>
   for him to get my papers fixed. So that's my dream. I wish it will be done,<br>
   but we will try.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Those are great dreams. That's great dreams. Let me stop </span><span id="08aa97fa-92ab-4393-96d0-69bdcd268665" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Reflections, States">Anita: Would you consider going back to the US?<br>

 <br>

   Rodrigo: Because I grew up over there, and to be honest with you, I miss a<br>

   but you know one of the things that I don't want to go illegally, not<br>

   because I didn't have a social security number. So, I didn't have a way to<br>
   keep studying. I had to work. The only work that they have over there, it<br>

That's what I did. It was not a lot. I</br>   didn't work, like I say. I used to work for three weeks, and then from</br>   there, I would be at home. Just to get some money to buy my clothes for the</br>   new year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, when you worked in the fields, you worked with other Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who were working full-time?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was that? Did they say, &quot;You lucky kid, you're going to school?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. Pretty much, I used to work with my aunts. One of my aunts,</br>   the one that raised me, she would go with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She worked in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. She would go with me, and she would take a look at me, keep</br>   an eye on me, just so nothing happens, because, you know, the border patrol</br>   and immigration would go in the fields. So, she always was there for me.</br>   She's like the main [inaudible].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year is this in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm talking about '98 to 2001.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, your aunts really wanted you to finish school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Pretty much, I grew up with them. My mom was here in Mexico.</br>   But pretty much, they helped me a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did they have children of their own?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yes, my cousins, my little cousins. They're not little</br>   anymore.

They were not old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In California, were your friends mainly Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. First of all, it was Mexicans. Then when I started getting to</br>   know them a little bit more, and then started speaking more English, then I</br>   started getting Mexicans that were born there, they’re called Chicanos.</br>   Other Mexicans. Pretty much, it was Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any friends that weren't Chicano or Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much in the beginning it was Mexicans. Then after that, it</br>   was more Chicanos too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about others?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not really. Not in California. It's because pretty much all of the</br>   people are Mexican or Chicano. You could find some other kinds of people,</br>   but that's ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about school? Were there other kind of people at school? Or was</br>   everybody at school Mexican or Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, I mean, it was ... How can I say it? Because I didn't know</br>   enough English. They would put you aside. Not aside, but they would put</br>   you, &quot;Okay, you don't talk English, you have to go to ESL class.&quot; &quot;Okay,</br>   you're American, you're fine, you went to English class.&quot; It was different</br>   because all of the Mexicans, that we didn't know English, we were all in</br>   the same classes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about Central Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I didn't have that many right there in California. It was probably</br>   a field thing, from Guatemala. It was probably a few, like five, it wasn't</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, so you couldn't find a job that wouldn't have been in the</br>   fields after finishing high school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: After finishing high school. Then from there, I moved back to</br>   Minnesota. In Minnesota, that's when I started working in a fiberglass</br>   company. We used to make snowmobiles, all of that kind of parts. Even the</br>   front end from the buses, they are made from fiberglass. Even parts for</br>   airplanes. We used to make them, because they're made of fiberglass. That's</br>   where I knew more English. That's when I started getting along with white</br>   people. Right there, I met more Central American people. That was more</br>   different, because over there, there is not a lot of Mexicans. So that's</br>   where I learned more skills in English. At the same time, how they lived.</br>   White people, how they lived, black people, how they lived. We will see a</br>   few black people there. But we will see Indian people, how they lived.</br>   Bosnian people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was different about the way that the white people lived to the</br>   way the Mexicans lived?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, pretty much it depends on the persons because you could find</br>   a racist person, or you could find a person that tried to be a Mexican—or</br>   not to be a Mexican but get someone with Mexicans. That's when you compared</br>   those persons. Because some people, they don't care, they just see you, and</br>   some persons, they want to know how you lived, how everything goes. Some</br>   persons, they don't even care about you. When that happens, I got to know a</br>   lot of American people. We used to get along. I will say that they were my</br>   best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. At that point, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to Mexican restaurants? What did you do with them? How</br>   did you hang out with these people?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much, they were from work. On the weekends, we didn't work</br>   on Saturday and Sunday. So sometimes they would show up at the house, and</br>   we will cook out. Even sometimes the weather wouldn't let us, we would</br>   cookout in the garage. That's something that we would do.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you cook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. I mean, even they tried carnitas, carne asada.</br>   [grilled meat] I don’t know if you know tripa [intestine]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. They tried tripa?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. One of my best friends, he loves guacamole. It was something</br>   new for them at that time because it was like nobody knew that guacamole</br>   was avocado. It was something new for them. He would love that. He would</br>   always be like, &quot;I brought some chips, you make the guacamole.&quot; He will</br>   show up at the house, and we will make it. He would get along with my</br>   aunts, with my uncles. He was like a part of the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food did he cook for you? Did they cook for you too?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They just wanted Mexican food.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. His food was pizza, that was all. Pizzas and hamburgers.</br>   Sometimes we would be like, &quot;Let's go out to eat.&quot; &quot;Yeah, let's go.&quot; He</br>   would go, &quot;No, I want some pizza. I want some hamburgers.&quot; I would be like,</br>   &quot;Let's go to my house, let's see what thing we can make.&quot; One thing he</br>   would love, it was tinga. I don't know if you know—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes, I know what tinga is. My favorite tacos.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. We would make it—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: With chicken?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, with chicken, and onions, and chipotle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's very good. Did you ever go in a snowmobile while you were</br>   there?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, I went on the snowmobile, ice fishing. We would go to</br>   the rivers, and sometimes, especially over there, the ice would be this</br>   much. So, you could close the river and everything. We would go in a</br>   snowmobile. Where I used to work, we made something that is called a</br>   SnoBear. That's like for people that like to go snowmobile, or to go ice</br>   fishing. Sorry. So you got six holes, three in this side, and three in the</br>   other side. You would have a seat for each one. Then you would just go ice</br>   fishing right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you would sit on the ice through a hole?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But it wasn't like a big snowmobile. It's called a SnoBear.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, I see. So they were special snowmobiles to go fishing?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. It would be like a van, and you will have the special thing</br>   like a snowmobile, and you will have three holes right here, but you would</br>   have the seat by the three holes, and three over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see. Did you get used to the cold then?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes, I got used to it. I mean, I lived there for a while. I lived</br>   there for three or four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, there were there other Mexicans who went snowmobiling and did</br>   all of this?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, pretty much it was Mexicans, Americans, because we would get</br>   along. Yeah, we would go. Even in, I still got friends from over there,</br>   they still go ice fishing, and they send me pictures still.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you stayed there for three years?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, from California, I stayed there three years. Then I came</br>   back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I went to work—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: At the fiberglass factory?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I get off from work, and I would have to drive around 45</br>   minutes. I got stopped by the stop sign, for the light, for the back-up</br>   light. It was a sheriff, and he just asked for the driver's license. I have</br>   only the permit license. So, he asked me for if I was a resident, if I</br>   could show any proof. I was honest with him. &quot;No, I'm not.&quot; So, he right</br>   away called Border Patrol.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year is this?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That was I think 2002? But from then, I already had a daughter</br>   right there. I was married.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were married to a Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: To a Chicana.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't get residency?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's another story. [laughs]. No, from there I got deported.</br>   They called Border Patrol. From Border Patrol, they told me that they will</br>   let me go, but I will have to go to court because I already had a daughter,</br>   and I was married, and I had a baby coming. So, from there, I went to court</br>   and everything. But when I went to court, they deported me. So, they gave</br>   me some time to come back to Mexico. So that's been, already, 11 years.</br>   They gave me papers, so I have to come back over here. I came back with my</br>   daughter, because my son, he was only three months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about your wife?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: She stayed over there. But we already made the papers, so we could</br>   fix the residence. But from then, I came over here, and this is a sad</br>   story. I came over here with my daughter, and she was with my son over</br>   there. She came over here, but she was pregnant from somebody else.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. So, from there, she came over here, we tried to fix things.</br>   It didn't work out. I mean, it worked out for a little bit. She went back</br>   to have the baby, and she took my daughter, and she left me my son. So, she</br>   left, and she had the baby, and from there, she didn't fix my papers</br>   anymore. I stayed with my son right here. Right now, I'm a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You're a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. My son is from over there, he's already 11 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He's living with you? He's an American.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He's an American. He's living with me. He lives right here; he</br>   goes to school right here. He's going to turn 12 years old next month. I</br>   can't take him back because he doesn't know his mom, and he doesn't want to</br>   know nothing about his mom. He wants to go back with my aunts, but it's</br>   kind of hard. He doesn't want to let me go. I want him to go over there,</br>   but he doesn't want to go without me, and I'm not going back without my</br>   papers. Illegally, I'm not going back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like for you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: It was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was hard?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. Because I didn't know my mom, because I left for so</br>   much time. I didn't know my brother and my sister because they never went</br>   over there. I came over here, I couldn't find a job. I didn't know how to</br>   work right here. It was everything different for us. Plus, because we had</br>   tattoos, they were kind of racist, like in the face. Because you got a</br>   tattoo, you cannot get a job. Then it was hard for me to find a job,</br>   because first of all, I didn't have all of my papers, like the security</br>   number that we have right here. So, I started working in a restaurant. From</br>   there, I started looking for other jobs. From there, I started working in a</br>   gas station. Whatever I will put the gas, and whatever they will give me,</br>   that's it. That would be what I get.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's it?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's it. Plus, I will have to pay to the gas station for me</br>   working there. Yeah. When you go right here, and you see the gas stations,</br>   the people that work there, they only work for the tips. They will have to</br>   still pay for that, to the gas station, to be working there. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Then from there, I met this person, on the metro. And I found</br>   TeleTech. I started working there. I worked for three years. I started at</br>   zero, by nothing. I didn't know anything about call centers. From there, I</br>   went to [inaudible] for nine months. From there, I stayed there for three</br>   years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What company do you work for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Right now, I started working for Alliance.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The insurance company?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The insurance company. I got like three weeks that I started</br>   there. But before that, I worked at AT&amp;amp;T.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I haven't started working. I worked three years for</br>   TeleTech. As soon as I finished with TeleTech, I went to AT&amp;amp;T. I was</br>   already hired, and then I quit over here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how long were you with AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: A year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did customer service for AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Customer service. I assume. I worked—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's my phone company.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Good luck. [laughs]. I mean, it's pretty good. As long as you know</br>   the terms and conditions, which we don't really read that much. That's what</br>   happens. We never read it. Sometimes they will call us, and they will call</br>   me and be like, &quot;No, but this guy told me this.&quot; &quot;Did you read the terms</br>   and conditions?&quot; &quot;No, but he tells me this.&quot; &quot;I'm sorry, but you have to</br>   check the terms and conditions.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what should I know about AT&amp;amp;T that I can be careful about?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Just pretty much check terms and conditions.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which terms and conditions? Tell me what I should know.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. Pretty much all the time when customers call, it's</br>   because they have a higher bill, pretty much it’s for that. When you have a</br>   higher bill because you don't got a discount, because all of the things</br>   will be for 12 months or 24 months. They give you another discounts, out of</br>   your bill, every month. You're getting another contract right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When people call you up really angry—like they call up, and some</br>   people are really angry on the phone—what do you do with them? Do you put</br>   them on mute?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, sometimes you listen to them. The first thing that you have</br>   to do—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You seem like such a calm person, so I'm asking you.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The first thing you will have to do is listen to them. Don't</br>   interrupt them. They don't want to hear what you have to tell them, so</br>   don't interrupt them. Let them talk. As soon as they finish, just be like,</br>   &quot;I'll be working on it. Let me check, let me repeat the information.&quot; They</br>   will calm down. As soon as they calm down, you will be like, &quot;Okay, I have</br>   to check what I can offer.&quot; If there is nothing you can offer, you will be</br>   like, &quot;Sorry, sir, there is nothing I can do, but this is what happened,&quot;</br>   and you're telling them everything. Why? Because he's – oh, that person is</br>   not going to yell at you because that person is now telling you everything.</br>   As soon as that point, when you can tell them, &quot;You know what? Your</br>   promotion is not available anymore.&quot; They will get upset –</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They'll accept it?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, sometimes. Other people will get upset, and will think that</br>   a manager or a supervisor, they will ask right away for them. They will</br>   think that they're going to fix everything. But no, they are more specific</br>   on the terms and conditions because they go by the book. So, when an agent</br>   tries to do everything, it's because he's trying. But when you request a</br>   manager, and you're requesting something that agent can't do, you're going</br>   to be denied.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it's better to stick with the agent?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, sometimes. Or sometimes say, &quot;I want to cancel.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I want to cancel.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Ah, is that the best thing?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, because you will go to retention, and they will get the</br>   right skills. It's because every department, they have different skills.</br>   The retention, what are they trying to do? The department of cancellations,</br>   what are they going to do? They have all of the promotions that the</br>   customer is happy for. They never tell you that the promotions, they will</br>   probably hook you up with another contract. Even though you don't say</br>   anything, but by you saying you want another discount, &quot;Okay, don't worry,</br>   I'm going to provide you a 12-month discount.&quot; You're hooked with that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So every time I call AT&amp;amp;T, they're always telling me, &quot;Can I</br>   tell you how we can give you a better ...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But with them, you have a script. They have a script, and</br>   you will have to follow the script. So, the best point is, &quot;You know what?</br>   I want to cancel.&quot; You will go with the department, and they will try to do</br>   anything to keep you as a customer.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. So, I'll never ask for a manager again.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, don't do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just say I want to cancel. This is good. But do you ever put them on</br>   mute and not listen?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Sometimes you have to put it on mute, so the customer can</br>   relax. There are some phones that you will have to let the client speak,</br>   even if you put it on mute, they will be like, &quot;No, I don't want you to go</br>   on mute.&quot; Or some people, &quot;Okay, take your time.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, I'm just wondering, does anyone ... I assume most of these calls</br>   are coming from the United States. Does anyone hear your accent and ever</br>   attack you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh yeah, all of the time. That's in every call center here. I</br>   mean, that happens all of the time, that when you talk to somebody, and</br>   they say, &quot;Oh, I don't want to talk to you. I want someone from the United</br>   States.&quot; The only thing that you control is, &quot;You know what? I'll transfer</br>   you to the IVR—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: To the what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The IVR. &quot;But I won't promise you-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the IVR?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: When you call to customer service—</br> </br> </br>   Tim: An automated system.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. So that's when you will be like, &quot;You know what? Okay. I</br>   will transfer you to the IVR, but I won't promise you that you will be</br>   speaking with somebody from the United States.&quot; They will get upset and</br>   they will hang up. Other than that, you will tell them, &quot;If you want to</br>   talk with someone from the United States, you will have to go to the local</br>   office to do the process because pretty much all of the call centers are</br>   ... I mean, I'm working, right now, Alliance, I don't do any phone calls. I</br>   don't receive phone calls, it's pretty much back office. It's kind of</br>   different. But it's better, I think. It's less pay, but it's better.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that being in the United States, living there, that</br>   there are certain things that made you feel American in any way?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. Because there is one thing, and I'm going to put it</br>   that way. Thanksgiving. Yeah. For me, Thanksgiving is like something that I</br>   had to do on my own. First of all, at my house, they were like, &quot;What's</br>   this? Why you do this?&quot; I go, &quot;It's because I thank God because I have food</br>   on the table.&quot; That's something that we do every year. There’s some points,</br>   football, like baseball, basketball, things like that, that over here, they</br>   don't see it that way. But Thanksgiving, yes, it's something important.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did you become an American football fan?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The Vikings?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Well, pretty much, I'm not a fan for one team only. I like</br>   Vikings, I like the 49ers, and Oakland too—they have no difference to the</br>   Raiders in Oakland, because the only difference is that bridge. But yes,</br>   pretty much, I like a lot of teams that we used to do over there, that we</br>   don't do over here. But I see them doing it. From here, too, I've got some</br>   teams that I knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what about in your way of thinking? Do you think that there is</br>   anything American that's different about Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. I mean, it could be a lot of things. It would be the</br>   persons, the way I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Like you know, the way I think right here, sometimes people are</br>   really close. They don't see further than what Americans can see. Americans</br>   can have liberty to do more things, and Mexicans, they're all tight. They</br>   don't let you do things. That's the difference. For me, like with my son,</br>   he's, right now, he's going to graduate from primaria [elementary school].</br>   I let him go to sleep late. Some people, like my sisters, to their son,</br>   they don't see it that way. So that's something different. I let my son,</br>   with a cell phone. She's like, &quot;No, my son is not going to have a cell</br>   phone until he's older.&quot; That's a difference that we have.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: But I mean, I like it because I'm a single dad. I like to have</br>   communication with him, to be like, &quot;How are you? How is school?&quot; One of</br>   the things, I quit AT&amp;amp;T, that was one. It was far away from my house. I</br>   used to wake up at 4:40 in the morning. I used to be there before seven. I</br>   will get out around six, from AT&amp;amp;T, and I would be at home around, from</br>   eight to nine. That was from Monday to Friday. So, I didn't have time with</br>   my son. Now on the job that I have, I work from seven to three. I work from</br>   Monday to Friday. So, it's pretty good. But my son will go alone to the</br>   school, where I will have to pay a taxi, but I will go to pick him up out</br>   of school. That's something that helps me. I'm not making a lot of money</br>   like I used to. But I'd rather be with my son.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Does your son consider himself Mexican at all?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. He could be one Mexican, and he's completely the Mexican</br>   flag. He knows he's American, but he looks Mexican. If you will tell him,</br>   &quot;Yes, I am from the United States, but I'm from Mexico, too.&quot; He will be</br>   like, &quot;Mexico, Mexico.&quot; This is funny, because sometimes, when we had the</br>   soccer games, Mexico versus United States, we will be at home, and be like,</br>   &quot;A quien le vas?&quot; [who are you rooting for?] He will go, &quot;Mexico.&quot; That's</br>   funny, because that's something that we would play with him because we</br>   would tell him, &quot;But you're not Mexican. You have to go for the United</br>   States.&quot; He's like, &quot;No. I go for Mexico.&quot; But that's something—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who did you go for? Who did you root for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm not really into it, to the soccer. Whatever wins. I'm not used</br>   to it, to soccer games. I'm more used to—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But if somebody asked you to that soccer game? Para quien le va?</br>   [who are you rooting for?]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh, I would be like Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Even over there, I mean ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But I'm wondering, because your son came here so little, whether he</br>   might be more Mexican than you are in some ways.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Even though he's the American, and you're the Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know. That's something that I will tell him. My son doesn't</br>   speak English. Some people will say to me, &quot;Why you don't teach him?&quot; I</br>   mean, I teach him some words. He knows, like I tell him, &quot;Do your bed.&quot; He</br>   knows what I'm telling him. But he doesn’t know how to pronounce it. Why?</br>   Because at school, they only speak Spanish. They don't have an English</br>   class. He doesn't have nobody to talk English but me. I'm the only person.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In his way of thinking, is he more Mexican in some ways than you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, even the way that he talks sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The way that he talks, you said? Like what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We call right here, we talk like Chilango, they have some</br>   different words. I'm from here, but I don't even talk that way. He talks</br>   that way. I'm like, &quot;Mijo, why you talk that way?&quot; I don't mind it, because</br>   he's a good boy. I'm not going to complain about him. Sometimes it's hard</br>   for me, because it's only me and him. Before, when he was a kid, I think he</br>   needed more of his mom. But now, we're getting there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old was he when he came here?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: One year old. Wow. So, he's an American citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who came here because you were deported, and although he's an</br>   American citizen, he's growing up in Mexico — I mean, he's a Mexican</br>   12-year-old.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. I mean, he pretty much, even on Independence Day—that's</br>   another thing that we celebrate here too. Him and me, on fourth of July, we</br>   celebrate. We do something. Everybody is like, &quot;Why you do this?&quot; There is</br>   something that people don't know. It's like Thanksgiving, too. People don't</br>   know why we celebrate that. But we celebrate it, because for me, because I</br>   used to do that, and I want him to keep doing it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So why is July 4th important to you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, we used to get all together, like family, and fireworks, and</br>   it was the long weekend, so we would go swimming, we would go to the river.</br>   In Minnesota, it was the river. In California, it was to the ocean, to the</br>   sea, to the bay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you do hotdogs and stuff on July 4th?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. Well, always, always, on Thanksgiving it was the turkey. On</br>   the side, they would make some Mexican food. Same thing on the Fourth of</br>   July. We would make some Mexican food.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, let me ask you just one final question about the deportation.</br>   Could you have done your papers earlier?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There was nothing you could have done?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: There was a period, because on the beginning, I had my interview,</br>   in Ciudad Juarez, but they asked me for a waiver. So, when they asked me</br>   for the waiver, I will have to reschedule another appointment. When that</br>   happens, she didn't really help me out anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But when you were still in the United States, did you delay?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. The processes, it takes too long. That's why they let me</br>   go—Immigration, when they got me, they let me go, because I was in the</br>   process for my papers. They told me to keep going to court.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you have any contact with your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old is she?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: She's 15. Not at all, her mom doesn't let her talk to me at all.</br>   Not even with my son. But I mean, life is good. What can I say? Before it</br>   was really hard, but now I'm used to it. I have to keep living with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You sound like an amazing dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm trying to. It's hard. Believe me. Two years ago, my mom passed</br>   away. So, she was the one that used to help me a lot. But now it got a</br>   little bit harder, because now he's getting a little bit older, and he's</br>   getting older, and the problems start.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. You don't have a partner?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. No, I'm single. [Laughs]. No, I mean, I used to have a</br>   girlfriend. But nothing else.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you for sharing your story.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, thank you to you. I wanted to talk. I mean, this is something</br>   that is like therapy, because it helps me. Yesterday, one of my friends</br>   came, and she was like, &quot;You need this. You need to go.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And? How do you feel now?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I like it. I like it a lot. It's something new. It's something</br>   that I'll let everything go at this moment.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You really sound like an incredible dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Thank you. I appreciate it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's very, very moving.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I appreciate it. I've been here for a lot of time. It’s tough to</br>   be a dad sometimes. Sometimes there is things that I want to do, but I</br>   can't because I have to be at home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You know, I've been hearing stories all day long, about kids who</br>   went, and their Mexican dads abandoned them.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, that won't happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm ending my day – You are helping me.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, I mean—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You are giving me—</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: One of the reasons that I will never do that, is because my dad,</br>   when he was in the states, he left me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad did it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He left me. From that, I was like, “No.” From that, I was like,</br>   &quot;No, I can't do that.&quot; I mean, I wouldn't do it. My son is my son, and</br>   he'll always be there.</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up on June 8, 2019</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Okay. Has the last year been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh. What's been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, first of all is because for some time I stayed without a</br>   job. Why? Because I was trying to ... For me to find a job is really hard</br>   because I had to be with him. At the same time, I had to take care of him</br>   from school, so for me it was really hard. So, I found a job, but it was</br>   two hours and a half from my house just to go. And to come back, it was two</br>   hours and a half. It was almost four to five hours, so I wouldn't have time</br>   for him. And not just to take him to the school, to help him to do</br>   homework. It's really hard. But I stayed without a job for two months.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: So right now, I found a really good job. I mean, it's really good.</br>   I work from Monday to Friday. It's 45 minutes away from my house, so it's</br>   really good. And then I got Saturdays and Sundays off.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: This is East Concourse Servicing. It's just a call center, but</br>   it's a collision agency. I mean, it's pretty good. I wouldn't say, I don't</br>   make a lot of money, but I'm getting there. It's close to my house. I will</br>   be able to take him to school, and then he will have to go from school to</br>   the house by himself. But I know that he went to the school. I know he will</br>   be there, and I got time for him because I only work nine hours.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You work nine hours per day?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. From Monday to Friday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are you being paid?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, right now, the gross pay is $8,000. I mean, 8,000 pesos. I'm</br>   sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: 8,000 pesos for ...</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Per month. Plus with that you have 2,000 pesos in vales de</br>   despensa, that’s what they call the food vouchers they give you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Plus 2,000?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo:</br> </br> </br>   Per month. Plus a bonus that we could get. We could get from 2,000 probably</br>   three or 4,000 more. All depends. And I mean, it's pretty good because I</br>   got time to spend with him on the weekends. He's getting older already. I</br>   mean, he's not a boy anymore. He's growing up, so I have to take care of</br>   more of him. I have to be more time with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are you worried about him?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are you worried about?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: About everything. I mean, to be really honest with you, I don't</br>   know, but if you go to one school from here from Mexico-</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo:</br> </br> </br>   I'm worried because sometimes you never know what could happen. Sometimes</br>   they could go to the ... On the way to the school, there's a lot of danger</br>   sometimes, even to cross the avenues. Some people, there's a lot of bad</br>   people around here, too, sometimes, no? So that's why I'm worried. That's</br>   why I'm always trying to get a good job, to have the money so we could</br>   survive. At the same time, so I could be able to be with him, too, when he</br>   needs. Right now, it takes me time, but the job that I have, it gives me</br>   the opportunity to do a lot of things with him. So that's what I want, and</br>   I want to stay with that job for a while. I mean, it's really good. I don't</br>   make as much money as before, but I will be able to be at home to cook for</br>   him, to do things with him. So that's something that I really wanted to do</br>   because it's only him and me. If we don't take care of each other, who's</br>   going to take care of us?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="f4574e10-a72f-458a-81ab-c07f1875c6ad" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="States, Family reunification, Mexico, Racism">Anita: And do you ever think about him going back to the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Last week ... I have another daughter.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yes. I remember.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I don't know if you ever remember that I told you. She's going to<br>
   be 17 already next year, so she didn't talk to me at all before. She<br>
   started talking to me last Sunday. She was like, &quot;You know what? I want to<br>
   go and visit you guys.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Great.&quot; Well, I was happy. It’s<br>
   something that I would never expect. First of all, I never expect that<br>
   phone call at all. Second of all, when she says, &quot;Well, I want to see you<br>
   guys,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;I want to see you, too, Mija, but we had to wait for<br>
   you to get the passport and everything.&quot; I know it's going to be a process<br>
   and you know everything will cost money, but I will make it. Probably next<br>
   year, she will be here, at least for a couple weeks, no?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: But, yes, I want him to get the passport and everything so he can<br>
   go, too. Later on, I want to see if I could get my visa, just to go and<br>
   visit them or just to take him to visit and so he will be able to know his<br>
   country. Because, believe it or not, he wants to go and see. Sometimes he,<br>
   like in the school, sometimes he gets racismo. I don't like it. I want him<br>
   to go over there, too.<br>

   &quot;A quien le vas?&quot; [who are you rooting for?] He will go, &quot;Mexico.&quot; That's<br>
   funny, because that's something that we would play with him because we<br>
   would tell him, &quot;But you're not Mexican. You have to go for the United<br>
   States.&quot; He's like, &quot;No. I go for Mexico.&quot;</span> But that's something—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who did you go for? Who did you root for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm not really into it, to the soccer. Whatever wins. I'm not used</br>   to it, to soccer games. I'm more used to—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But if somebody asked you to that soccer game? Para quien le va?</br>   [who are you rooting for?]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh, I would be like Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Even over there, I mean ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But I'm wondering, because your son came here so little, whether he</br>   might be more Mexican than you are in some ways.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Even though he's the American, and you're the Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know. That's something that I will tell him. My son doesn't</br>   speak English. Some people will say to me, &quot;Why you don't teach him?&quot; I</br>   mean, I teach him some words. He knows, like I tell him, &quot;Do your bed.&quot; He</br>   knows what I'm telling him. But he doesn’t know how to pronounce it. Why?</br>   Because at school, they only speak Spanish. They don't have an English</br>   class. He doesn't have nobody to talk English but me. I'm the only person.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In his way of thinking, is he more Mexican in some ways than you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, even the way that he talks sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The way that he talks, you said? Like what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We call right here, we talk like Chilango, they have some</br>   different words. I'm from here, but I don't even talk that way. He talks</br>   that way. I'm like, &quot;Mijo, why you talk that way?&quot; I don't mind it, because</br>   he's a good boy. I'm not going to complain about him. Sometimes it's hard</br>   for me, because it's only me and him. Before, when he was a kid, I think he</br>   needed more of his mom. But now, we're getting there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old was he when he came here?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: One year old. Wow. So, he's an American citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who came here because you were deported, and although he's an</br>   American citizen, he's growing up in Mexico — I mean, he's a Mexican</br>   12-year-old.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. I mean, he pretty much, even on Independence Day—that's</br>   another thing that we celebrate here too. Him and me, on fourth of July, we</br>   celebrate. We do something. Everybody is like, &quot;Why you do this?&quot; There is</br>   something that people don't know. It's like Thanksgiving, too. People don't</br>   know why we celebrate that. But we celebrate it, because for me, because I</br>   used to do that, and I want him to keep doing it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So why is July 4th important to you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, we used to get all together, like family, and fireworks, and</br>   it was the long weekend, so we would go swimming, we would go to the river.</br>   In Minnesota, it was the river. In California, it was to the ocean, to the</br>   sea, to the bay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you do hotdogs and stuff on July 4th?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. Well, always, always, on Thanksgiving it was the turkey. On</br>   the side, they would make some Mexican food. Same thing on the Fourth of</br>   July. We would make some Mexican food.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, let me ask you just one final question about the deportation.</br>   Could you have done your papers earlier?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There was nothing you could have done?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: There was a period, because on the beginning, I had my interview,</br>   in Ciudad Juarez, but they asked me for a waiver. So, when they asked me</br>   for the waiver, I will have to reschedule another appointment. When that</br>   happens, she didn't really help me out anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But when you were still in the United States, did you delay?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. The processes, it takes too long. That's why they let me</br>   go—Immigration, when they got me, they let me go, because I was in the</br>   process for my papers. They told me to keep going to court.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you have any contact with your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old is she?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: She's 15. Not at all, her mom doesn't let her talk to me at all.</br>   Not even with my son. But I mean, life is good. What can I say? Before it</br>   was really hard, but now I'm used to it. I have to keep living with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You sound like an amazing dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm trying to. It's hard. Believe me. Two years ago, my mom passed</br>   away. So, she was the one that used to help me a lot. But now it got a</br>   little bit harder, because now he's getting a little bit older, and he's</br>   getting older, and the problems start.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. You don't have a partner?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. No, I'm single. [Laughs]. No, I mean, I used to have a</br>   girlfriend. But nothing else.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you for sharing your story.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, thank you to you. I wanted to talk. I mean, this is something</br>   that is like therapy, because it helps me. Yesterday, one of my friends</br>   came, and she was like, &quot;You need this. You need to go.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And? How do you feel now?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I like it. I like it a lot. It's something new. It's something</br>   that I'll let everything go at this moment.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You really sound like an incredible dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Thank you. I appreciate it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's very, very moving.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I appreciate it. I've been here for a lot of time. It’s tough to</br>   be a dad sometimes. Sometimes there is things that I want to do, but I</br>   can't because I have to be at home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You know, I've been hearing stories all day long, about kids who</br>   went, and their Mexican dads abandoned them.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, that won't happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm ending my day – You are helping me.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, I mean—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You are giving me—</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: One of the reasons that I will never do that, is because my dad,</br>   when he was in the states, he left me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad did it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He left me. From that, I was like, “No.” From that, I was like,</br>   &quot;No, I can't do that.&quot; I mean, I wouldn't do it. My son is my son, and</br>   he'll always be there.</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up on June 8, 2019</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Okay. Has the last year been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh. What's been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, first of all is because for some time I stayed without a</br>   job. Why? Because I was trying to ... For me to find a job is really hard</br>   because I had to be with him. At the same time, I had to take care of him</br>   from school, so for me it was really hard. So, I found a job, but it was</br>   two hours and a half from my house just to go. And to come back, it was two</br>   hours and a half. It was almost four to five hours, so I wouldn't have time</br>   for him. And not just to take him to the school, to help him to do</br>   homework. It's really hard. But I stayed without a job for two months.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: So right now, I found a really good job. I mean, it's really good.</br>   I work from Monday to Friday. It's 45 minutes away from my house, so it's</br>   really good. And then I got Saturdays and Sundays off.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: This is East Concourse Servicing. It's just a call center, but</br>   it's a collision agency. I mean, it's pretty good. I wouldn't say, I don't</br>   make a lot of money, but I'm getting there. It's close to my house. I will</br>   be able to take him to school, and then he will have to go from school to</br>   the house by himself. But I know that he went to the school. I know he will</br>   be there, and I got time for him because I only work nine hours.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You work nine hours per day?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. From Monday to Friday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are you being paid?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, right now, the gross pay is $8,000. I mean, 8,000 pesos. I'm</br>   sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: 8,000 pesos for ...</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Per month. Plus with that you have 2,000 pesos in vales de</br>   despensa, that’s what they call the food vouchers they give you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Plus 2,000?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo:</br> </br> </br>   Per month. Plus a bonus that we could get. We could get from 2,000 probably</br>   three or 4,000 more. All depends. And I mean, it's pretty good because I</br>   got time to spend with him on the weekends. He's getting older already. I</br>   mean, he's not a boy anymore. He's growing up, so I have to take care of</br>   more of him. I have to be more time with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are you worried about him?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are you worried about?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: About everything. I mean, to be really honest with you, I don't</br>   know, but if you go to one school from here from Mexico-</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo:</br> </br> </br>   I'm worried because sometimes you never know what could happen. Sometimes</br>   they could go to the ... On the way to the school, there's a lot of danger</br>   sometimes, even to cross the avenues. Some people, there's a lot of bad</br>   people around here, too, sometimes, no? So that's why I'm worried. That's</br>   why I'm always trying to get a good job, to have the money so we could</br>   survive. At the same time, so I could be able to be with him, too, when he</br>   needs. Right now, it takes me time, but the job that I have, it gives me</br>   the opportunity to do a lot of things with him. So that's what I want, and</br>   I want to stay with that job for a while. I mean, it's really good. I don't</br>   make as much money as before, but I will be able to be at home to cook for</br>   him, to do things with him. So that's something that I really wanted to do</br>   because it's only him and me. If we don't take care of each other, who's</br>   going to take care of us?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And do you ever think about him going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Last week ... I have another daughter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. I remember.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I don't know if you ever remember that I told you. She's going to</br>   be 17 already next year, so she didn't talk to me at all before. She</br>   started talking to me last Sunday. She was like, &quot;You know what? I want to</br>   go and visit you guys.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Great.&quot; Well, I was happy. It’s</br>   something that I would never expect. First of all, I never expect that</br>   phone call at all. Second of all, when she says, &quot;Well, I want to see you</br>   guys,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;I want to see you, too, Mija, but we had to wait for</br>   you to get the passport and everything.&quot; I know it's going to be a process</br>   and you know everything will cost money, but I will make it. Probably next</br>   year, she will be here, at least for a couple weeks, no?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: But, yes, I want him to get the passport and everything so he can</br>   go, too. Later on, I want to see if I could get my visa, just to go and</br>   visit them or just to take him to visit and so he will be able to know his</br>   country. Because, believe it or not, he wants to go and see. Sometimes he,</br>   like in the school, sometimes he gets racismo. I don't like it. I want him</br>   to go over there, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He gets racism because?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because he was born over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But how do they know?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: In the school and by the teacher, by one teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But how do they know? He doesn't speak a word of English.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know but everybody around there knows him. They know who he is,</br>   and they know me, too, and they're like, &quot;Well, he was born over there, but</br>   he doesn't speak English. But he's born over there. “Es el gringo.&quot; [he’s</br>   the gringo] I mean, that's how they tell him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what does he answer back? What do you answer?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] Cuando te dicen el gringo en la escuela o el maestro</br>   que te decia, que decias? [when they call you the gringo in school what do</br>   you say?]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: [inaudible]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pero que le decias? Es la pregunta. [what do you say? that’s the</br>   question]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: [inaudible]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He's always shy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I know. Except when he's dancing.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know. [laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what is he saying? What does he tell you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: On the beginning, he got upset because we talk about it. I was</br>   like, &quot;You know what? If you want me, I will go and talk with that teacher</br>   to stop the bullying,&quot; because he's pretty much that. But he getting to</br>   swear me he doesn't care. He's like from here. He just, you know, nothing</br>   changes. It’s just like normal because he's been raised in here for almost</br>   all his life.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did your daughter get in touch with yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: By her grandma. I had her grandma in Facebook, and we talk</br>   sometimes, and she got ahold of me by phone. I was like, &quot;Great.&quot; I mean,</br>   it was for a long time that she wouldn't get in touch with me. She didn't</br>   even try to talk to me, and now she did. I'm like, &quot;Well, this is one step,</br>   no, towards –.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your friends with her grandma, which is your ex-wife's mother, on</br>   Facebook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I get along with them, except with the mom. I get along with both</br>   sisters, with both brothers, and with the grandma. I mean, we get along,</br>   but with her, we don't get in touch at all. I mean, she doesn't want to</br>   talk to me, and I mean, that's fine because she's already with somebody</br>   else. I respect that. Plus, I don't want to know anything about it either.</br>   But there's something, she don't want… It's because she doesn't want... She</br>   will want it. She will be like, &quot;You know what? I pay for the passport. She</br>   pays for this. We do this. We do that.&quot; So, he will be able to go over</br>   there, and my daughter will be able to come over there. We could be</br>   connected, but she doesn’t want to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She doesn't want to? But is she going to allow her daughter to come</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, that's the thing that we were planning. I mean, I was</br>   telling my daughter, &quot;Right now, I wish I could have the money to be like,</br>   'You know what? I'll send you for the passport. And I have the plane</br>   ticket.'&quot; But it's a process. I mean, I don't want to put things on the</br>   hurry. I want just to be little by little. Probably if not by when she will</br>   be 18, it will be different. Right now, this is one step. I know in one</br>   time she will be able to come and is sooner than before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When was the last time you saw her?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh, yeah. It has 11 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's been 11 years?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: It's been 11 years, and I want to see her already. I mean, I want</br>   to see her. I know she needs me, and I need her, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you spoken on FaceTime?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you see each other?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But, I mean, it's not the same. I wish it would be like I</br>   could have her here right here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Does she look like you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I will show you a picture right now. Let me see. Hold on. Let me</br>   see. She's really big, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's her name again?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: America Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: American-</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: America.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: America.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Natalie. Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, my daughter's name is Natalie. Did you know that? Did you say</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, I think you remember that you told me. Yeah, she's Natalie.</br>   I'm trying to find a picture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's a great name. You called her America?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. That's her name. I got some pictures, but ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So these guys are actually Roddy and ... Do you call her America or</br>   Natalie?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And Natalie are actually real sister?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, they're real brother.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And they're complete siblings, by blood?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: By blood. Yeah. They by blood. Oh, this one.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, wow. Is this her?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. She's pretty.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And she's really tall, they say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She looks like – Well, so are you.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: You think so?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She looks like you. She really does.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, and she's the big one. She's right now 16. She's going to be</br>   17.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. Well, that's great. So she Facebooked you once?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, I mean-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All of a sudden you got a message on Facebook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Saying, &quot;Hi, this is Natalie&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: &quot;Hi, Dad. This is Natalie.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Hi. How you doing? It</br>   was great to get to know you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It must have been.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. It was good. I mean, I wasn't – On Sunday, we were just</br>   watching TV, and then I just see my cellphone, and it says, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; And</br>   I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; Then I was like, &quot;Hey, how you doing, and how you been?&quot;</br>   And that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Pretending for it not to be a big deal, but of course.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, and it was good. I mean, because I know her mom wasn't</br>   around, so she will be able to talk to me to tell me more things. Because</br>   on the last times when I talked to her, it was like, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; &quot;How you</br>   doing?&quot; &quot;Oh, hi. How are you?” “Bye.&quot; That's it. She wouldn't be able to</br>   tell me, &quot;Hey, this is what's happening over here. I miss you. I want to</br>   go,&quot; or something like that. It's a good start.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she said those things?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Now, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And has she talked to [gestures to Roddy]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. [to Roddy] ¿Si, verdad que hablaste con Natalie también?</br>   [you talked to Natalie too, right?]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: ¿Que?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] ¿Hablaste con Natalie? [you talked to Natalie?] [to</br>   Anita] I mean, but the difference between them is that we have one issue.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Language.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He doesn't speak English, and she doesn't speak Spanish. So, I</br>   mean, he may understand a little bit, but some words and something. It's</br>   all the same thing. She may know some Spanish and words, but that's it. So,</br>   it's kind of strange. I mean, she doesn't speak Spanish, and he doesn't</br>   speak English.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And it happens. I mean, but we're fine, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well, that's fantastic news. I'm just going to ask you. The most</br>   difficult challenges you faced this year was finding a job?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Losing my job and finding a job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Over the years, things have gotten better, though?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, yeah. I mean, yes. The only thing is that when you don't</br>   have a job, that's a little bit hard. But then when you start working, you</br>   start getting on your feet. You start on the track again, but we're getting</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you know about programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not really. No, because even right here if you check, they have</br>   help for madres solteras, [single mothers] but it won't happen to me</br>   because I'm a single dad. I won't qualify for that. I mean, sometimes it</br>   will be great just because you will get benefits like programs where they</br>   can go and do some sports or something like that. But I don't apply, and he</br>   won't apply either because he's not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, let me just finish this. We ask which of your relatives live in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: My brother and my sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. Siblings. Are you in touch with them?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We live together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, so you live with your brother and sister?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We live together in the same house. Like everybody has his own</br>   part, but I mean, everybody – they have to go to work. They have their own</br>   families, so sometimes, even though they help you out and we help each</br>   other, but sometimes you have to do things because they got other things to</br>   do, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Would you consider going back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because I grew up over there, and to be honest with you, I miss a</br>   lot over there. I know I could do more things over there than over here,</br>   but you know one of the things that I don't want to go illegally, not</br>   anymore. I mean, I want to go legally, and I know it may take some time.</br>   But I could do it because my son and my daughter, they're from over there.</br>   They will be able to get my papers fixed. When that happens, I want to be</br>   able to go legally, and I want to go to work, do some things. Like how it</br>   was my American dream back when I was over there. Right here, I won't say</br>   that. At the beginning, when I got here, I didn't know nobody. It was</br>   really hard. I got in depression and a lot of things, but now, I mean, I'm</br>   living day by day, and I have to like it. I'm okay now. But, yes, I will go</br>   back one day. But I want to go legally, not illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And one question is do you think that the US government has</br>   responsibility for Roddy?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: In some parts, I think, but they won't do anything. I mean, to be</br>   really honest with you, they never going to do anything because they have</br>   so many people over there. It's not just Americans. It's not Mexicans. It's</br>   everybody. It's all the Latin people, all the people from Europe or from</br>   Africa. There's a lot of immigrants from over there, and they, some of</br>   them, they already born over there. So, they're Americans, too. They don't</br>   even receive help.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what about Roddy being here. What kind of responsibilities –</br>   What do you think the US government should do to help Roddy?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, what I would like is probably just to help him with medical.</br>   That would be all. I mean, because over there, they give you that – How's</br>   it called? That program that they give you meals and all that?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And they give you benefits. Well, for that, I mean, I work for it,</br>   and we used to pay our own things with your own work. But, I mean, I</br>   wouldn't ask for money. The only thing that I would ask is for medical</br>   assistance for him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about for his school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And schooling. Yeah. And that's one of the things, too, because on</br>   the future, one of the things that I want him sooner or later for him to go</br>   back is because I want him to go to school over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He's got to learn English.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. So right now, my goal up to this point is I want him to go</br>   to an English school, and that's my new goal. I won't be able to do it in</br>   this month, but probably next month, he will start doing English. And not</br>   because I don't want to. It's because we need money to do all the process,</br>   too. I'm starting my track and probably not this paycheck, I can’t do it,</br>   but next paycheck, next month, I will be able to do it. And that's</br>   something that I really want to do because, to be really honest, I probably</br>   just want to stay probably right here one or two years more, and he may go</br>   back. That's something that I have. I want him to go to high school over</br>   there, just out of high school to go to college, so he could start the</br>   school over there already.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And would his mother – could he live with his mother?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. No. I grew up in California, and I got a lot of aunts for my</br>   mom's side. So, they will be able to take care of him, and plus, that's my</br>   other goal, too. For next years, I want to try to apply for my visa. I</br>   mean, I don't have no bad records at all over there. I didn't do anything</br>   wrong over there. I came over here to fix my papers. I have everything, but</br>   it didn't happen. So, I never tried to come back illegally, so I want to go</br>   and try to get my visa. If I get it, good. If not, I'm just going to wait</br>   for him to get my papers fixed. So that's my dream. I wish it will be done,</br>   but we will try.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Those are great dreams. That's great dreams. Let me stop now<span id="eb8e0238-9ac0-4d08-a109-ce9dc0c843fb" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Cultural differences, Family,  single parent"></span>irst of all, I did like five days to stay at home, to get clothes</br>   because pretty much, we didn't have any clothes. So, first of all, we have</br>   to get clothes, get used to it. Then from there, we went to the school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, so I have questions for you. What month was it?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That was in April.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, was it still cold? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. I still see a lot of snow at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the first time you saw snow?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. One time I was right here, by ___, that was the first time</br>   that I see a lot of snow. Then I went to the school, and it was really,</br>   really hard for me because I couldn't say, &quot;May I go to the restroom?&quot; I</br>   couldn't check anything. The first day for me was horrible. Because I</br>   didn't know English. I didn't know anybody. I was a really different person</br>   than the students from there. They just looked at me like, &quot;Who are you?&quot;</br>   Some people would talk to me, and I was like [gestures] with signs. Then</br>   they put me with a tutor. It was just pretty much, all the year, I stayed</br>   with the tutor all the time, just learning English.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tutor nice?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I still remember she was nice to me. Then from there, I</br>   pretty much, I didn't learn a lot, but I learned how to ask for food, to go</br>   to the restroom. Small things. That was in the beginning. Then from</br>   there—that was in 8th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: 8th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because when I started over there, I was in 8th grade. Then from</br>   there, I moved to my aunt’s because my dad left me over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, your dad took you over?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He took me over, but then he left me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he go?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: To Texas. And then he went to Texas, and from there, we haven't</br>   talked since then.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You haven't talked until today, with your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Until today, I haven't. He found somebody else, and he got</br>   married, I guess. He just forgot about me. So, I started living with my</br>   mom's side of the family, with my aunts, and my grandma and grandpa. They</br>   would help me a lot. Then from there, from Minnesota, they wanted to move</br>   to California. So we moved to California. I started high school, 9th grade</br>   to 12th grade, in California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I don't know if you know the Central Valley area. It's a small</br>   town, it's called _________, California. Pretty much all of my family lives</br>   there, and around there. My mom had a big family. There were like 13</br>   brothers in total. So, it was a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So why Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because they live over there. To be honest with you, one of the</br>   reasons that now I get it is because in Minnesota, they didn't have a lot</br>   of Hispanic people. So, when you apply over there to get an</br>   immigration—because my aunts, they were trying to get the residential for</br>   my uncles, for their husbands—it was more faster for them to do it over</br>   there. So, they moved over there. Then they started buying houses. That's</br>   why we stayed there, for a while. Then they come back to California when</br>   they get their papers, and some of my uncles, they stay in Minnesota, and</br>   some, they stay in California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So, was California better than Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much, yes, and no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I have to be honest with you, in California, there were more Latin</br>   people, more Hispanic people, more Mexicans. I will say that, where we</br>   live. It was easier for me because they have more programs on the high</br>   school to learn English. We have the ESL, ESL one, ESL two, ESL three. That</br>   helped me a lot. It was better because I was used to being always at home</br>   back in Minnesota, and over here, not, because it was more sunny. It was</br>   better. It was more familiar with Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how many years were you in Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's another story. I stayed in Minnesota for six, nine months</br>   in the beginning. Then I moved to California, and as soon as I finished the</br>   high school, I moved to Minnesota again.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you move back to Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because I finished high school, and I couldn't go to the college,</br>   because I didn't have a social security number. So, I didn't have a way to</br>   keep studying. I had to work. The only work that they have over there, it</br>   was pretty much for people that don't have papers, was the fields. I didn't</br>   have a way to – a car or something to move.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the fields at all?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. On the summer. Summer I used to work on the fields, just two</br>   or three weeks, just to get some money to buy my clothes for the new year.</br>   So that's what I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what did you do in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Picking onions, and the cotton.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Cotton?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In the Central Valley?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: In the Central Valley area. That's what I did. It was not a lot. I</br>   didn't work, like I say. I used to work for three weeks, and then from</br>   there, I would be at home. Just to get some money to buy my clothes for the</br>   new year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, when you worked in the fields, you worked with other Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who were working full-time?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was that? Did they say, &quot;You lucky kid, you're going to school?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. Pretty much, I used to work with my aunts. One of my aunts,</br>   the one that raised me, she would go with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She worked in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. She would go with me, and she would take a look at me, keep</br>   an eye on me, just so nothing happens, because, you know, the border patrol</br>   and immigration would go in the fields. So, she always was there for me.</br>   She's like the main [inaudible].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year is this in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm talking about '98 to 2001.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, your aunts really wanted you to finish school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Pretty much, I grew up with them. My mom was here in Mexico.</br>   But pretty much, they helped me a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did they have children of their own?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yes, my cousins, my little cousins. They're not little</br>   anymore. I'm like the big brother for them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much older were you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I was 15 when I moved to California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. They were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: They were like five, three, two. They were not old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In California, were your friends mainly Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. First of all, it was Mexicans. Then when I started getting to</br>   know them a little bit more, and then started speaking more English, then I</br>   started getting Mexicans that were born there, they’re called Chicanos.</br>   Other Mexicans. Pretty much, it was Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any friends that weren't Chicano or Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much in the beginning it was Mexicans. Then after that, it</br>   was more Chicanos too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about others?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not really. Not in California. It's because pretty much all of the</br>   people are Mexican or Chicano. You could find some other kinds of people,</br>   but that's ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about school? Were there other kind of people at school? Or was</br>   everybody at school Mexican or Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, I mean, it was ... How can I say it? Because I didn't know</br>   enough English. They would put you aside. Not aside, but they would put</br>   you, &quot;Okay, you don't talk English, you have to go to ESL class.&quot; &quot;Okay,</br>   you're American, you're fine, you went to English class.&quot; It was different</br>   because all of the Mexicans, that we didn't know English, we were all in</br>   the same classes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about Central Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I didn't have that many right there in California. It was probably</br>   a field thing, from Guatemala. It was probably a few, like five, it wasn't</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, so you couldn't find a job that wouldn't have been in the</br>   fields after finishing high school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: After finishing high school. Then from there, I moved back to</br>   Minnesota. In Minnesota, that's when I started working in a fiberglass</br>   company. We used to make snowmobiles, all of that kind of parts. Even the</br>   front end from the buses, they are made from fiberglass. Even parts for</br>   airplanes. We used to make them, because they're made of fiberglass. That's</br>   where I knew more English. That's when I started getting along with white</br>   people. Right there, I met more Central American people. That was more</br>   different, because over there, there is not a lot of Mexicans. So that's</br>   where I learned more skills in English. At the same time, how they lived.</br>   White people, how they lived, black people, how they lived. We will see a</br>   few black people there. But we will see Indian people, how they lived.</br>   Bosnian people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was different about the way that the white people lived to the</br>   way the Mexicans lived?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, pretty much it depends on the persons because you could find</br>   a racist person, or you could find a person that tried to be a Mexican—or</br>   not to be a Mexican but get someone with Mexicans. That's when you compared</br>   those persons. Because some people, they don't care, they just see you, and</br>   some persons, they want to know how you lived, how everything goes. Some</br>   persons, they don't even care about you. When that happens, I got to know a</br>   lot of American people. We used to get along. I will say that they were my</br>   best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. At that point, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to Mexican restaurants? What did you do with them? How</br>   did you hang out with these people?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much, they were from work. On the weekends, we didn't work</br>   on Saturday and Sunday. So sometimes they would show up at the house, and</br>   we will cook out. Even sometimes the weather wouldn't let us, we would</br>   cookout in the garage. That's something that we would do.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you cook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. I mean, even they tried carnitas, carne asada.</br>   [grilled meat] I don’t know if you know tripa [intestine]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. They tried tripa?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. One of my best friends, he loves guacamole. It was something</br>   new for them at that time because it was like nobody knew that guacamole</br>   was avocado. It was something new for them. He would love that. He would</br>   always be like, &quot;I brought some chips, you make the guacamole.&quot; He will</br>   show up at the house, and we will make it. He would get along with my</br>   aunts, with my uncles. He was like a part of the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food did he cook for you? Did they cook for you too?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They just wanted Mexican food.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. His food was pizza, that was all. Pizzas and hamburgers.</br>   Sometimes we would be like, &quot;Let's go out to eat.&quot; &quot;Yeah, let's go.&quot; He</br>   would go, &quot;No, I want some pizza. I want some hamburgers.&quot; I would be like,</br>   &quot;Let's go to my house, let's see what thing we can make.&quot; One thing he</br>   would love, it was tinga. I don't know if you know—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes, I know what tinga is. My favorite tacos.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. We would make it—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: With chicken?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, with chicken, and onions, and chipotle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's very good. Did you ever go in a snowmobile while you were</br>   there?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, I went on the snowmobile, ice fishing. We would go to</br>   the rivers, and sometimes, especially over there, the ice would be this</br>   much. So, you could close the river and everything. We would go in a</br>   snowmobile. Where I used to work, we made something that is called a</br>   SnoBear. That's like for people that like to go snowmobile, or to go ice</br>   fishing. Sorry. So you got six holes, three in this side, and three in the</br>   other side. You would have a seat for each one. Then you would just go ice</br>   fishing right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you would sit on the ice through a hole?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But it wasn't like a big snowmobile. It's called a SnoBear.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, I see. So they were special snowmobiles to go fishing?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. It would be like a van, and you will have the special thing</br>   like a snowmobile, and you will have three holes right here, but you would</br>   have the seat by the three holes, and three over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see. Did you get used to the cold then?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes, I got used to it. I mean, I lived there for a while. I lived</br>   there for three or four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, there were there other Mexicans who went snowmobiling and did</br>   all of this?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, pretty much it was Mexicans, Americans, because we would get</br>   along. Yeah, we would go. Even in, I still got friends from over there,</br>   they still go ice fishing, and they send me pictures still.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you stayed there for three years?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, from California, I stayed there three years. Then I came</br>   back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I went to work—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: At the fiberglass factory?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I get off from work, and I would have to drive around 45</br>   minutes. I got stopped by the stop sign, for the light, for the back-up</br>   light. It was a sheriff, and he just asked for the driver's license. I have</br>   only the permit license. So, he asked me for if I was a resident, if I</br>   could show any proof. I was honest with him. &quot;No, I'm not.&quot; So, he right</br>   away called Border Patrol.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year is this?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That was I think 2002? But from then, I already had a daughter</br>   right there. I was married.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were married to a Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: To a Chicana.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't get residency?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's another story. [laughs]. No, from there I got deported.</br>   They called Border Patrol. From Border Patrol, they told me that they will</br>   let me go, but I will have to go to court because I already had a daughter,</br>   and I was married, and I had a baby coming. So, from there, I went to court</br>   and everything. But when I went to court, they deported me. So, they gave</br>   me some time to come back to Mexico. So that's been, already, 11 years.</br>   They gave me papers, so I have to come back over here. I came back with my</br>   daughter, because my son, he was only three months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about your wife?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: She stayed over there. But we already made the papers, so we could</br>   fix the residence. But from then, I came over here, and this is a sad</br>   story. I came over here with my daughter, and she was with my son over</br>   there. She came over here, but she was pregnant from somebody else.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. So, from there, she came over here, we tried to fix things.</br>   It didn't work out. I mean, it worked out for a little bit. She went back</br>   to have the baby, and she took my daughter, and she left me my son. So, she</br>   left, and she had the baby, and from there, she didn't fix my papers</br>   anymore. I stayed with my son right here. Right now, I'm a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You're a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. My son is from over there, he's already 11 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He's living with you? He's an American.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He's an American. He's living with me. He lives right here; he</br>   goes to school right here. He's going to turn 12 years old next month. I</br>   can't take him back because he doesn't know his mom, and he doesn't want to</br>   know nothing about his mom. He wants to go back with my aunts, but it's</br>   kind of hard. He doesn't want to let me go. I want him to go over there,</br>   but he doesn't want to go without me, and I'm not going back without my</br>   papers. Illegally, I'm not going back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like for you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: It was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was hard?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. Because I didn't know my mom, because I left for so</br>   much time. I didn't know my brother and my sister because they never went</br>   over there. I came over here, I couldn't find a job. I didn't know how to</br>   work right here. It was everything different for us. Plus, because we had</br>   tattoos, they were kind of racist, like in the face. Because you got a</br>   tattoo, you cannot get a job. Then it was hard for me to find a job,</br>   because first of all, I didn't have all of my papers, like the security</br>   number that we have right here. So, I started working in a restaurant. From</br>   there, I started looking for other jobs. From there, I started working in a</br>   gas station. Whatever I will put the gas, and whatever they will give me,</br>   that's it. That would be what I get.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's it?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's it. Plus, I will have to pay to the gas station for me</br>   working there. Yeah. When you go right here, and you see the gas stations,</br>   the people that work there, they only work for the tips. They will have to</br>   still pay for that, to the gas station, to be working there. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Then from there, I met this person, on the metro. And I found</br>   TeleTech. I started working there. I worked for three years. I started at</br>   zero, by nothing. I didn't know anything about call centers. From there, I</br>   went to [inaudible] for nine months. From there, I stayed there for three</br>   years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What company do you work for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Right now, I started working for Alliance.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The insurance company?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The insurance company. I got like three weeks that I started</br>   there. But before that, I worked at AT&amp;amp;T.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I haven't started working. I worked three years for</br>   TeleTech. As soon as I finished with TeleTech, I went to AT&amp;amp;T. I was</br>   already hired, and then I quit over here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how long were you with AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: A year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did customer service for AT&amp;amp;T?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Customer service. I assume. I worked—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's my phone company.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Good luck. [laughs]. I mean, it's pretty good. As long as you know</br>   the terms and conditions, which we don't really read that much. That's what</br>   happens. We never read it. Sometimes they will call us, and they will call</br>   me and be like, &quot;No, but this guy told me this.&quot; &quot;Did you read the terms</br>   and conditions?&quot; &quot;No, but he tells me this.&quot; &quot;I'm sorry, but you have to</br>   check the terms and conditions.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what should I know about AT&amp;amp;T that I can be careful about?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Just pretty much check terms and conditions.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which terms and conditions? Tell me what I should know.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. Pretty much all the time when customers call, it's</br>   because they have a higher bill, pretty much it’s for that. When you have a</br>   higher bill because you don't got a discount, because all of the things</br>   will be for 12 months or 24 months. They give you another discounts, out of</br>   your bill, every month. You're getting another contract right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When people call you up really angry—like they call up, and some</br>   people are really angry on the phone—what do you do with them? Do you put</br>   them on mute?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, sometimes you listen to them. The first thing that you have</br>   to do—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You seem like such a calm person, so I'm asking you.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The first thing you will have to do is listen to them. Don't</br>   interrupt them. They don't want to hear what you have to tell them, so</br>   don't interrupt them. Let them talk. As soon as they finish, just be like,</br>   &quot;I'll be working on it. Let me check, let me repeat the information.&quot; They</br>   will calm down. As soon as they calm down, you will be like, &quot;Okay, I have</br>   to check what I can offer.&quot; If there is nothing you can offer, you will be</br>   like, &quot;Sorry, sir, there is nothing I can do, but this is what happened,&quot;</br>   and you're telling them everything. Why? Because he's – oh, that person is</br>   not going to yell at you because that person is now telling you everything.</br>   As soon as that point, when you can tell them, &quot;You know what? Your</br>   promotion is not available anymore.&quot; They will get upset –</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They'll accept it?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, sometimes. Other people will get upset, and will think that</br>   a manager or a supervisor, they will ask right away for them. They will</br>   think that they're going to fix everything. But no, they are more specific</br>   on the terms and conditions because they go by the book. So, when an agent</br>   tries to do everything, it's because he's trying. But when you request a</br>   manager, and you're requesting something that agent can't do, you're going</br>   to be denied.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it's better to stick with the agent?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, sometimes. Or sometimes say, &quot;I want to cancel.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I want to cancel.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Ah, is that the best thing?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, because you will go to retention, and they will get the</br>   right skills. It's because every department, they have different skills.</br>   The retention, what are they trying to do? The department of cancellations,</br>   what are they going to do? They have all of the promotions that the</br>   customer is happy for. They never tell you that the promotions, they will</br>   probably hook you up with another contract. Even though you don't say</br>   anything, but by you saying you want another discount, &quot;Okay, don't worry,</br>   I'm going to provide you a 12-month discount.&quot; You're hooked with that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So every time I call AT&amp;amp;T, they're always telling me, &quot;Can I</br>   tell you how we can give you a better ...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But with them, you have a script. They have a script, and</br>   you will have to follow the script. So, the best point is, &quot;You know what?</br>   I want to cancel.&quot; You will go with the department, and they will try to do</br>   anything to keep you as a customer.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. So, I'll never ask for a manager again.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, don't do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just say I want to cancel. This is good. But do you ever put them on</br>   mute and not listen?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Sometimes you have to put it on mute, so the customer can</br>   relax. There are some phones that you will have to let the client speak,</br>   even if you put it on mute, they will be like, &quot;No, I don't want you to go</br>   on mute.&quot; Or some people, &quot;Okay, take your time.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, I'm just wondering, does anyone ... I assume most of these calls</br>   are coming from the United States. Does anyone hear your accent and ever</br>   attack you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh yeah, all of the time. That's in every call center here. I</br>   mean, that happens all of the time, that when you talk to somebody, and</br>   they say, &quot;Oh, I don't want to talk to you. I want someone from the United</br>   States.&quot; The only thing that you control is, &quot;You know what? I'll transfer</br>   you to the IVR—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: To the what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: The IVR. &quot;But I won't promise you-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the IVR?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: When you call to customer service—</br> </br> </br>   Tim: An automated system.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. So that's when you will be like, &quot;You know what? Okay. I</br>   will transfer you to the IVR, but I won't promise you that you will be</br>   speaking with somebody from the United States.&quot; They will get upset and</br>   they will hang up. Other than that, you will tell them, &quot;If you want to</br>   talk with someone from the United States, you will have to go to the local</br>   office to do the process because pretty much all of the call centers are</br>   ... I mean, I'm working, right now, Alliance, I don't do any phone calls. I</br>   don't receive phone calls, it's pretty much back office. It's kind of</br>   different. But it's better, I think. It's less pay, but it's better.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that being in the United States, living there, that</br>   there are certain things that made you feel American in any way?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. Because there is one thing, and I'm going to put it</br>   that way. Thanksgiving. Yeah. For me, Thanksgiving is like something that I</br>   had to do on my own. First of all, at my house, they were like, &quot;What's</br>   this? Why you do this?&quot; I go, &quot;It's because I thank God because I have food</br>   on the table.&quot; That's something that we do every year. There’s some points,</br>   football, like baseball, basketball, things like that, that over here, they</br>   don't see it that way. But Thanksgiving, yes, it's something important.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="53dcde91-3138-4484-8073-b0337e148dff" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="American, Sports,  football">Anita: So, did you become an American football fan?<br>

   Rodrigo: Yes.<br>

   Rodrigo: Yes. Well, pretty much, I'm not a fan for one team only. I like<br>
   Vikings, I like the 49ers, and Oakland too—they have no difference to the<br>
   Raiders in Oakland, because the only difference is that bridge. But yes,<br>
   pretty much, I like a lot of teams that we used to do over there, that we<br>

From here, too, I've got some</br>   teams that I knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what about in your way of thinking? Do you think that there is</br>   anything American that's different about Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. I mean, it could be a lot of things. It would be the</br>   persons, the way I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Like you know, the way I think right here, sometimes people are</br>   really close. They don't see further than what Americans can see. Americans</br>   can have liberty to do more things, and Mexicans, they're all tight. They</br>   don't let you do things. That's the difference. For me, like with my son,</br>   he's, right now, he's going to graduate from primaria [elementary school].</br>   I let him go to sleep late. Some people, like my sisters, to their son,</br>   they don't see it that way. So that's something different. I let my son,</br>   with a cell phone. She's like, &quot;No, my son is not going to have a cell</br>   phone until he's older.&quot; That's a difference that we have.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: But I mean, I like it because I'm a single dad. I like to have</br>   communication with him, to be like, &quot;How are you? How is school?&quot; One of</br>   the things, I quit AT&amp;amp;T, that was one. It was far away from my house. I</br>   used to wake up at 4:40 in the morning. I used to be there before seven. I</br>   will get out around six, from AT&amp;amp;T, and I would be at home around, from</br>   eight to nine. That was from Monday to Friday. So, I didn't have time with</br>   my son. Now on the job that I have, I work from seven to three. I work from</br>   Monday to Friday. So, it's pretty good. But my son will go alone to the</br>   school, where I will have to pay a taxi, but I will go to pick him up out</br>   of school. That's something that helps me. I'm not making a lot of money</br>   like I used to. But I'd rather be with my son.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Does your son consider himself Mexican at all?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. He could be one Mexican, and he's completely the Mexican</br>   flag. He knows he's American, but he looks Mexican. If you will tell him,</br>   &quot;Yes, I am from the United States, but I'm from Mexico, too.&quot; He will be</br>   like, &quot;Mexico, Mexico.&quot; This is funny, because sometimes, when we had the</br>   soccer games, Mexico versus United States, we will be at home, and be like,</br>   &quot;A quien le vas?&quot; [who are you rooting for?] He will go, &quot;Mexico.&quot; That's</br>   funny, because that's something that we would play with him because we</br>   would tell him, &quot;But you're not Mexican. You have to go for the United</br>   States.&quot; He's like, &quot;No. I go for Mexico.&quot; But that's something—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who did you go for? Who did you root for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm not really into it, to the soccer. Whatever wins. I'm not used</br>   to it, to soccer games. I'm more used to—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But if somebody asked you to that soccer game? Para quien le va?</br>   [who are you rooting for?]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh, I would be like Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Even over there, I mean ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But I'm wondering, because your son came here so little, whether he</br>   might be more Mexican than you are in some ways.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Even though he's the American, and you're the Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know. That's something that I will tell him. My son doesn't</br>   speak English. Some people will say to me, &quot;Why you don't teach him?&quot; I</br>   mean, I teach him some words. He knows, like I tell him, &quot;Do your bed.&quot; He</br>   knows what I'm telling him. But he doesn’t know how to pronounce it. Why?</br>   Because at school, they only speak Spanish. They don't have an English</br>   class. He doesn't have nobody to talk English but me. I'm the only person.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In his way of thinking, is he more Mexican in some ways than you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, even the way that he talks sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The way that he talks, you said? Like what?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We call right here, we talk like Chilango, they have some</br>   different words. I'm from here, but I don't even talk that way. He talks</br>   that way. I'm like, &quot;Mijo, why you talk that way?&quot; I don't mind it, because</br>   he's a good boy. I'm not going to complain about him. Sometimes it's hard</br>   for me, because it's only me and him. Before, when he was a kid, I think he</br>   needed more of his mom. But now, we're getting there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old was he when he came here?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: One year old. Wow. So, he's an American citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who came here because you were deported, and although he's an</br>   American citizen, he's growing up in Mexico — I mean, he's a Mexican</br>   12-year-old.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. I mean, he pretty much, even on Independence Day—that's</br>   another thing that we celebrate here too. Him and me, on fourth of July, we</br>   celebrate. We do something. Everybody is like, &quot;Why you do this?&quot; There is</br>   something that people don't know. It's like Thanksgiving, too. People don't</br>   know why we celebrate that. But we celebrate it, because for me, because I</br>   used to do that, and I want him to keep doing it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So why is July 4th important to you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, we used to get all together, like family, and fireworks, and</br>   it was the long weekend, so we would go swimming, we would go to the river.</br>   In Minnesota, it was the river. In California, it was to the ocean, to the</br>   sea, to the bay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you do hotdogs and stuff on July 4th?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. Well, always, always, on Thanksgiving it was the turkey. On</br>   the side, they would make some Mexican food. Same thing on the Fourth of</br>   July. We would make some Mexican food.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, let me ask you just one final question about the deportation.</br>   Could you have done your papers earlier?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There was nothing you could have done?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: There was a period, because on the beginning, I had my interview,</br>   in Ciudad Juarez, but they asked me for a waiver. So, when they asked me</br>   for the waiver, I will have to reschedule another appointment. When that</br>   happens, she didn't really help me out anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But when you were still in the United States, did you delay?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. The processes, it takes too long. That's why they let me</br>   go—Immigration, when they got me, they let me go, because I was in the</br>   process for my papers. They told me to keep going to court.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you have any contact with your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old is she?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: She's 15. Not at all, her mom doesn't let her talk to me at all.</br>   Not even with my son. But I mean, life is good. What can I say? Before it</br>   was really hard, but now I'm used to it. I have to keep living with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You sound like an amazing dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm trying to. It's hard. Believe me. Two years ago, my mom passed</br>   away. So, she was the one that used to help me a lot. But now it got a</br>   little bit harder, because now he's getting a little bit older, and he's</br>   getting older, and the problems start.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. You don't have a partner?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. No, I'm single. [Laughs]. No, I mean, I used to have a</br>   girlfriend. But nothing else.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you for sharing your story.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, thank you to you. I wanted to talk. I mean, this is something</br>   that is like therapy, because it helps me. Yesterday, one of my friends</br>   came, and she was like, &quot;You need this. You need to go.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And? How do you feel now?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I like it. I like it a lot. It's something new. It's something</br>   that I'll let everything go at this moment.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You really sound like an incredible dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Thank you. I appreciate it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's very, very moving.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I appreciate it. I've been here for a lot of time. It’s tough to</br>   be a dad sometimes. Sometimes there is things that I want to do, but I</br>   can't because I have to be at home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You know, I've been hearing stories all day long, about kids who</br>   went, and their Mexican dads abandoned them.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, that won't happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm ending my day – You are helping me.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, I mean—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You are giving me—</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: One of the reasons that I will never do that, is because my dad,</br>   when he was in the states, he left me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad did it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He left me. From that, I was like, “No.” From that, I was like,</br>   &quot;No, I can't do that.&quot; I mean, I wouldn't do it. My son is my son, and</br>   he'll always be there.</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up on June 8, 2019</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Okay. Has the last year been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh. What's been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, first of all is because for some time I stayed without a</br>   job. Why? Because I was trying to ... For me to find a job is really hard</br>   because I had to be with him. At the same time, I had to take care of him</br>   from school, so for me it was really hard. So, I found a job, but it was</br>   two hours and a half from my house just to go. And to come back, it was two</br>   hours and a half. It was almost four to five hours, so I wouldn't have time</br>   for him. And not just to take him to the school, to help him to do</br>   homework. It's really hard. But I stayed without a job for two months.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: So right now, I found a really good job. I mean, it's really good.</br>   I work from Monday to Friday. It's 45 minutes away from my house, so it's</br>   really good. And then I got Saturdays and Sundays off.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: This is East Concourse Servicing. It's just a call center, but</br>   it's a collision agency. I mean, it's pretty good. I wouldn't say, I don't</br>   make a lot of money, but I'm getting there. It's close to my house. I will</br>   be able to take him to school, and then he will have to go from school to</br>   the house by himself. But I know that he went to the school. I know he will</br>   be there, and I got time for him because I only work nine hours.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You work nine hours per day?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. From Monday to Friday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are you being paid?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, right now, the gross pay is $8,000. I mean, 8,000 pesos. I'm</br>   sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: 8,000 pesos for ...</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Per month. Plus with that you have 2,000 pesos in vales de</br>   despensa, that’s what they call the food vouchers they give you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Plus 2,000?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo:</br> </br> </br>   Per month. Plus a bonus that we could get. We could get from 2,000 probably</br>   three or 4,000 more. All depends. And I mean, it's pretty good because I</br>   got time to spend with him on the weekends. He's getting older already. I</br>   mean, he's not a boy anymore. He's growing up, so I have to take care of</br>   more of him. I have to be more time with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are you worried about him?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are you worried about?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: About everything. I mean, to be really honest with you, I don't</br>   know, but if you go to one school from here from Mexico-</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo:</br> </br> </br>   I'm worried because sometimes you never know what could happen. Sometimes</br>   they could go to the ... On the way to the school, there's a lot of danger</br>   sometimes, even to cross the avenues. Some people, there's a lot of bad</br>   people around here, too, sometimes, no? So that's why I'm worried. That's</br>   why I'm always trying to get a good job, to have the money so we could</br>   survive. At the same time, so I could be able to be with him, too, when he</br>   needs. Right now, it takes me time, but the job that I have, it gives me</br>   the opportunity to do a lot of things with him. So that's what I want, and</br>   I want to stay with that job for a while. I mean, it's really good. I don't</br>   make as much money as before, but I will be able to be at home to cook for</br>   him, to do things with him. So that's something that I really wanted to do</br>   because it's only him and me. If we don't take care of each other, who's</br>   going to take care of us?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And do you ever think about him going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Last week ... I have another daughter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. I remember.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I don't know if you ever remember that I told you. She's going to</br>   be 17 already next year, so she didn't talk to me at all before. She</br>   started talking to me last Sunday. She was like, &quot;You know what? I want to</br>   go and visit you guys.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Great.&quot; Well, I was happy. It’s</br>   something that I would never expect. First of all, I never expect that</br>   phone call at all. Second of all, when she says, &quot;Well, I want to see you</br>   guys,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;I want to see you, too, Mija, but we had to wait for</br>   you to get the passport and everything.&quot; I know it's going to be a process</br>   and you know everything will cost money, but I will make it. Probably next</br>   year, she will be here, at least for a couple weeks, no?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: But, yes, I want him to get the passport and everything so he can</br>   go, too. Later on, I want to see if I could get my visa, just to go and</br>   visit them or just to take him to visit and so he will be able to know his</br>   country. Because, believe it or not, he wants to go and see. Sometimes he,</br>   like in the school, sometimes he gets racismo. I don't like it. I want him</br>   to go over there, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He gets racism because?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because he was born over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But how do they know?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: In the school and by the teacher, by one teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But how do they know? He doesn't speak a word of English.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know but everybody around there knows him. They know who he is,</br>   and they know me, too, and they're like, &quot;Well, he was born over there, but</br>   he doesn't speak English. But he's born over there. “Es el gringo.&quot; [he’s</br>   the gringo] I mean, that's how they tell him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what does he answer back? What do you answer?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] Cuando te dicen el gringo en la escuela o el maestro</br>   que te decia, que decias? [when they call you the gringo in school what do</br>   you say?]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: [inaudible]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pero que le decias? Es la pregunta. [what do you say? that’s the</br>   question]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: [inaudible]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He's always shy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I know. Except when he's dancing.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I know. [laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what is he saying? What does he tell you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: On the beginning, he got upset because we talk about it. I was</br>   like, &quot;You know what? If you want me, I will go and talk with that teacher</br>   to stop the bullying,&quot; because he's pretty much that. But he getting to</br>   swear me he doesn't care. He's like from here. He just, you know, nothing</br>   changes. It’s just like normal because he's been raised in here for almost</br>   all his life.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did your daughter get in touch with yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: By her grandma. I had her grandma in Facebook, and we talk</br>   sometimes, and she got ahold of me by phone. I was like, &quot;Great.&quot; I mean,</br>   it was for a long time that she wouldn't get in touch with me. She didn't</br>   even try to talk to me, and now she did. I'm like, &quot;Well, this is one step,</br>   no, towards –.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your friends with her grandma, which is your ex-wife's mother, on</br>   Facebook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I get along with them, except with the mom. I get along with both</br>   sisters, with both brothers, and with the grandma. I mean, we get along,</br>   but with her, we don't get in touch at all. I mean, she doesn't want to</br>   talk to me, and I mean, that's fine because she's already with somebody</br>   else. I respect that. Plus, I don't want to know anything about it either.</br>   But there's something, she don't want… It's because she doesn't want... She</br>   will want it. She will be like, &quot;You know what? I pay for the passport. She</br>   pays for this. We do this. We do that.&quot; So, he will be able to go over</br>   there, and my daughter will be able to come over there. We could be</br>   connected, but she doesn’t want to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She doesn't want to? But is she going to allow her daughter to come</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, that's the thing that we were planning. I mean, I was</br>   telling my daughter, &quot;Right now, I wish I could have the money to be like,</br>   'You know what? I'll send you for the passport. And I have the plane</br>   ticket.'&quot; But it's a process. I mean, I don't want to put things on the</br>   hurry. I want just to be little by little. Probably if not by when she will</br>   be 18, it will be different. Right now, this is one step. I know in one</br>   time she will be able to come and is sooner than before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When was the last time you saw her?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Oh, yeah. It has 11 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's been 11 years?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: It's been 11 years, and I want to see her already. I mean, I want</br>   to see her. I know she needs me, and I need her, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you spoken on FaceTime?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you see each other?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But, I mean, it's not the same. I wish it would be like I</br>   could have her here right here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Does she look like you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I will show you a picture right now. Let me see. Hold on. Let me</br>   see. She's really big, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's her name again?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: America Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: American-</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: America.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: America.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Natalie. Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, my daughter's name is Natalie. Did you know that? Did you say</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, I think you remember that you told me. Yeah, she's Natalie.</br>   I'm trying to find a picture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's a great name. You called her America?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. That's her name. I got some pictures, but ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So these guys are actually Roddy and ... Do you call her America or</br>   Natalie?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Natalie.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And Natalie are actually real sister?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, they're real brother.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And they're complete siblings, by blood?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: By blood. Yeah. They by blood. Oh, this one.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, wow. Is this her?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. She's pretty.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And she's really tall, they say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She looks like – Well, so are you.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: You think so?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She looks like you. She really does.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, and she's the big one. She's right now 16. She's going to be</br>   17.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. Well, that's great. So she Facebooked you once?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, I mean-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All of a sudden you got a message on Facebook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Saying, &quot;Hi, this is Natalie&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: &quot;Hi, Dad. This is Natalie.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Hi. How you doing? It</br>   was great to get to know you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It must have been.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. It was good. I mean, I wasn't – On Sunday, we were just</br>   watching TV, and then I just see my cellphone, and it says, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; And</br>   I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; Then I was like, &quot;Hey, how you doing, and how you been?&quot;</br>   And that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Pretending for it not to be a big deal, but of course.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, and it was good. I mean, because I know her mom wasn't</br>   around, so she will be able to talk to me to tell me more things. Because</br>   on the last times when I talked to her, it was like, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; &quot;How you</br>   doing?&quot; &quot;Oh, hi. How are you?” “Bye.&quot; That's it. She wouldn't be able to</br>   tell me, &quot;Hey, this is what's happening over here. I miss you. I want to</br>   go,&quot; or something like that. It's a good start.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she said those things?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Now, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And has she talked to [gestures to Roddy]</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. [to Roddy] ¿Si, verdad que hablaste con Natalie también?</br>   [you talked to Natalie too, right?]</br> </br> </br>   Roddy: ¿Que?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] ¿Hablaste con Natalie? [you talked to Natalie?] [to</br>   Anita] I mean, but the difference between them is that we have one issue.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Language.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He doesn't speak English, and she doesn't speak Spanish. So, I</br>   mean, he may understand a little bit, but some words and something. It's</br>   all the same thing. She may know some Spanish and words, but that's it. So,</br>   it's kind of strange. I mean, she doesn't speak Spanish, and he doesn't</br>   speak English.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And it happens. I mean, but we're fine, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well, that's fantastic news. I'm just going to ask you. The most</br>   difficult challenges you faced this year was finding a job?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Losing my job and finding a job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Over the years, things have gotten better, though?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, yeah. I mean, yes. The only thing is that when you don't</br>   have a job, that's a little bit hard. But then when you start working, you</br>   start getting on your feet. You start on the track again, but we're getting</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you know about programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not really. No, because even right here if you check, they have</br>   help for madres solteras, [single mothers] but it won't happen to me</br>   because I'm a single dad. I won't qualify for that. I mean, sometimes it</br>   will be great just because you will get benefits like programs where they</br>   can go and do some sports or something like that. But I don't apply, and he</br>   won't apply either because he's not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, let me just finish this. We ask which of your relatives live in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: My brother and my sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. Siblings. Are you in touch with them?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We live together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, so you live with your brother and sister?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: We live together in the same house. Like everybody has his own</br>   part, but I mean, everybody – they have to go to work. They have their own</br>   families, so sometimes, even though they help you out and we help each</br>   other, but sometimes you have to do things because they got other things to</br>   do, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Would you consider going back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because I grew up over there, and to be honest with you, I miss a</br>   lot over there. I know I could do more things over there than over here,</br>   but you know one of the things that I don't want to go illegally, not</br>   anymore. I mean, I want to go legally, and I know it may take some time.</br>   But I could do it because my son and my daughter, they're from over there.</br>   They will be able to get my papers fixed. When that happens, I want to be</br>   able to go legally, and I want to go to work, do some things. Like how it</br>   was my American dream back when I was over there. Right here, I won't say</br>   that. At the beginning, when I got here, I didn't know nobody. It was</br>   really hard. I got in depression and a lot of things, but now, I mean, I'm</br>   living day by day, and I have to like it. I'm okay now. But, yes, I will go</br>   back one day. But I want to go legally, not illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And one question is do you think that the US government has</br>   responsibility for Roddy?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: In some parts, I think, but they won't do anything. I mean, to be</br>   really honest with you, they never going to do anything because they have</br>   so many people over there. It's not just Americans. It's not Mexicans. It's</br>   everybody. It's all the Latin people, all the people from Europe or from</br>   Africa. There's a lot of immigrants from over there, and they, some of</br>   them, they already born over there. So, they're Americans, too. They don't</br>   even receive help.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what about Roddy being here. What kind of responsibilities –</br>   What do you think the US government should do to help Roddy?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, what I would like is probably just to help him with medical.</br>   That would be all. I mean, because over there, they give you that – How's</br>   it called? That program that they give you meals and all that?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And they give you benefits. Well, for that, I mean, I work for it,</br>   and we used to pay our own things with your own work. But, I mean, I</br>   wouldn't ask for money. The only thing that I would ask is for medical</br>   assistance for him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about for his school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: And schooling. Yeah. And that's one of the things, too, because on</br>   the future, one of the things that I want him sooner or later for him to go</br>   back is because I want him to go to school over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He's got to learn English.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. So right now, my goal up to this point is I want him to go</br>   to an English school, and that's my new goal. I won't be able to do it in</br>   this month, but probably next month, he will start doing English. And not</br>   because I don't want to. It's because we need money to do all the process,</br>   too. I'm starting my track and probably not this paycheck, I can’t do it,</br>   but next paycheck, next month, I will be able to do it. And that's</br>   something that I really want to do because, to be really honest, I probably</br>   just want to stay probably right here one or two years more, and he may go</br>   back. That's something that I have. I want him to go to high school over</br>   there, just out of high school to go to college, so he could start the</br>   school over there already.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And would his mother – could he live with his mother?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. No. I grew up in California, and I got a lot of aunts for my</br>   mom's side. So, they will be able to take care of him, and plus, that's my</br>   other goal, too. For next years, I want to try to apply for my visa. I</br>   mean, I don't have no bad records at all over there. I didn't do anything</br>   wrong over there. I came over here to fix my papers. I have everything, but</br>   it didn't happen. So, I never tried to come back illegally, so I want to go</br>   and try to get my visa. If I get it, good. If not, I'm just going to wait</br>   for him to get my papers fixed. So that's my dream. I wish it will be done,</br>   but we will try.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Those are great dreams. That's great dreams. Let me stop now<span id="764ebe75-8467-4a43-af21-96e9d7086537" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Employment, Opportunity"></span>ita: Is that the first time you saw snow?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. One time I was right here, by ___, that was the first time</br>   that I see a lot of snow. Then I went to the school, and it was really,</br>   really hard for me because I couldn't say, &quot;May I go to the restroom?&quot; I</br>   couldn't check anything. The first day for me was horrible. Because I</br>   didn't know English. I didn't know anybody. I was a really different person</br>   than the students from there. They just looked at me like, &quot;Who are you?&quot;</br>   Some people would talk to me, and I was like [gestures] with signs. Then</br>   they put me with a tutor. It was just pretty much, all the year, I stayed</br>   with the tutor all the time, just learning English.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tutor nice?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I still remember she was nice to me. Then from there, I</br>   pretty much, I didn't learn a lot, but I learned how to ask for food, to go</br>   to the restroom. Small things. That was in the beginning. Then from</br>   there—that was in 8th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: 8th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because when I started over there, I was in 8th grade. Then from</br>   there, I moved to my aunt’s because my dad left me over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, your dad took you over?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: He took me over, but then he left me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he go?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: To Texas. And then he went to Texas, and from there, we haven't</br>   talked since then.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You haven't talked until today, with your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Until today, I haven't. He found somebody else, and he got</br>   married, I guess. He just forgot about me. So, I started living with my</br>   mom's side of the family, with my aunts, and my grandma and grandpa. They</br>   would help me a lot. Then from there, from Minnesota, they wanted to move</br>   to California. So we moved to California. I started high school, 9th grade</br>   to 12th grade, in California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I don't know if you know the Central Valley area. It's a small</br>   town, it's called _________, California. Pretty much all of my family lives</br>   there, and around there. My mom had a big family. There were like 13</br>   brothers in total. So, it was a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So why Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because they live over there. To be honest with you, one of the</br>   reasons that now I get it is because in Minnesota, they didn't have a lot</br>   of Hispanic people. So, when you apply over there to get an</br>   immigration—because my aunts, they were trying to get the residential for</br>   my uncles, for their husbands—it was more faster for them to do it over</br>   there. So, they moved over there. Then they started buying houses. That's</br>   why we stayed there, for a while. Then they come back to California when</br>   they get their papers, and some of my uncles, they stay in Minnesota, and</br>   some, they stay in California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So, was California better than Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much, yes, and no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I have to be honest with you, in California, there were more Latin</br>   people, more Hispanic people, more Mexicans. I will say that, where we</br>   live. It was easier for me because they have more programs on the high</br>   school to learn English. We have the ESL, ESL one, ESL two, ESL three. That</br>   helped me a lot. It was better because I was used to being always at home</br>   back in Minnesota, and over here, not, because it was more sunny. It was</br>   better. It was more familiar with Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how many years were you in Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's another story. I stayed in Minnesota for six, nine months</br>   in the beginning. Then I moved to California, and as soon as I finished the</br>   high school, I moved to Minnesota again.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you move back to Minnesota?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Because I finished high school, and I couldn't go to the college,</br>   because I didn't have a social security number. So, I didn't have a way to</br>   keep studying. I had to work. The only work that they have over there, it</br>   was pretty much for people that don't have papers, was the fields. I didn't</br>   have a way to – a car or something to move.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the fields at all?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. On the summer. Summer I used to work on the fields, just two</br>   or three weeks, just to get some money to buy my clothes for the new year.</br>   So that's what I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what did you do in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Picking onions, and the cotton.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Cotton?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In the Central Valley?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: In the Central Valley area. That's what I did. It was not a lot. I</br>   didn't work, like I say. I used to work for three weeks, and then from</br>   there, I would be at home. Just to get some money to buy my clothes for the</br>   new year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, when you worked in the fields, you worked with other Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who were working full-time?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was that? Did they say, &quot;You lucky kid, you're going to school?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No. Pretty much, I used to work with my aunts. One of my aunts,</br>   the one that raised me, she would go with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She worked in the fields?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. She would go with me, and she would take a look at me, keep</br>   an eye on me, just so nothing happens, because, you know, the border patrol</br>   and immigration would go in the fields. So, she always was there for me.</br>   She's like the main [inaudible].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year is this in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I'm talking about '98 to 2001.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, your aunts really wanted you to finish school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Pretty much, I grew up with them. My mom was here in Mexico.</br>   But pretty much, they helped me a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did they have children of their own?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yes, my cousins, my little cousins. They're not little</br>   anymore. I'm like the big brother for them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much older were you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I was 15 when I moved to California.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. They were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: They were like five, three, two. They were not old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In California, were your friends mainly Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. First of all, it was Mexicans. Then when I started getting to</br>   know them a little bit more, and then started speaking more English, then I</br>   started getting Mexicans that were born there, they’re called Chicanos.</br>   Other Mexicans. Pretty much, it was Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any friends that weren't Chicano or Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much in the beginning it was Mexicans. Then after that, it</br>   was more Chicanos too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about others?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Not really. Not in California. It's because pretty much all of the</br>   people are Mexican or Chicano. You could find some other kinds of people,</br>   but that's ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about school? Were there other kind of people at school? Or was</br>   everybody at school Mexican or Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No, I mean, it was ... How can I say it? Because I didn't know</br>   enough English. They would put you aside. Not aside, but they would put</br>   you, &quot;Okay, you don't talk English, you have to go to ESL class.&quot; &quot;Okay,</br>   you're American, you're fine, you went to English class.&quot; It was different</br>   because all of the Mexicans, that we didn't know English, we were all in</br>   the same classes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about Central Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I didn't have that many right there in California. It was probably</br>   a field thing, from Guatemala. It was probably a few, like five, it wasn't</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, so you couldn't find a job that wouldn't have been in the</br>   fields after finishing high school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: After finishing high school. Then from there, I moved back to</br>   Minnesota. In Minnesota, that's when I started working in a fiberglass</br>   company. We used to make snowmobiles, all of that kind of parts. Even the</br>   front end from the buses, they are made from fiberglass. Even parts for</br>   airplanes. We used to make them, because they're made of fiberglass. That's</br>   where I knew more English. That's when I started getting along with white</br>   people. Right there, I met more Central American people. That was more</br>   different, because over there, there is not a lot of Mexicans. So that's</br>   where I learned more skills in English. At the same time, how they lived.</br>   White people, how they lived, black people, how they lived. We will see a</br>   few black people there. But we will see Indian people, how they lived.</br>   Bosnian people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was different about the way that the white people lived to the</br>   way the Mexicans lived?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, pretty much it depends on the persons because you could find</br>   a racist person, or you could find a person that tried to be a Mexican—or</br>   not to be a Mexican but get someone with Mexicans. That's when you compared</br>   those persons. Because some people, they don't care, they just see you, and</br>   some persons, they want to know how you lived, how everything goes. Some</br>   persons, they don't even care about you. When that happens, I got to know a</br>   lot of American people. We used to get along. I will say that they were my</br>   best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. At that point, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to Mexican restaurants? What did you do with them? How</br>   did you hang out with these people?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Pretty much, they were from work. On the weekends, we didn't work</br>   on Saturday and Sunday. So sometimes they would show up at the house, and</br>   we will cook out. Even sometimes the weather wouldn't let us, we would</br>   cookout in the garage. That's something that we would do.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you cook?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Everything. I mean, even they tried carnitas, carne asada.</br>   [grilled meat] I don’t know if you know tripa [intestine]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. They tried tripa?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. One of my best friends, he loves guacamole. It was something</br>   new for them at that time because it was like nobody knew that guacamole</br>   was avocado. It was something new for them. He would love that. He would</br>   always be like, &quot;I brought some chips, you make the guacamole.&quot; He will</br>   show up at the house, and we will make it. He would get along with my</br>   aunts, with my uncles. He was like a part of the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food did he cook for you? Did they cook for you too?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They just wanted Mexican food.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. His food was pizza, that was all. Pizzas and hamburgers.</br>   Sometimes we would be like, &quot;Let's go out to eat.&quot; &quot;Yeah, let's go.&quot; He</br>   would go, &quot;No, I want some pizza. I want some hamburgers.&quot; I would be like,</br>   &quot;Let's go to my house, let's see what thing we can make.&quot; One thing he</br>   would love, it was tinga. I don't know if you know—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes, I know what tinga is. My favorite tacos.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. We would make it—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: With chicken?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, with chicken, and onions, and chipotle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It's very good. Did you ever go in a snowmobile while you were</br>   there?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, I went on the snowmobile, ice fishing. We would go to</br>   the rivers, and sometimes, especially over there, the ice would be this</br>   much. So, you could close the river and everything. We would go in a</br>   snowmobile. Where I used to work, we made something that is called a</br>   SnoBear. That's like for people that like to go snowmobile, or to go ice</br>   fishing. Sorry. So you got six holes, three in this side, and three in the</br>   other side. You would have a seat for each one. Then you would just go ice</br>   fishing right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you would sit on the ice through a hole?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. But it wasn't like a big snowmobile. It's called a SnoBear.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, I see. So they were special snowmobiles to go fishing?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. It would be like a van, and you will have the special thing</br>   like a snowmobile, and you will have three holes right here, but you would</br>   have the seat by the three holes, and three over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see. Did you get used to the cold then?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes, I got used to it. I mean, I lived there for a while. I lived</br>   there for three or four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, there were there other Mexicans who went snowmobiling and did</br>   all of this?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah, pretty much it was Mexicans, Americans, because we would get</br>   along. Yeah, we would go. Even in, I still got friends from over there,</br>   they still go ice fishing, and they send me pictures still.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you stayed there for three years?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Well, from California, I stayed there three years. Then I came</br>   back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: I went to work—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: At the fiberglass factory?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. I get off from work, and I would have to drive around 45</br>   minutes. I got stopped by the stop sign, for the light, for the back-up</br>   light. It was a sheriff, and he just asked for the driver's license. I have</br>   only the permit license. So, he asked me for if I was a resident, if I</br>   could show any proof. I was honest with him. &quot;No, I'm not.&quot; So, he right</br>   away called Border Patrol.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year is this?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That was I think 2002? But from then, I already had a daughter</br>   right there. I was married.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were married to a Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: To a Chicana.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't get residency?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: That's another story. [laughs]. No, from there I got deported.</br>   They called Border Patrol. From Border Patrol, they told me that they will</br>   let me go, but I will have to go to court because I already had a daughter,</br>   and I was married, and I had a baby coming. So, from there, I went to court</br>   and everything. But when I went to court, they deported me. So, they gave</br>   me some time to come back to Mexico. So that's been, already, 11 years.</br>   They gave me papers, so I have to come back over here. I came back with my</br>   daughter, because my son, he was only three months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about your wife?</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: She stayed over there. But we already made the papers, so we could</br>   fix the residence. But from then, I came over here, and this is a sad</br>   story. I came over here with my daughter, and she was with my son over</br>   there. She came over here, but she was pregnant from somebody else.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yes. So, from there, she came over here, we tried to fix things.</br>   It didn't work out. I mean, it worked out for a little bit. She went back</br>   to have the baby, and she took my daughter, and she left me my son. So, she</br>   left, and she had the baby, and from there, she didn't fix my papers</br>   anymore. I stayed with my son right here. Right now, I'm a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You're a single dad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodrigo: Yeah. My son is from over there, he's already 11 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He's living with you? He's an American.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="5aa21439-5f90-444b-a261-e3717cef978c" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Deportation, Children, Family Separation">Rodrigo: He's an American.

   can't take him back because he doesn't know his mom, and he doesn't want to<br>

   reasons that now I get it is because in Minnesota, they didn't have a lot<br>
   of Hispanic people. So, when you apply over there to get an<br>
   immigration—because my aunts, they were trying to get the residential for<br>
   my uncles, for their husbands—it was more faster for them to do it over<br>
   there. So, they moved over there. Then they started buying houses. That's<br>
   why we stayed there, for a while. Then they come back to California when<br>
   they get their papers, and some of my uncles, they stay in Minnesota, and<br>
   some, they stay in California.<br>

   people, more Hispanic people, more Mexicans. I will say that, where we<br>
   live. It was easier for me because they have more programs on the high<br>
   school to learn English. We have the ESL, ESL one, ESL two, ESL three. That<br>
   helped me a lot. It was better because I was used to being always at home<br>
   back in Minnesota, and over here, not, because it was more sunny. It was<br>
   better. It was more familiar with Mexico.<br>
 <br>

   really hard for me because I couldn't say, &quot;May I go to the restroom?&quot; I<br>
   couldn't check anything. The first day for me was horrible. Because I<br>
   didn't know English. I didn't know anybody. I was a really different person<br>
   than the students from there. They just looked at me like, &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
   Some people would talk to me, and I was like [gestures] with signs. Then<br>
   they put me with a tutor. It was just pretty much, all the year, I stayed<br>
   with the tutor all the time, just learning English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Was the tutor nice?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. I still remember she was nice to me. Then from there, I<br>
   pretty much, I didn't learn a lot, but I learned how to ask for food, to go<br>
   to the restroom. Small things. That was in the beginning. Then from<br>
   there—that was in 8th grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: 8th grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Because when I started over there, I was in 8th grade. Then from<br>
   there, I moved to my aunt’s because my dad left me over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, your dad took you over?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: He took me over, but then he left me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Where did he go?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: To Texas. And then he went to Texas, and from there, we haven't<br>
   talked since then.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You haven't talked until today, with your dad?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Until today, I haven't. He found somebody else, and he got<br>
   married, I guess. He just forgot about me. So, I started living with my<br>
   mom's side of the family, with my aunts, and my grandma and grandpa. They<br>
   would help me a lot. Then from there, from Minnesota, they wanted to move<br>
   to California. So we moved to California. I started high school, 9th grade<br>
   to 12th grade, in California.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Where in California?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I don't know if you know the Central Valley area. It's a small<br>
   town, it's called _________, California. Pretty much all of my family lives<br>
   there, and around there. My mom had a big family. There were like 13<br>
   brothers in total. So, it was a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So why Minnesota?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Because they live over there. To be honest with you, one of the<br>
   reasons that now I get it is because in Minnesota, they didn't have a lot<br>
   of Hispanic people. So, when you apply over there to get an<br>
   immigration—because my aunts, they were trying to get the residential for<br>
   my uncles, for their husbands—it was more faster for them to do it over<br>
   there. So, they moved over there. Then they started buying houses. That's<br>
   why we stayed there, for a while. Then they come back to California when<br>
   they get their papers, and some of my uncles, they stay in Minnesota, and<br>
   some, they stay in California.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Wow. So, was California better than Minnesota?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Pretty much, yes, and no.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I have to be honest with you, in California, there were more Latin<br>
   people, more Hispanic people, more Mexicans. I will say that, where we<br>
   live. It was easier for me because they have more programs on the high<br>
   school to learn English. We have the ESL, ESL one, ESL two, ESL three. That<br>
   helped me a lot. It was better because I was used to being always at home<br>
   back in Minnesota, and over here, not, because it was more sunny. It was<br>
   better. It was more familiar with Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So how many years were you in Minnesota?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: That's another story. I stayed in Minnesota for six, nine months<br>
   in the beginning. Then I moved to California, and as soon as I finished the<br>
   high school, I moved to Minnesota again.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why did you move back to Minnesota?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Because I finished high school, and I couldn't go to the college,<br>
   because I didn't have a social security number. So, I didn't have a way to<br>
   keep studying. I had to work. The only work that they have over there, it<br>
   was pretty much for people that don't have papers, was the fields. I didn't<br>
   have a way to – a car or something to move.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you work in the fields at all?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. On the summer. Summer I used to work on the fields, just two<br>
   or three weeks, just to get some money to buy my clothes for the new year.<br>
   So that's what I did.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So what did you do in the fields?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Picking onions, and the cotton.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Cotton?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: In the Central Valley?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: In the Central Valley area. That's what I did. It was not a lot. I<br>
   didn't work, like I say. I used to work for three weeks, and then from<br>
   there, I would be at home. Just to get some money to buy my clothes for the<br>
   new year.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, when you worked in the fields, you worked with other Mexicans?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Who were working full-time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How was that? Did they say, &quot;You lucky kid, you're going to school?&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No. Pretty much, I used to work with my aunts. One of my aunts,<br>
   the one that raised me, she would go with me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: She worked in the fields?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. She would go with me, and she would take a look at me, keep<br>
   an eye on me, just so nothing happens, because, you know, the border patrol<br>
   and immigration would go in the fields. So, she always was there for me.<br>
   She's like the main [inaudible].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What year is this in California?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I'm talking about '98 to 2001.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, your aunts really wanted you to finish school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Pretty much, I grew up with them. My mom was here in Mexico.<br>
   But pretty much, they helped me a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did they have children of their own?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yes, my cousins, my little cousins. They're not little<br>
   anymore. I'm like the big brother for them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How much older were you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I was 15 when I moved to California.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Wow. They were how old?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: They were like five, three, two. They were not old.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: In California, were your friends mainly Mexicans?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. First of all, it was Mexicans. Then when I started getting to<br>
   know them a little bit more, and then started speaking more English, then I<br>
   started getting Mexicans that were born there, they’re called Chicanos.<br>
   Other Mexicans. Pretty much, it was Mexicans.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you have any friends that weren't Chicano or Mexican?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Pretty much in the beginning it was Mexicans. Then after that, it<br>
   was more Chicanos too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What about others?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Not really. Not in California. It's because pretty much all of the<br>
   people are Mexican or Chicano. You could find some other kinds of people,<br>
   but that's ...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What about school? Were there other kind of people at school? Or was<br>
   everybody at school Mexican or Chicano?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No, I mean, it was ... How can I say it? Because I didn't know<br>
   enough English. They would put you aside. Not aside, but they would put<br>
   you, &quot;Okay, you don't talk English, you have to go to ESL class.&quot; &quot;Okay,<br>
   you're American, you're fine, you went to English class.&quot; It was different<br>
   because all of the Mexicans, that we didn't know English, we were all in<br>
   the same classes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What about Central Americans?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I didn't have that many right there in California. It was probably<br>
   a field thing, from Guatemala. It was probably a few, like five, it wasn't<br>
   a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Okay, so you couldn't find a job that wouldn't have been in the<br>
   fields after finishing high school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: After finishing high school. Then from there, I moved back to<br>
   Minnesota. In Minnesota, that's when I started working in a fiberglass<br>
   company. We used to make snowmobiles, all of that kind of parts. Even the<br>
   front end from the buses, they are made from fiberglass. Even parts for<br>
   airplanes. We used to make them, because they're made of fiberglass. That's<br>
   where I knew more English. That's when I started getting along with white<br>
   people. Right there, I met more Central American people. That was more<br>
   different, because over there, there is not a lot of Mexicans. So that's<br>
   where I learned more skills in English. At the same time, how they lived.<br>
   White people, how they lived, black people, how they lived. We will see a<br>
   few black people there. But we will see Indian people, how they lived.<br>
   Bosnian people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What was different about the way that the white people lived to the<br>
   way the Mexicans lived?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, pretty much it depends on the persons because you could find<br>
   a racist person, or you could find a person that tried to be a Mexican—or<br>
   not to be a Mexican but get someone with Mexicans. That's when you compared<br>
   those persons. Because some people, they don't care, they just see you, and<br>
   some persons, they want to know how you lived, how everything goes. Some<br>
   persons, they don't even care about you. When that happens, I got to know a<br>
   lot of American people. We used to get along. I will say that they were my<br>
   best friends.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Americans?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. At that point, yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you go to Mexican restaurants? What did you do with them? How<br>
   did you hang out with these people?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Pretty much, they were from work. On the weekends, we didn't work<br>
   on Saturday and Sunday. So sometimes they would show up at the house, and<br>
   we will cook out. Even sometimes the weather wouldn't let us, we would<br>
   cookout in the garage. That's something that we would do.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What did you cook?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Everything. I mean, even they tried carnitas, carne asada.<br>
   [grilled meat] I don’t know if you know tripa [intestine]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yes. They tried tripa?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. One of my best friends, he loves guacamole. It was something<br>
   new for them at that time because it was like nobody knew that guacamole<br>
   was avocado. It was something new for them. He would love that. He would<br>
   always be like, &quot;I brought some chips, you make the guacamole.&quot; He will<br>
   show up at the house, and we will make it. He would get along with my<br>
   aunts, with my uncles. He was like a part of the family.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What food did he cook for you? Did they cook for you too?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: They just wanted Mexican food.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. His food was pizza, that was all. Pizzas and hamburgers.<br>
   Sometimes we would be like, &quot;Let's go out to eat.&quot; &quot;Yeah, let's go.&quot; He<br>
   would go, &quot;No, I want some pizza. I want some hamburgers.&quot; I would be like,<br>
   &quot;Let's go to my house, let's see what thing we can make.&quot; One thing he<br>
   would love, it was tinga. I don't know if you know—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yes, I know what tinga is. My favorite tacos.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. We would make it—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: With chicken?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, with chicken, and onions, and chipotle.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: It's very good. Did you ever go in a snowmobile while you were<br>
   there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, I went on the snowmobile, ice fishing. We would go to<br>
   the rivers, and sometimes, especially over there, the ice would be this<br>
   much. So, you could close the river and everything. We would go in a<br>
   snowmobile. Where I used to work, we made something that is called a<br>
   SnoBear. That's like for people that like to go snowmobile, or to go ice<br>
   fishing. Sorry. So you got six holes, three in this side, and three in the<br>
   other side. You would have a seat for each one. Then you would just go ice<br>
   fishing right there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you would sit on the ice through a hole?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. But it wasn't like a big snowmobile. It's called a SnoBear.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Oh, I see. So they were special snowmobiles to go fishing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. It would be like a van, and you will have the special thing<br>
   like a snowmobile, and you will have three holes right here, but you would<br>
   have the seat by the three holes, and three over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: I see. Did you get used to the cold then?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes, I got used to it. I mean, I lived there for a while. I lived<br>
   there for three or four years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, there were there other Mexicans who went snowmobiling and did<br>
   all of this?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, pretty much it was Mexicans, Americans, because we would get<br>
   along. Yeah, we would go. Even in, I still got friends from over there,<br>
   they still go ice fishing, and they send me pictures still.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you stayed there for three years?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, from California, I stayed there three years. Then I came<br>
   back.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How did you come back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I got deported.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I went to work—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: At the fiberglass factory?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. I get off from work, and I would have to drive around 45<br>
   minutes. I got stopped by the stop sign, for the light, for the back-up<br>
   light. It was a sheriff, and he just asked for the driver's license. I have<br>
   only the permit license. So, he asked me for if I was a resident, if I<br>
   could show any proof. I was honest with him. &quot;No, I'm not.&quot; So, he right<br>
   away called Border Patrol.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Really?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What year is this?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: That was I think 2002? But from then, I already had a daughter<br>
   right there. I was married.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You were married to a Mexican?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: To a Chicana.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You didn't get residency?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: That's another story. [laughs]. No, from there I got deported.<br>
   They called Border Patrol. From Border Patrol, they told me that they will<br>
   let me go, but I will have to go to court because I already had a daughter,<br>
   and I was married, and I had a baby coming. So, from there, I went to court<br>
   and everything. But when I went to court, they deported me. So, they gave<br>
   me some time to come back to Mexico. So that's been, already, 11 years.<br>
   They gave me papers, so I have to come back over here. I came back with my<br>
   daughter, because my son, he was only three months.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What about your wife?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: She stayed over there. But we already made the papers, so we could<br>
   fix the residence. But from then, I came over here, and this is a sad<br>
   story. I came over here with my daughter, and she was with my son over<br>
   there. She came over here, but she was pregnant from somebody else.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. So, from there, she came over here, we tried to fix things.<br>
   It didn't work out. I mean, it worked out for a little bit. She went back<br>
   to have the baby, and she took my daughter, and she left me my son. So, she<br>
   left, and she had the baby, and from there, she didn't fix my papers<br>
   anymore. I stayed with my son right here. Right now, I'm a single dad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You're a single dad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. My son is from over there, he's already 11 years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: He's living with you? He's an American.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: He's an American. He's living with me. He lives right here; he<br>
   goes to school right here. He's going to turn 12 years old next month. I<br>
   can't take him back because he doesn't know his mom, and he doesn't want to<br>
   know nothing about his mom. He wants to go back with my aunts, but it's<br>
   kind of hard. He doesn't want to let me go. I want him to go over there,<br>
   but he doesn't want to go without me, and I'm not going back without my<br>
   papers. Illegally, I'm not going back.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What was it like for you when you came back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: It was really hard.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What was hard?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Everything. Because I didn't know my mom, because I left for so<br>
   much time. I didn't know my brother and my sister because they never went<br>
   over there. I came over here, I couldn't find a job. I didn't know how to<br>
   work right here. It was everything different for us. Plus, because we had<br>
   tattoos, they were kind of racist, like in the face. Because you got a<br>
   tattoo, you cannot get a job. Then it was hard for me to find a job,<br>
   because first of all, I didn't have all of my papers, like the security<br>
   number that we have right here. So, I started working in a restaurant. From<br>
   there, I started looking for other jobs. From there, I started working in a<br>
   gas station. Whatever I will put the gas, and whatever they will give me,<br>
   that's it. That would be what I get.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: That's it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: That's it. Plus, I will have to pay to the gas station for me<br>
   working there. Yeah. When you go right here, and you see the gas stations,<br>
   the people that work there, they only work for the tips. They will have to<br>
   still pay for that, to the gas station, to be working there. Everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Then from there, I met this person, on the metro. And I found<br>
   TeleTech. I started working there. I worked for three years. I started at<br>
   zero, by nothing. I didn't know anything about call centers. From there, I<br>
   went to [inaudible] for nine months. From there, I stayed there for three<br>
   years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What company do you work for?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Right now, I started working for Alliance.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: The insurance company?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: The insurance company. I got like three weeks that I started<br>
   there. But before that, I worked at AT&amp;amp;T.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: AT&amp;amp;T?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. I haven't started working. I worked three years for<br>
   TeleTech. As soon as I finished with TeleTech, I went to AT&amp;amp;T. I was<br>
   already hired, and then I quit over here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So how long were you with AT&amp;amp;T?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: A year.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You did customer service for AT&amp;amp;T?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Customer service. I assume. I worked—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: That's my phone company.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Good luck. [laughs]. I mean, it's pretty good. As long as you know<br>
   the terms and conditions, which we don't really read that much. That's what<br>
   happens. We never read it. Sometimes they will call us, and they will call<br>
   me and be like, &quot;No, but this guy told me this.&quot; &quot;Did you read the terms<br>
   and conditions?&quot; &quot;No, but he tells me this.&quot; &quot;I'm sorry, but you have to<br>
   check the terms and conditions.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, what should I know about AT&amp;amp;T that I can be careful about?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Just pretty much check terms and conditions.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Which terms and conditions? Tell me what I should know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Everything. Pretty much all the time when customers call, it's<br>
   because they have a higher bill, pretty much it’s for that. When you have a<br>
   higher bill because you don't got a discount, because all of the things<br>
   will be for 12 months or 24 months. They give you another discounts, out of<br>
   your bill, every month. You're getting another contract right there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: When people call you up really angry—like they call up, and some<br>
   people are really angry on the phone—what do you do with them? Do you put<br>
   them on mute?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, sometimes you listen to them. The first thing that you have<br>
   to do—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You seem like such a calm person, so I'm asking you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: The first thing you will have to do is listen to them. Don't<br>
   interrupt them. They don't want to hear what you have to tell them, so<br>
   don't interrupt them. Let them talk. As soon as they finish, just be like,<br>
   &quot;I'll be working on it. Let me check, let me repeat the information.&quot; They<br>
   will calm down. As soon as they calm down, you will be like, &quot;Okay, I have<br>
   to check what I can offer.&quot; If there is nothing you can offer, you will be<br>
   like, &quot;Sorry, sir, there is nothing I can do, but this is what happened,&quot;<br>
   and you're telling them everything. Why? Because he's – oh, that person is<br>
   not going to yell at you because that person is now telling you everything.<br>
   As soon as that point, when you can tell them, &quot;You know what? Your<br>
   promotion is not available anymore.&quot; They will get upset –<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: They'll accept it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, sometimes. Other people will get upset, and will think that<br>
   a manager or a supervisor, they will ask right away for them. They will<br>
   think that they're going to fix everything. But no, they are more specific<br>
   on the terms and conditions because they go by the book. So, when an agent<br>
   tries to do everything, it's because he's trying. But when you request a<br>
   manager, and you're requesting something that agent can't do, you're going<br>
   to be denied.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, it's better to stick with the agent?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, sometimes. Or sometimes say, &quot;I want to cancel.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I want to cancel.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Ah, is that the best thing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, because you will go to retention, and they will get the<br>
   right skills. It's because every department, they have different skills.<br>
   The retention, what are they trying to do? The department of cancellations,<br>
   what are they going to do? They have all of the promotions that the<br>
   customer is happy for. They never tell you that the promotions, they will<br>
   probably hook you up with another contract. Even though you don't say<br>
   anything, but by you saying you want another discount, &quot;Okay, don't worry,<br>
   I'm going to provide you a 12-month discount.&quot; You're hooked with that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So every time I call AT&amp;amp;T, they're always telling me, &quot;Can I<br>
   tell you how we can give you a better ...&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. But with them, you have a script. They have a script, and<br>
   you will have to follow the script. So, the best point is, &quot;You know what?<br>
   I want to cancel.&quot; You will go with the department, and they will try to do<br>
   anything to keep you as a customer.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Okay. So, I'll never ask for a manager again.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No, don't do it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Just say I want to cancel. This is good. But do you ever put them on<br>
   mute and not listen?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. Sometimes you have to put it on mute, so the customer can<br>
   relax. There are some phones that you will have to let the client speak,<br>
   even if you put it on mute, they will be like, &quot;No, I don't want you to go<br>
   on mute.&quot; Or some people, &quot;Okay, take your time.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Tim: So, I'm just wondering, does anyone ... I assume most of these calls<br>
   are coming from the United States. Does anyone hear your accent and ever<br>
   attack you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Oh yeah, all of the time. That's in every call center here. I<br>
   mean, that happens all of the time, that when you talk to somebody, and<br>
   they say, &quot;Oh, I don't want to talk to you. I want someone from the United<br>
   States.&quot; The only thing that you control is, &quot;You know what? I'll transfer<br>
   you to the IVR—&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: To the what?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: The IVR. &quot;But I won't promise you-&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What's the IVR?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: When you call to customer service—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Tim: An automated system.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. So that's when you will be like, &quot;You know what? Okay. I<br>
   will transfer you to the IVR, but I won't promise you that you will be<br>
   speaking with somebody from the United States.&quot; They will get upset and<br>
   they will hang up. Other than that, you will tell them, &quot;If you want to<br>
   talk with someone from the United States, you will have to go to the local<br>
   office to do the process because pretty much all of the call centers are<br>
   ... I mean, I'm working, right now, Alliance, I don't do any phone calls. I<br>
   don't receive phone calls, it's pretty much back office. It's kind of<br>
   different. But it's better, I think. It's less pay, but it's better.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you think that being in the United States, living there, that<br>
   there are certain things that made you feel American in any way?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. Because there is one thing, and I'm going to put it<br>
   that way. Thanksgiving. Yeah. For me, Thanksgiving is like something that I<br>
   had to do on my own. First of all, at my house, they were like, &quot;What's<br>
   this? Why you do this?&quot; I go, &quot;It's because I thank God because I have food<br>
   on the table.&quot; That's something that we do every year. There’s some points,<br>
   football, like baseball, basketball, things like that, that over here, they<br>
   don't see it that way. But Thanksgiving, yes, it's something important.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, did you become an American football fan?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: The Vikings?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Well, pretty much, I'm not a fan for one team only. I like<br>
   Vikings, I like the 49ers, and Oakland too—they have no difference to the<br>
   Raiders in Oakland, because the only difference is that bridge. But yes,<br>
   pretty much, I like a lot of teams that we used to do over there, that we<br>
   don't do over here. But I see them doing it. From here, too, I've got some<br>
   teams that I knew.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, what about in your way of thinking? Do you think that there is<br>
   anything American that's different about Mexican?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. I mean, it could be a lot of things. It would be the<br>
   persons, the way I think.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Like what?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Like you know, the way I think right here, sometimes people are<br>
   really close. They don't see further than what Americans can see. Americans<br>
   can have liberty to do more things, and Mexicans, they're all tight. They<br>
   don't let you do things. That's the difference. For me, like with my son,<br>
   he's, right now, he's going to graduate from primaria [elementary school].<br>
   I let him go to sleep late. Some people, like my sisters, to their son,<br>
   they don't see it that way. So that's something different. I let my son,<br>
   with a cell phone. She's like, &quot;No, my son is not going to have a cell<br>
   phone until he's older.&quot; That's a difference that we have.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: But I mean, I like it because I'm a single dad. I like to have<br>
   communication with him, to be like, &quot;How are you? How is school?&quot; One of<br>
   the things, I quit AT&amp;amp;T, that was one. It was far away from my house. I<br>
   used to wake up at 4:40 in the morning. I used to be there before seven. I<br>
   will get out around six, from AT&amp;amp;T, and I would be at home around, from<br>
   eight to nine. That was from Monday to Friday. So, I didn't have time with<br>
   my son. Now on the job that I have, I work from seven to three. I work from<br>
   Monday to Friday. So, it's pretty good. But my son will go alone to the<br>
   school, where I will have to pay a taxi, but I will go to pick him up out<br>
   of school. That's something that helps me. I'm not making a lot of money<br>
   like I used to. But I'd rather be with my son.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Does your son consider himself Mexican at all?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. He could be one Mexican, and he's completely the Mexican<br>
   flag. He knows he's American, but he looks Mexican. If you will tell him,<br>
   &quot;Yes, I am from the United States, but I'm from Mexico, too.&quot; He will be<br>
   like, &quot;Mexico, Mexico.&quot; This is funny, because sometimes, when we had the<br>
   soccer games, Mexico versus United States, we will be at home, and be like,<br>
   &quot;A quien le vas?&quot; [who are you rooting for?] He will go, &quot;Mexico.&quot; That's<br>
   funny, because that's something that we would play with him because we<br>
   would tell him, &quot;But you're not Mexican. You have to go for the United<br>
   States.&quot; He's like, &quot;No. I go for Mexico.&quot; But that's something—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Who did you go for? Who did you root for?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I'm not really into it, to the soccer. Whatever wins. I'm not used<br>
   to it, to soccer games. I'm more used to—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But if somebody asked you to that soccer game? Para quien le va?<br>
   [who are you rooting for?]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Oh, I would be like Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. Even over there, I mean ...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But I'm wondering, because your son came here so little, whether he<br>
   might be more Mexican than you are in some ways.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Even though he's the American, and you're the Mexican?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I know. That's something that I will tell him. My son doesn't<br>
   speak English. Some people will say to me, &quot;Why you don't teach him?&quot; I<br>
   mean, I teach him some words. He knows, like I tell him, &quot;Do your bed.&quot; He<br>
   knows what I'm telling him. But he doesn’t know how to pronounce it. Why?<br>
   Because at school, they only speak Spanish. They don't have an English<br>
   class. He doesn't have nobody to talk English but me. I'm the only person.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: In his way of thinking, is he more Mexican in some ways than you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, even the way that he talks sometimes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: The way that he talks, you said? Like what?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: We call right here, we talk like Chilango, they have some<br>
   different words. I'm from here, but I don't even talk that way. He talks<br>
   that way. I'm like, &quot;Mijo, why you talk that way?&quot; I don't mind it, because<br>
   he's a good boy. I'm not going to complain about him. Sometimes it's hard<br>
   for me, because it's only me and him. Before, when he was a kid, I think he<br>
   needed more of his mom. But now, we're getting there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How old was he when he came here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: One year.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: One year old. Wow. So, he's an American citizen?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Who came here because you were deported, and although he's an<br>
   American citizen, he's growing up in Mexico — I mean, he's a Mexican<br>
   12-year-old.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. I mean, he pretty much, even on Independence Day—that's<br>
   another thing that we celebrate here too. Him and me, on fourth of July, we<br>
   celebrate. We do something. Everybody is like, &quot;Why you do this?&quot; There is<br>
   something that people don't know. It's like Thanksgiving, too. People don't<br>
   know why we celebrate that. But we celebrate it, because for me, because I<br>
   used to do that, and I want him to keep doing it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So why is July 4th important to you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, we used to get all together, like family, and fireworks, and<br>
   it was the long weekend, so we would go swimming, we would go to the river.<br>
   In Minnesota, it was the river. In California, it was to the ocean, to the<br>
   sea, to the bay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you do hotdogs and stuff on July 4th?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No. Well, always, always, on Thanksgiving it was the turkey. On<br>
   the side, they would make some Mexican food. Same thing on the Fourth of<br>
   July. We would make some Mexican food.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, let me ask you just one final question about the deportation.<br>
   Could you have done your papers earlier?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: There was nothing you could have done?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: There was a period, because on the beginning, I had my interview,<br>
   in Ciudad Juarez, but they asked me for a waiver. So, when they asked me<br>
   for the waiver, I will have to reschedule another appointment. When that<br>
   happens, she didn't really help me out anymore.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But when you were still in the United States, did you delay?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No. The processes, it takes too long. That's why they let me<br>
   go—Immigration, when they got me, they let me go, because I was in the<br>
   process for my papers. They told me to keep going to court.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you have any contact with your daughter?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Not at all.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How old is she?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: She's 15. Not at all, her mom doesn't let her talk to me at all.<br>
   Not even with my son. But I mean, life is good. What can I say? Before it<br>
   was really hard, but now I'm used to it. I have to keep living with it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You sound like an amazing dad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I'm trying to. It's hard. Believe me. Two years ago, my mom passed<br>
   away. So, she was the one that used to help me a lot. But now it got a<br>
   little bit harder, because now he's getting a little bit older, and he's<br>
   getting older, and the problems start.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah. You don't have a partner?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No. No, I'm single. [Laughs]. No, I mean, I used to have a<br>
   girlfriend. But nothing else.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Thank you for sharing your story.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No, thank you to you. I wanted to talk. I mean, this is something<br>
   that is like therapy, because it helps me. Yesterday, one of my friends<br>
   came, and she was like, &quot;You need this. You need to go.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And? How do you feel now?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I like it. I like it a lot. It's something new. It's something<br>
   that I'll let everything go at this moment.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You really sound like an incredible dad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Thank you. I appreciate it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: It's very, very moving.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I appreciate it. I've been here for a lot of time. It’s tough to<br>
   be a dad sometimes. Sometimes there is things that I want to do, but I<br>
   can't because I have to be at home.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You know, I've been hearing stories all day long, about kids who<br>
   went, and their Mexican dads abandoned them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No, that won't happen.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: I'm ending my day – You are helping me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No, I mean—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You are giving me—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: One of the reasons that I will never do that, is because my dad,<br>
   when he was in the states, he left me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Your dad did it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: He left me. From that, I was like, “No.” From that, I was like,<br>
   &quot;No, I can't do that.&quot; I mean, I wouldn't do it. My son is my son, and<br>
   he'll always be there.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;div&gt;<br>
   &lt;br/&gt;<br>
 &lt;/div&gt;<br>
 <br>
   Follow up on June 8, 2019<br>
 <br>
 &lt;div&gt;<br>
   &lt;br/&gt;<br>
 &lt;/div&gt;<br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah. Okay. Has the last year been difficult?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Oh. What's been difficult?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, first of all is because for some time I stayed without a<br>
   job. Why? Because I was trying to ... For me to find a job is really hard<br>
   because I had to be with him. At the same time, I had to take care of him<br>
   from school, so for me it was really hard. So, I found a job, but it was<br>
   two hours and a half from my house just to go. And to come back, it was two<br>
   hours and a half. It was almost four to five hours, so I wouldn't have time<br>
   for him. And not just to take him to the school, to help him to do<br>
   homework. It's really hard. But I stayed without a job for two months.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: So right now, I found a really good job. I mean, it's really good.<br>
   I work from Monday to Friday. It's 45 minutes away from my house, so it's<br>
   really good. And then I got Saturdays and Sundays off.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What job?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: This is East Concourse Servicing. It's just a call center, but<br>
   it's a collision agency. I mean, it's pretty good. I wouldn't say, I don't<br>
   make a lot of money, but I'm getting there. It's close to my house. I will<br>
   be able to take him to school, and then he will have to go from school to<br>
   the house by himself. But I know that he went to the school. I know he will<br>
   be there, and I got time for him because I only work nine hours.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You work nine hours per day?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. From Monday to Friday.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What are you being paid?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, right now, the gross pay is $8,000. I mean, 8,000 pesos. I'm<br>
   sorry.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: 8,000 pesos for ...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Per month. Plus with that you have 2,000 pesos in vales de<br>
   despensa, that’s what they call the food vouchers they give you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Plus 2,000?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Per month. Plus a bonus that we could get. We could get from 2,000 probably<br>
   three or 4,000 more. All depends. And I mean, it's pretty good because I<br>
   got time to spend with him on the weekends. He's getting older already. I<br>
   mean, he's not a boy anymore. He's growing up, so I have to take care of<br>
   more of him. I have to be more time with him.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Are you worried about him?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What are you worried about?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: About everything. I mean, to be really honest with you, I don't<br>
   know, but if you go to one school from here from Mexico-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   I'm worried because sometimes you never know what could happen. Sometimes<br>
   they could go to the ... On the way to the school, there's a lot of danger<br>
   sometimes, even to cross the avenues. Some people, there's a lot of bad<br>
   people around here, too, sometimes, no? So that's why I'm worried. That's<br>
   why I'm always trying to get a good job, to have the money so we could<br>
   survive. At the same time, so I could be able to be with him, too, when he<br>
   needs. Right now, it takes me time, but the job that I have, it gives me<br>
   the opportunity to do a lot of things with him. So that's what I want, and<br>
   I want to stay with that job for a while. I mean, it's really good. I don't<br>
   make as much money as before, but I will be able to be at home to cook for<br>
   him, to do things with him. So that's something that I really wanted to do<br>
   because it's only him and me. If we don't take care of each other, who's<br>
   going to take care of us?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And do you ever think about him going back to the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes. Last week ... I have another daughter.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yes. I remember.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I don't know if you ever remember that I told you. She's going to<br>
   be 17 already next year, so she didn't talk to me at all before. She<br>
   started talking to me last Sunday. She was like, &quot;You know what? I want to<br>
   go and visit you guys.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Great.&quot; Well, I was happy. It’s<br>
   something that I would never expect. First of all, I never expect that<br>
   phone call at all. Second of all, when she says, &quot;Well, I want to see you<br>
   guys,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;I want to see you, too, Mija, but we had to wait for<br>
   you to get the passport and everything.&quot; I know it's going to be a process<br>
   and you know everything will cost money, but I will make it. Probably next<br>
   year, she will be here, at least for a couple weeks, no?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: But, yes, I want him to get the passport and everything so he can<br>
   go, too. Later on, I want to see if I could get my visa, just to go and<br>
   visit them or just to take him to visit and so he will be able to know his<br>
   country. Because, believe it or not, he wants to go and see. Sometimes he,<br>
   like in the school, sometimes he gets racismo. I don't like it. I want him<br>
   to go over there, too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: He gets racism because?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Because he was born over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But how do they know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: In the school and by the teacher, by one teacher.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But how do they know? He doesn't speak a word of English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I know but everybody around there knows him. They know who he is,<br>
   and they know me, too, and they're like, &quot;Well, he was born over there, but<br>
   he doesn't speak English. But he's born over there. “Es el gringo.&quot; [he’s<br>
   the gringo] I mean, that's how they tell him.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And what does he answer back? What do you answer?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] Cuando te dicen el gringo en la escuela o el maestro<br>
   que te decia, que decias? [when they call you the gringo in school what do<br>
   you say?]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roddy: [inaudible]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Pero que le decias? Es la pregunta. [what do you say? that’s the<br>
   question]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roddy: [inaudible]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: He's always shy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: I know. Except when he's dancing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I know. [laughs]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But what is he saying? What does he tell you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: On the beginning, he got upset because we talk about it. I was<br>
   like, &quot;You know what? If you want me, I will go and talk with that teacher<br>
   to stop the bullying,&quot; because he's pretty much that. But he getting to<br>
   swear me he doesn't care. He's like from here. He just, you know, nothing<br>
   changes. It’s just like normal because he's been raised in here for almost<br>
   all his life.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So how did your daughter get in touch with yeah?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: By her grandma. I had her grandma in Facebook, and we talk<br>
   sometimes, and she got ahold of me by phone. I was like, &quot;Great.&quot; I mean,<br>
   it was for a long time that she wouldn't get in touch with me. She didn't<br>
   even try to talk to me, and now she did. I'm like, &quot;Well, this is one step,<br>
   no, towards –.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Your friends with her grandma, which is your ex-wife's mother, on<br>
   Facebook?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I get along with them, except with the mom. I get along with both<br>
   sisters, with both brothers, and with the grandma. I mean, we get along,<br>
   but with her, we don't get in touch at all. I mean, she doesn't want to<br>
   talk to me, and I mean, that's fine because she's already with somebody<br>
   else. I respect that. Plus, I don't want to know anything about it either.<br>
   But there's something, she don't want… It's because she doesn't want... She<br>
   will want it. She will be like, &quot;You know what? I pay for the passport. She<br>
   pays for this. We do this. We do that.&quot; So, he will be able to go over<br>
   there, and my daughter will be able to come over there. We could be<br>
   connected, but she doesn’t want to do that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: She doesn't want to? But is she going to allow her daughter to come<br>
   here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, that's the thing that we were planning. I mean, I was<br>
   telling my daughter, &quot;Right now, I wish I could have the money to be like,<br>
   'You know what? I'll send you for the passport. And I have the plane<br>
   ticket.'&quot; But it's a process. I mean, I don't want to put things on the<br>
   hurry. I want just to be little by little. Probably if not by when she will<br>
   be 18, it will be different. Right now, this is one step. I know in one<br>
   time she will be able to come and is sooner than before.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: When was the last time you saw her?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Oh, yeah. It has 11 years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: It's been 11 years?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: It's been 11 years, and I want to see her already. I mean, I want<br>
   to see her. I know she needs me, and I need her, too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Have you spoken on FaceTime?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you see each other?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. But, I mean, it's not the same. I wish it would be like I<br>
   could have her here right here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah. Does she look like you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: I will show you a picture right now. Let me see. Hold on. Let me<br>
   see. She's really big, though.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What's her name again?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: America Natalie.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: American-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: America.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: America.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Natalie. Natalie.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Oh, my daughter's name is Natalie. Did you know that? Did you say<br>
   that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, I think you remember that you told me. Yeah, she's Natalie.<br>
   I'm trying to find a picture.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: It's a great name. You called her America?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. That's her name. I got some pictures, but ...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So these guys are actually Roddy and ... Do you call her America or<br>
   Natalie?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Natalie.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And Natalie are actually real sister?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, they're real brother.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And they're complete siblings, by blood?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: By blood. Yeah. They by blood. Oh, this one.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Oh, wow. Is this her?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Wow. She's pretty.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: And she's really tall, they say.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: She looks like – Well, so are you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: You think so?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: She looks like you. She really does.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, and she's the big one. She's right now 16. She's going to be<br>
   17.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Wow. Well, that's great. So she Facebooked you once?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, I mean-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: All of a sudden you got a message on Facebook?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Saying, &quot;Hi, this is Natalie&quot;?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: &quot;Hi, Dad. This is Natalie.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Hi. How you doing? It<br>
   was great to get to know you.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: It must have been.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. It was good. I mean, I wasn't – On Sunday, we were just<br>
   watching TV, and then I just see my cellphone, and it says, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; And<br>
   I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; Then I was like, &quot;Hey, how you doing, and how you been?&quot;<br>
   And that's it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Pretending for it not to be a big deal, but of course.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah, and it was good. I mean, because I know her mom wasn't<br>
   around, so she will be able to talk to me to tell me more things. Because<br>
   on the last times when I talked to her, it was like, &quot;Hi, Dad.&quot; &quot;How you<br>
   doing?&quot; &quot;Oh, hi. How are you?” “Bye.&quot; That's it. She wouldn't be able to<br>
   tell me, &quot;Hey, this is what's happening over here. I miss you. I want to<br>
   go,&quot; or something like that. It's a good start.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But she said those things?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. Now, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And has she talked to [gestures to Roddy]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. [to Roddy] ¿Si, verdad que hablaste con Natalie también?<br>
   [you talked to Natalie too, right?]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roddy: ¿Que?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] ¿Hablaste con Natalie? [you talked to Natalie?] [to<br>
   Anita] I mean, but the difference between them is that we have one issue.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Language.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: He doesn't speak English, and she doesn't speak Spanish. So, I<br>
   mean, he may understand a little bit, but some words and something. It's<br>
   all the same thing. She may know some Spanish and words, but that's it. So,<br>
   it's kind of strange. I mean, she doesn't speak Spanish, and he doesn't<br>
   speak English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Which is crazy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: And it happens. I mean, but we're fine, I guess.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Well, that's fantastic news. I'm just going to ask you. The most<br>
   difficult challenges you faced this year was finding a job?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Losing my job and finding a job.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah. Over the years, things have gotten better, though?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, yeah. I mean, yes. The only thing is that when you don't<br>
   have a job, that's a little bit hard. But then when you start working, you<br>
   start getting on your feet. You start on the track again, but we're getting<br>
   there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you know about programs that support returning migrants?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Not really. No, because even right here if you check, they have<br>
   help for madres solteras, [single mothers] but it won't happen to me<br>
   because I'm a single dad. I won't qualify for that. I mean, sometimes it<br>
   will be great just because you will get benefits like programs where they<br>
   can go and do some sports or something like that. But I don't apply, and he<br>
   won't apply either because he's not from here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, let me just finish this. We ask which of your relatives live in<br>
   Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: My brother and my sister.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Okay. Siblings. Are you in touch with them?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: We live together.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Oh, so you live with your brother and sister?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: We live together in the same house. Like everybody has his own<br>
   part, but I mean, everybody – they have to go to work. They have their own<br>
   families, so sometimes, even though they help you out and we help each<br>
   other, but sometimes you have to do things because they got other things to<br>
   do, too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Would you consider going back to the US?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Because I grew up over there, and to be honest with you, I miss a<br>
   lot over there. I know I could do more things over there than over here,<br>
   but you know one of the things that I don't want to go illegally, not<br>
   anymore. I mean, I want to go legally, and I know it may take some time.<br>
   But I could do it because my son and my daughter, they're from over there.<br>
   They will be able to get my papers fixed. When that happens, I want to be<br>
   able to go legally, and I want to go to work, do some things. Like how it<br>
   was my American dream back when I was over there. Right here, I won't say<br>
   that. At the beginning, when I got here, I didn't know nobody. It was<br>
   really hard. I got in depression and a lot of things, but now, I mean, I'm<br>
   living day by day, and I have to like it. I'm okay now. But, yes, I will go<br>
   back one day. But I want to go legally, not illegal.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And one question is do you think that the US government has<br>
   responsibility for Roddy?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: In some parts, I think, but they won't do anything. I mean, to be<br>
   really honest with you, they never going to do anything because they have<br>
   so many people over there. It's not just Americans. It's not Mexicans. It's<br>
   everybody. It's all the Latin people, all the people from Europe or from<br>
   Africa. There's a lot of immigrants from over there, and they, some of<br>
   them, they already born over there. So, they're Americans, too. They don't<br>
   even receive help.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But what about Roddy being here. What kind of responsibilities –<br>
   What do you think the US government should do to help Roddy?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Well, what I would like is probably just to help him with medical.<br>
   That would be all. I mean, because over there, they give you that – How's<br>
   it called? That program that they give you meals and all that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: And they give you benefits. Well, for that, I mean, I work for it,<br>
   and we used to pay our own things with your own work. But, I mean, I<br>
   wouldn't ask for money. The only thing that I would ask is for medical<br>
   assistance for him.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What about for his school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: And schooling. Yeah. And that's one of the things, too, because on<br>
   the future, one of the things that I want him sooner or later for him to go<br>
   back is because I want him to go to school over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: He's got to learn English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: Yeah. So right now, my goal up to this point is I want him to go<br>
   to an English school, and that's my new goal. I won't be able to do it in<br>
   this month, but probably next month, he will start doing English. And not<br>
   because I don't want to. It's because we need money to do all the process,<br>
   too. I'm starting my track and probably not this paycheck, I can’t do it,<br>
   but next paycheck, next month, I will be able to do it. And that's<br>
   something that I really want to do because, to be really honest, I probably<br>
   just want to stay probably right here one or two years more, and he may go<br>
   back. That's something that I have. I want him to go to high school over<br>
   there, just out of high school to go to college, so he could start the<br>
   school over there already.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And would his mother – could he live with his mother?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodrigo: No. No. I grew up in California, and I got a lot of aunts for my<br>
   mom's side. So, they will be able to take care of him, and plus, that's my<br>
   other goal, too. For next years, I want to try to apply for my visa. I<br>
   mean, I don't have no bad records at all over there. I didn't do anything<br>
   wrong over there. I came over here to fix my papers. I have everything, but<br>
   it didn't happen. So, I never tried to come back illegally, so I want to go<br>
   and try to get my visa. If I get it, good. If not, I'm just going to wait<br>
   for him to get my papers fixed. So that's my dream. I wish it will be done,<br>
   but we will try.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Those are great dreams. That's great dreams. Let me stop now.<br>
