So, like you said, my name is <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cristian</span>. I just go by <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span></br>   though [Laughs], everybody knows me as <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>. So I was born in the city of</br>   Puebla, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, which is a state south of here. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Seven months to a year</span>, in</br>   between that time frame, my dad took me, my older brother, my mom, and he</br>   took us to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I think we stopped by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Houston</span> and Galveston <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, and then we</br>   hunkered down in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma City</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>. That's where I lived all my life.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma City</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay. So you have no memory of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> as a baby?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: At all, at all [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Your whole life growing up was in the States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: ____ <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What was your favorite thing about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Everything. There's not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> thing I don't like. The only thing I</br>   don't like about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>, is the outskirt towns where they're not too</br>   accepting of outsiders—racism. It's like everywhere, racism even exists</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I've learned that so far. But that's the only thing I don't</br>   like about it. But I mean I'm really patient with people, so even when</br>   people would act rude with me, I would always talk to them nicely. Tell</br>   them, “Sorry to bother you, I'll go ahead and go back where I came from.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of rude things would people say to you, or racist things?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: I've always had tattoos, so they would think twice about offending</br>   me. They would just give me these looks. Say I'd go pump gas, &quot;Oh, we don't</br>   got no gas right now.” I just seen a guy pumping gas. &quot;I said we don't have</br>   gas right now.” “All right, sorry to bother you man. I'm heading out.”</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So, I'll just leave, stuff like that, and you can tell it's because</br>   race. Which it's okay, I pray for people like that, because they're not</br>   okay inside. That's the only thing I've dealt with there, a little bit of</br>   racism. But at the end, as I got older—because see I've been working since</br>   I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14</span> so I've been in the construction field all my life—I've met a lot</br>   of people that are downright racist, but when they meet me, they're like</br>   &quot;You know what, for a bean eating&quot;— they start saying that—they're like,</br>   &quot;You're all right man.” I was like, “You know what, you're all right too.”</br>   So I have a lot of friends that were racist before they got to meet</br>   actually somebody from a different race, and they're like &quot;You're all</br>   right.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's cool.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: &quot;You're not as bad as I thought. You guys aren't as bad as I thought</br>   you were.” [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You helped change their mind a little bit?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, I still talk to a lot of my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">GE</span>'s, a lot of the contractors. And</br>   like I said, I don't blame them. They were raised around it. Most people</br>   are products of their environment, so that's how I see it. I don't judge</br>   them on how they act, because sometimes that's how they were raised. So</br>   it's like, I'm really patient with people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: How is the racism in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, how does that compare to racism in the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Sometimes it's worse. Like me, I'm dark-complected. People that are</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> and they're light-complected, they're racist against you. The one</br>   thing that I do hate about that part of society here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is the fact</br>   that they're very racist against the indigenous. And me, I love my roots. I</br>   mean I was raised around <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native Americans</span>, so I have that love for the</br>   indigenous people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you have indigenous roots?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native American</span>, but from here, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: From here, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, I do. Yeah and I love it. I never knew it until I met my</br>   family. They're from this little town called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">La Palma</span>, over in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span>. And</br>   there's deer there and everything, and there's a volcano. And I started</br>   meeting everybody, and they do the whole dance, the dance [inaudible</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:04:32</span>], all that stuff. They dress up and they go to the big towns to</br>   make money and dance. They danced because they want to, because it's their</br>   tradition. But obviously they ran into foreigners that &quot;Hey, can I take a</br>   picture with you?&quot; and then the foreigners will give them a tip.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: After I found out I still have family here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> that I didn't</br>   know, but they still actually lived like the indigenous, that was really</br>   exciting for me because I've always had this really, really deep passion</br>   for history. I just love learning history. That's my favorite topic, is</br>   history.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That probably was really cool, connecting with that part of your</br>   family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: It was, it was. Because see, they were more accepting than my other</br>   family. On my dad's side, my dad, his dad, has <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Arabic</span> in him, and his mom</br>   is from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Spain</span>. Well you can imagine, they're both light-skinned, so my</br>   dad's really light-skinned. My dad is the black sheep of his side of the</br>   family. So his side of the family, they do not like us at all. They say</br>   that we're not even part—we're not even ___. They say we're not. They don't</br>   even claim that name. But I just pray for them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So, you don't talk to them?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No they don't even let me go to their... I've only went to my</br>   grandma's house <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> times. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span> time was with my dad. The last time I</br>   went, I went by myself and I rung the doorbell and they were like &quot;Who is</br>   it?&quot; I was like &quot;I'm <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cristian</span>, I'm come here to see my grandma. My abuelita</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Marta</span>.&quot; I was like &quot;Who's this, is it my tia?&quot; And they're like &quot;Okay, just</br>   wait there, she's coming out.” And she has a walker. They made her go</br>   outside to talk to me. Yeah, that's how bad it is with them. They don't</br>   like us, I don't know why—it's because of the skin color thing, I don't</br>   know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You think it's because they have lighter skin, so they don't accept</br>   you?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Because their roots, really. Because they have money, they have</br>   factories where they make fabrics and stuff. So they're loaded. When I</br>   first got here, I was buying stuff left and right for my cousins and stuff,</br>   so I guess they seen it as me trying to challenge them or something. I</br>   don't know. But me, I was just sharing the happiness with my family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: They seen how I dress, they seen my tattoos, and they don't want no</br>   part to do with me. They don't want me talking to their children or</br>   anything like that. They don't want me to give them a bad influence, I</br>   guess—make them think &quot;Hey look, his tattoos look cool, I want to get a</br>   tattoo.” I think that's really what it's about.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: They see you as a bad influence?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Just based on how you look?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. And that's normal. Well, back in the States it's not like that.</br>   No, not at all. Because back in the States everybody has tattoos. I know</br>   nurses and lawyers that have tattoos. It's nothing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: The tattoos. You think people judge them more here, than in the</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Oh yeah. Especially mine, because they see mine and they're like &quot;Oh,</br>   he has numbers on him. He's from a gang.” No, that's the area code to</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>, look it up man. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Which one, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">405</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">1405</span>. I added the one because—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> for the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. There you go, you know. [Laughs]. Yeah, and then this is the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span> flag.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: If you've ever seen the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span> flag, that's the symbol on there.</br>   This is the skyline of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>. This says “<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Oklas</span>,” which is how us</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chicanos</span>—<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Ochos</span> as they call us here—that's how we say <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span> back there.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklas</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklas City</span>. I was raised in the west side of town, so I have the</br>   west bound. That's where I've always lived. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Oklahoma City Thunder</span>. The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">I40</span>.</br>   I'm still going to get all the highways that I've been on in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span> and</br>   all over the States. I don't know why, I love driving man. That's the one</br>   thing I've always loved is driving, is traveling. Road trips.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span> is beautiful drive. I've driven just across country, across</br>   through <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Through <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">I40</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I don't remember.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Was it east-west or north-south?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Going east-west.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Okay. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">I40</span>, that's this one.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Just wide-open roads—</br> </br> </br>   Cris: This one is north-south. Takes you from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span> all the way up to...</br>   What is that, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Wyoming</span>? No. What state is that? Above <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Kansas</span> there's...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nebraska</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nebraska</span>, there you go. I went all the way to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nebraska</span>. That's as far</br>   as I went.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Your arm is just full of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span> pride.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What about these ones?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: This is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Oklahoma City Dodgers</span>. These <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> roses represent my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span></br>   daughters, my oldest one and then my baby.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You'll have to tell me more about them in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a minute</span>.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. This just says pretty much, it's a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Korean</span> word, it's Elohim</br>   [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Korean</span> 00:08:55]. But Elohim is a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hebrew</span> word, it just means God. So, it</br>   pretty much breaks down to God the Father and God the Mother in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Korean</span>, but</br>   it's a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Hebrew</span> word.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Cool.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Half-Korean</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">half-Hebrew</span>. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's very multi-cultural. I like it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah, because—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Korean-Hebrew</span> tattoo.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I just love everything about life. There's no room in my heart for</br>   hate. So I love every culture. I'm so intrigued by every culture. I love</br>   learning languages. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Arabic</span>, I know a little <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Arabic</span>. A little <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Korean</span>. I want</br>   to get into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Russian</span>, but—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Oh, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Russian</span>'s tough.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, I mean the only thing I've learnt is [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Russian</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:09:31</span>], and</br>   that's just a greeting. That's good enough for me, at least I know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span></br>   word. [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span> laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's good for now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah, so I mean this is my older daughter's name. An ex-girlfriend</br>   that I had in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, she passed away.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: That's fine. It was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2013</span>, so I accepted it. This one, my brother</br>   wanted to practice. This is the only one that doesn't mean anything.</br>   [Laughs]. I let my brother practice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It's from your brother.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. I love my brother, he's awesome. This one is symbolical,</br>   because ever since she passed away, I got this one. Because it's</br>   symbolical. Ever since she passed away, it's storms, and this is supposed</br>   to be lightning. And she's crying. So it's like ever since she passed away,</br>   it's been stormy days and sad days in the city, that's why it's raining on</br>   the city. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: And this is actually symbolic for her as well. She was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native   American</span>, she was from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Northern Cheyenne Arapaho Tribe</span>. There's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span></br>   princesses to each, there's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Northern</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Eastern</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Southern</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Western</span></br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Cheyenne Arapaho</span> tribes. She was one of the princesses of her tribe. They</br>   picked the prettiest ones and the ones that danced the best, their</br>   indigenous dances, and she was part of that. Yeah, she was a really awesome</br>   person. So I told them to do a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native American</span> princess on me, but he ended</br>   up doing some Anime stuff. [Both laugh]. It was an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Asian</span> guy, and he</br>   skipped town after he did this. He knew he messed up, so he skipped town.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It still looks <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native</span>, it's like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native American</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span>, mixed.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, it's cool because I just love every culture. I don't hate it, I</br>   just wish it would look more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native American</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: But see in a way it's a good thing, because see down here, having</br>   this, since it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native American</span>... See the thing here is, there's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span></br>   categories of deportees, There's the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Cholos</span>, gangbangers, and there's the</br>   neutral ones that don't get into that stuff. I'm on this side. So, I look</br>   like I'm from this side, like a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Cholos</span>.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: People always go to &quot;Hey, where you from?” I'm like, &quot;I'm from</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span>, but I lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>.&quot; They're like, &quot;Nah, where you from</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Homie</span>?” I'm like, &quot;I was raised I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>.” They're like &quot;Quit acting</br>   stupid, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Homie</span>. Where you from?” I'm like, &quot;What, you mean like gangs?”</br>   They're like, &quot;Yeah, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Homie</span>, what you banging?” I'm like, &quot;I don't gang</br>   bang, man. I'm too mature for that stuff,” and then they get mad. They get</br>   made when you tell them</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Because I mean, I don't hate it, but I'm totally against gangbanging</br>   and all that bad stuff. Narcotrafficking, I hate that stuff. I just don't</br>   like it, because it's like you're fighting over a street corner that's not</br>   even yours—it belongs to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the United States Government</span>. A gang that has</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> letters and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> numbers, what do you get out of it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Why do you think that so many migrant young guys in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> end up</br>   getting involved in gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Absence of a father in all honesty. Because when I was a teenager, I</br>   started hanging out with gangs just to fit in. I got out of it like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year   </span>later, because I realized it wasn't for me. But yeah, everybody that's in</br>   there is either because their dads are in prison or their dad, or they left</br>   them. And they feel comfortable around their homies to where they feel like</br>   they're their brothers and they look up to them.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: In all honesty, people will probably tell you something else, but</br>   they're just trying to cover the fact that it's because of the absence of a</br>   father. Or lack of attention from their mother sometimes. Like me, my mom</br>   was always too busy working. So I would get suspended from school, I walk</br>   down the block and there goes the big homies. The big homies. [Chuckle].</br>   And they're like, &quot;Hey man, come over here. Hang out with us.” <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> thing</br>   leads to another, but that's how it starts: lack of attention at home.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Needing a role model—</br> </br> </br>   Cris: There you go.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: An older figure.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: That's what it's all about. I mean, people will say &quot;Man, that's a</br>   stereotype.” No it's not, I lived it. I know for a fact that's what it is</br>   because everybody that I knew that was my age hanging out with them</br>   gangsters, they were there for the same thing. Their dads were in prison,</br>   locked up or dead. So I think that's the main problem right there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So why was it that you were able to avoid that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Ever since I was little, my mom even told me, she said that I'm</br>   weird. Everybody thinks I'm weird, because I'm very mature for my age and I</br>   think things over a lot. I overthink a lot. I've even passed out in the</br>   subway. Because I have really bad claustrophobia. And when I go out in</br>   public, I stand out bad. So you can imagine how that... Well, I mean, I</br>   haven't explained it to you, but I get really bad anxiety—really, really</br>   bad. To the point where my fingers go numb and then my toes go numb, and</br>   then slowly but surely all the electricity comes. It feels like electric</br>   shocks, and they'll come up my arms and my legs, and I know that since I've</br>   been through it so many times, I know what's coming next. So I try to get</br>   out of the subway.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you get panic attacks?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. I sit there and I think I'm breathing right, and out of</br>   nowhere, just my vision just going like this, and I feel my lungs like this</br>   little, and I'm sitting there, [Pants] I can't breathe. Then out of nowhere</br>   I'm just like &quot;Oh, crap,,” and I can just see myself falling and I can't do</br>   anything about it. I get paralyzed and I just fall, and I go to sleep. That</br>   happens a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Here, it's worse. Back in the States I didn't really deal with it</br>   that bad, but when I got here…Since I stand out so much. And back in States</br>   it would be just overthinking, like &quot;Oh, people are probably staring at</br>   me.” No, here, it's because they're staring at me. It doesn't matter what I</br>   do. If I'm smiling, they're staring at me. If I'm in a bad mood, they're</br>   staring at me. They're always staring at me. So I just feel that pressure</br>   on me. It affects me a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It's making your anxiety a lot worse here?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: A lot worse. [Chuckle]. I passed out in the subway about six, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">seven</span></br>   times. I got a phone stolen from me one time when I passed out, and my</br>   wallet. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah, people here are always looking to get over on you. I've dealt</br>   with that a lot here—well, just with the cops. That time was the only time</br>   that I don't know who did it, nobody seen nothing. Obviously somebody seen</br>   it, but nobody seen nothing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What about with the cops?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Oh, man. My welcoming to my country, I was walking in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two   </span>weeks after I got here. I was really depressed, I was crying, I was even</br>   suicidal. Really, really bad. It was the worst of the worst you can</br>   imagine.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: How old were you at that time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">25</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">25</span>. And how old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">27</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay, so <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years ago</span> you came back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah. Oh it's going on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span>, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">September</span> it'll be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>. But</br>   it's crazy because ever since I was little I was bullied a lot, right? Now</br>   that I got older, a lot of people used to bully me back home, but they're</br>   littler than me. I grew. I was always in military school, so I was always</br>   into discipline. When I got married I let go, I got used to being a father,</br>   so I just let go.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: But when I would see people that would bully me in middle school and</br>   high school—I would see them on construction sites being the cleanup</br>   guys—they'd be like &quot;I know you bro, what's up?” And I'm like &quot;I don't</br>   remember you.” They're like &quot;Yeah man, we used to be friends at this</br>   school.” And then after I talked to them, I'm like, “Where do I know this</br>   guy from? This guy used to bully me. Why did he try to act like I used to</br>   know him?”</br> </br> </br>   Cris: That right then just shows I could sit there and get my revenge, but</br>   there's no room in my heart. Like I said, there's no room in my heart for</br>   hate, revenge, or nothing like that. But like I said... I'm sorry, I kind</br>   of got lost there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's okay—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: I get—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: This is why I talk to you. I want to—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: I get sidetracked a lot. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: —Talk. I want to hear your perspective, not me making you say stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Okay. So yeah, like I said, when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got here I was very, very</br>   depressed. I mean in my life I tried to commit suicide <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> times.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. Once when I was back home. I was a teenager, I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">16</span>, I</br>   can't remember. I can't do the math right now, I'm really bad at math.</br>   [Chuckles]. Well the mother of my child, when she was pregnant, she left</br>   me. She left me for somebody else because she thought the baby was from</br>   him. So I got really, really depressed and I don't know, I've just been...</br>   Everybody back home calls me cry baby. Cry baby, that's what they call me,</br>   because they know I'm really emotional.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: I know I look how I look, but I look like a big bad tough guy,</br>   whatever. That's what everybody tells me, &quot;You look like a gangster, you</br>   look like you don't even get sad,” or whatever, right? But no, a lo</br>   contrario, the exact opposite. I'm very emotional, very, very emotional.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So when that happened, it was around the time I was a teenager,</br>   around the same time whenever I was hanging around with the gangsters.</br>   Well, they used to hide their guns in my backyard, they used to bury them.</br>   And that's one of the reasons why my mom told me that she would want me to</br>   leave, and I would tell her &quot;You know what, you're right. I need to leave</br>   your house.”</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I went and buried up, got a gun out from the ground, and sure enough</br>   it was full of bullets. Well <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the whole day</span>, I was putting it to my head.</br>   Because I was really sad. It was dumb of me to do this, but I mean I</br>   learned from it. It's just weird, because the whole day I was cocking it</br>   back and trying to do it. And it wouldn't work. It just wouldn't work.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: And so the night time comes, and because night time is the worst time</br>   for me, because I feel like I'm all alone. Nobody's there for me. I feel</br>   like I'm nobody, I'm nothing. So I got the gun, and I put it here, and I</br>   lay down. I'm praying the whole time, I'm like &quot;God, let me go with you. I</br>   don't want to be here no more.&quot; And then I pulled the trigger.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I thought I died. I honestly thought I died, because when I woke up</br>   everything was ringing and everything was black. I thought I was blind,</br>   because I went like this, so I thought that maybe it made me go blind. I</br>   was like, &quot;I'm alive, but I'm blind.” I was like, &quot;No. What did I do, what</br>   did I do?&quot; So, I started crying, and I'm going like this, then out of</br>   nowhere... This eye is busted, it's swollen. I couldn't even open. This one</br>   was not that swollen. It was swollen, but not as much as this one, and when</br>   I opened it I just see red.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So I sit up, and when I sit up, I felt like somebody threw a bucket</br>   of hot water over me. Because all the blood that was around me, it followed</br>   me and was dripping on me. I was literally spraying like a fountain,</br>   because I went like this and I just seen the blood pumping out. I was like,</br>   “Okay, so I'm dying. Just calm down.” And I stayed there, and I was like</br>   &quot;Why am I not dying?” So I go to the restroom and I open my eye, and I just</br>   see that all this is just blasted open.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So my brother goes in, he takes me to hospital, long story short. The</br>   doctors told me &quot;You don't have a bullet in you, bullet came out.” And</br>   they're like, &quot;You have somebody watching over you, because if that bullet,</br>   if it wouldn't have bounced off you bone, it would've went into you head</br>   and you'd be dead. If not, you'd be paralyzed from this side.” Because it</br>   was going to go into this part of my brain.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So, it bounced off?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: It went in here, it messed up this, this was reconstructed. It came</br>   out here. It went in my nose and came out here. It went in here, when it</br>   hit here, you can imagine the impact. So all this was just open. I don't</br>   even know how it stayed so nice, they did a really good job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah, you wouldn't know looking at you.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, and you see this scar right here? That’s where the bullet came</br>   out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Little bit, it's a tiny scar though.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: It was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">25 caliber</span>. Yeah so it wasn't that strong of a gun, but it</br>   was enough power to go into my brain. They're like &quot;No, it's not your</br>   time.&quot; They're like, &quot;Because the bullet came out.” I'm like, “What?” I'm</br>   like, “Okay, so...” I was over the whole depression thing, right? After, I</br>   was like, “Okay so, I didn't die for a reason.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: So, then she got back with me, she was like, &quot;No, even if it's his, I</br>   want to be with you.” Because I told her, “Even if it's not mine, I want to</br>   be with you. I love you.” She was my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> girlfriend. I got with her, and</br>   I was with her, that was it. I decided from an early age that's who I want</br>   to spend the rest of my life with. So yeah, I mean we were together for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12   years</span>, up until I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's what broke you up?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, the deportation. She said you know what, I can't do this. After</br>   I signed the house over, the cars. After I give her all my money,</br>   because... At the end of the day I don't regret it. I regret what she did</br>   with it, but I don't regret giving it to her. Because at the end of the</br>   day, I did my part. I did the best that I could, sorry, I did the best that</br>   I could with it. I did the best that I could. I signed over everything to</br>   her, and I gave her all the money that I have hidden in my attic.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Because ever since a young age, all my general contractors, they</br>   would tell me since the early age &quot;Is it true you're married and you got a</br>   kid now?” like, &quot;Yeah,” they're like &quot;Boy you're dumb.” I'm like &quot;Why?”</br>   they're like &quot;Ae you one of them guys that go home and give her your</br>   paycheck?” I was like &quot;No.” I was like &quot;I give her what she needs to pay</br>   the bills and she pays them, because everything's in her name.” I was like</br>   &quot;I'm illegal.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Is she the mother of all of your children?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, yeah. I only have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> kids.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">Two</span> kids.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, and they're both with her.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: They both live with her?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah. I never got the DNA test on one, but I don't care. For me,</br>   she's mine. It's this one. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Emily</span>, I know for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">100%</span> she's mine. That's my</br>   baby. Like oh my god, I love her. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: When was the last time you saw your daughters?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Year and a half ago</span>. No, almost <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years ago</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Before you were deported? After?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah, after I got... No, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year ago</span>. Because I've been here a little</br>   over <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Last year</span> I was working over here at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">TeleTech</span> and out of</br>   nowhere she calls me—and she wasn't talking to me... <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Three months</span> after I</br>   got deported, after I signed everything to her and gave her all the money</br>   that I had hidden, she waited <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two weeks</span> and then I call her, and I can tell</br>   in her voice she's not okay. And she's not wanting to talk to me.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I went &quot;What's wrong? Whatever you have to tell me I'm ready for it.</br>   Just let me have it, just tell me. Don't let me think about it, because</br>   that hurts me more than knowing the truth. I just want the truth.” And she</br>   starts crying, she's like &quot;I'm sorry.” I was like &quot;It's okay. Don't worry</br>   about it. I know what you're going to tell me.” She's like &quot;I'm sorry, I</br>   tried to wait. I tried to wait.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I understand. Don't</br>   worry about it.”</br> </br> </br>   Cris: She was like &quot;I hope you can forgive me.” I was like, &quot;Well, I hope</br>   you can forgive me.&quot; I was like, &quot;You did nothing wrong. You're doing what</br>   you have to do, you're moving on. Because at the end of the day, you're on</br>   your own, you're a single mother. You can't do anything that'll make me</br>   mad.” I was like, &quot;I support you, I guess. I love you and it hurts me to</br>   lose you to another guy, but I mean, so be it.” And then she started crying</br>   and she hung up on me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: This was before I came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span>. So when she</br>   told me this, it took me back to when I was a teenager. I got really,</br>   really depressed. I slit my wrists open, and I fell and I hit my head, and</br>   I landed on top of my arm, so I didn't die. [</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Lucky break.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah. And then the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> time, it was right after that, actually. I</br>   was so mad that I didn't die. I even took out my stitches that I had, and I</br>   tried open it, but it hurted so bad that I was like &quot;Oh, It hurts so bad,</br>   I'm not doing this.” Because I actually found two veins, I don't know if</br>   they were the main ones, but I cut them up like this. And I sat there and</br>   run my hand under water, I was like &quot;I'm ready, I'm ready. I don't want to</br>   deal with this.” It hurted so bad.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I was so mad at the fact that I didn't die. I used to get prescribed</br>   medication for my anxiety, which I'm guessing it's the same as... Because</br>   back home I used to get prescribed Alprazolam, which is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Xanax</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay, yup.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Well down here, it's way stronger. And I was off my meds for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two   months</span> but I was keeping the boxes. I just didn't take them. And I told</br>   them <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the last month</span>, &quot;Hey, the pills are not working.&quot; They're like, &quot;We're</br>   going to give you liquid Alprazolam.&quot; So they gave me the bottle. I didn't</br>   take it. After, whenever it came to that time where she came out with the</br>   truth and everything, you can imagine. Everything that I worked for, that I</br>   worked really hard for all of my life back home, I lost it like that.</br>   [Snaps fingers]. Not only did deportation get me down, that was my breaking</br>   point. I grabbed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">35</span> pills and the whole bottle of liquid <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Xanax</span> and I drank</br>   all that stuff. I was paralyzed for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two and a half weeks</span>. Almost three</br>   weeks I couldn't walk, talk, think, or speak.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Did someone take you to the hospital?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: They found me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three days later</span> in my house and I couldn't move. I was</br>   just sitting there with my eyes open crying. I was dehydrated, I thought I</br>   was dying slowly. And I was like, &quot;Man, I picked the wrong way to die, but</br>   hey at least I'm dying.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Out of nowhere my uncle knocks on the door. And then he opens...</br>   because the windows are, at that time they weren't real windows, they were</br>   just a space with the glass and they were loose. He moved the window. He</br>   was like, &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cochi</span>, are you in there?&quot; He was, &quot;I'm just checking up on you.&quot;</br>   He's like, &quot;If you're asleep.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Then he calls me <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cochi</span>. It means pig. Because I was really big when I</br>   got here. And then he looks in there and he's like, I don't know I just</br>   hear him, “Pinche, Cochi,.” He kicks in the door a bunch of times and he</br>   gets a hammer and he breaks it. And then he's looking at me on the forehead</br>   and then he sees my eyes are open. And then he's, &quot;What's wrong? What's</br>   wrong?&quot; And I'm just sitting there crying.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And at this point you can hear him, but you can't move?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah. I can't do anything, I was paralyzed. I could not do anything</br>   to save my life. And he picks me up. And he's, &quot;Help me <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cochi</span>, Help me.&quot; He</br>   goes, &quot;I'm trying to help you.&quot; And I'm just sitting there like this. I'm</br>   just barely moving my head. I'm trying to talk and I couldn't even move my</br>   hands. I just started crying and crying. And sure enough he takes me to his</br>   house. I don't know why they didn't think about taking me to the hospital.</br>   I'm glad they didn't because now I realized they didn't take me because</br>   they would have put me in a psychiatric ward.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And you didn't want that to happen?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No. No. No. For me to be locked up is the worst for me. I cannot be</br>   locked up inside. Most of the day I'm not even inside of my house because</br>   of the fact that I feel like I'm in prison. I don't like it. I'm always</br>   outside. I'm always looking for something to do, hang out with friends. At</br>   least just to talk. I don't like being inside of the house. I like being</br>   out and about.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You feel like you're in prison if you’re at home?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah, because after being locked up, whenever I'm in my room, I don't</br>   even sleep with my door closed. This is going to sound weird but I'm scared</br>   to be alone. I'm scared of the dark.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And that's just since being locked up?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Well, I've been scared of the dark since I was a kid. But since being</br>   locked, I'm scared of being with shut doors, I'm scared to be by myself.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">The two days</span> out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the whole four months</span> that I've been staying at this</br>   new place that I've been there by myself for like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">an hour</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>. Man I go</br>   crazy and I just go walk around the neighborhood because I can't. I just</br>   get really sad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And when were you locked up?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">June 12, 2015</span>, is when I got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Oklahoma City County Jail</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So, let's back up just a tiny bit.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Okay, yeah sorry I'm just—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: No, that's okay. How did you end up there? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Okay, so I'm going to try to say this. I hate saying this but okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: I've always been a hard-working man. I woke up same routine as every</br>   day, but this day I forgot to pee before I left home, so I pull into the</br>   gas station—I'm on my way to work, it’s <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">4:30</span>, I'm at the gas station</br>   already. I pulled in a little too fast and I hit my brakes and I'm, &quot;Oh,</br>   crap.” But I park. There's all these <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. Everybody else is there too.</br>   Everybody else going to work getting their coffee. I hit the front door and</br>   I open it for some people. And then I hear him and he's like &quot;Driver, stay</br>   where you are.&quot; And I look over at him but he's busy with his radio so I'm</br>   maybe he's talking to somebody else. So I grab the door and I walk in and</br>   he's, &quot;I said stay right where you are.&quot; And he's holding his gun.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: And I'm like, &quot;Whoa officer, you don't have to do this.&quot; I was,</br>   &quot;What's going on here?&quot; He was like, &quot;I told you to stay where!” He's</br>   cussing, &quot;Stay where the fuck you're at.&quot; Okay officer. I was, &quot;I'm abiding</br>   by everything you're telling me, what's going on here? What's going on? I</br>   haven't done anything.&quot; He was like, &quot;That's for me to decide.&quot; He goes,</br>   &quot;I'm investigating a crime that happened around here and you fit the</br>   description.&quot; I was like, &quot;Officer, with all due respect, that's a pretty</br>   dumb statement because I'm just same as all the other <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> in here.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;Look at us, we're all in fluorescent shirts, blue jeans, and</br>   work boots.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why you don't grab anybody else? How come it's</br>   just me?&quot; He goes, &quot;Like I said, you let me deal with this. You let me</br>   worry about the rest of the guys. Right now I'm focused on you.&quot; He goes</br>   &quot;What's your name?&quot; I tell him my name. Looks me up, He's &quot;I can't find</br>   you.&quot; I was like “Yeah because I don't have a criminal record. I've had</br>   traffic violations but that's it.” He's like, &quot;Naw, you're lying to me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So you know it turns out I did give him my right name but they needed</br>   my fingerprint. When my fingerprint came up, I had a warrant that he</br>   couldn't see with just my name. He had to have my fingerprint. I had sent</br>   my buddy to pay off a traffic ticket that I had got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three weeks</span> before that</br>   for the same thing. Well he didn't pay it off. He pocketed some of the</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Your friend did?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. So that's why I had the warrant. But that's not why he deported</br>   me. Or why he arrested me. He arrested me because the fingerprint guy, the</br>   guy that came with the fingerprint scanner, he was really racist. And he</br>   grabbed me, he twisted me up and everything. He was like, &quot;You want to</br>   fucking play smart with me?&quot; He's cussing up and down. And I'm like,</br>   &quot;Officer, I don't know why you're doing this but go ahead. You could have</br>   just asked me I would have put my hand out there.&quot; I was like, &quot; You don't</br>   have to do all this. What's wrong with you?&quot; And then he's putting his hand</br>   on the back of my neck. He's like, &quot;I told you to shut the fuck up.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Cris: And I was, “Okay officer.” So, then it turns out I had a bench</br>   warrant for failure to appear in court for a traffic violation. I'm like,</br>   “No that's not right.” I always pay off my traffic tickets. And he looks at</br>   the picture because they don't have a picture of me since I was a teenager.</br>   That's the only time I've been to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Juvy</span>. I had my own car by then so they</br>   though I stole it because it wasn't in my name—it was in my dad's friend's</br>   name. But after he proved it wasn't stolen and everything it was good. But</br>   they did take me to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Juvy</span>. The CIC, it's not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Juvy</span>. So they take your picture</br>   and everything. So, they are like, &quot;That's not him.&quot; I was like, “Please</br>   think that's not me. I hope they really think that's not me because it was</br>   me.”</br> </br> </br>   Cris: And they're like, &quot;He don't have the tattoos.&quot; Because I didn't have</br>   tattoos when I was a teenager. And then out of nowhere he's like, &quot;Just</br>   take him in. We'll just figure it out in there.&quot; And that's how they took</br>   me in. That guy he told him. And the other guy was like, &quot;Man, I really</br>   wish I could help you right now. Because I'm not going to write you tickets</br>   for no insurance. I'm just going to write you a ticket for no driver’s</br>   license. That's it. I'm not going to get you for suspended or nothing like</br>   that. Just no driver's license. I really wish I could help you.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;At the end of the day, man you're doing nothing wrong. I can tell</br>   just by looking at you you're not a bad person. You're investigating a</br>   crime, I get it. But you're a part of this so I'm just going to pray for</br>   you. It's not your fault. God knows it's not your fault.&quot; And he's just</br>   sitting there and he's like, &quot;Man.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Because I told him, I was, &quot;Literally what y’all doing right now,</br>   y’all separating a family. Even though I'm not legally from here, because</br>   I'm going to be completely honest with you officer. I'm an illegal</br>   immigrant. I'm here illegally.&quot; And then he said, &quot;Well, how you working?&quot;</br>   I was like, &quot;Well, I'm an illegal immigrant, you can answer that by</br>   yourself right?&quot; And he's like, &quot;Yeah, I get it.&quot; &quot;So you know what you're</br>   doing right now, you're separating.&quot; And I'm crying this whole time.</br>   &quot;You're separating a family. My daughters are going to be without a dad. My</br>   wife is going to be at home waiting on her husband to call her. She's going</br>   to be worried sick. My kids are going to wonder where's daddy?&quot; And he's</br>   like, &quot;Man, I'm really sorry.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's okay officer, it's not</br>   your fault.&quot; And then the other guy he's like, &quot;Yeah, it's not his fault,</br>   it's your fucking fault for driving out here without a license.&quot; And I look</br>   over and I'm like, &quot;I hope God helps you with that attitude.&quot; And he just</br>   gets really mad and he ends up taking me to jail.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I just can't get over such a case of you were in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. That they just happened to be there investigating some</br>   other crime.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, I mean up until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the other week</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two weeks ago</span>, I was really</br>   confused about the whole situation because even though I'm not very</br>   religious, all my life I've always believed in God. Because at the end of</br>   the day my mom she always raised me religious but I got out of that.</br>   Because in my eyes it just me and God really. I always believed that God’s</br>   going to put me wherever I need to be. No matter what the circumstances. It</br>   might seem like it's the end of the world for me but in all reality, God’s</br>   helping me. God’s putting me somewhere where I need to be. And I have to</br>   think about it with a selfless mind. Because at the end of the day, me</br>   personally, I'm happier when I'm helping people. If somebody helps me I</br>   can't accept it. I can't I don't know why, I just can't. Because I feel</br>   like I'm a burden to people. What gives me calamity in my heart and my soul</br>   is helping others.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So I didn't understand until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two weeks ago</span>, my mom calls me and she's</br>   crying. I'm like, &quot;Calm down mom, what's wrong?&quot; And she's like, &quot;Where do</br>   you live?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>.&quot; Because she's like, &quot;Do</br>   you still live in an apartment, a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> room apartment?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, I</br>   live with my friends.&quot; She's like, &quot;Well, be expecting your brother.&quot; I was</br>   like, “Nah, don't tell me this.” And I felt so bad because he's losing his</br>   child too. He has a little baby girl that just like me. I have my little</br>   baby girls over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So your brother-</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: He was deported?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: He's getting deported. He's in immigration hold right now. Waiting on</br>   the bus to get filled up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So, he's in detention right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah. Yeah. So now I understand why everything happened the way it</br>   happened. Because my brother, when I got deported, he still didn't have a</br>   child. Yeah, because his daughter's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">less than two years old</span>. See the thing</br>   about me, since a young age I would go out of town and work. So, I'm used</br>   to, I'm not used to being without my kids, because I still miss them when</br>   I'm out of town working, but at least I know I'm going to go home and I'm</br>   going to be there with them. I guess it wasn't as hard as it would have</br>   been if I didn't have that background. When I got here, yes, I was</br>   depressed, suicide all that stuff but it wasn't as bad as it could have</br>   been. And I know that my brother, he doesn't go to work out of town. He's</br>   had so many job offers making <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">30 plus an hour</span> out of town but he doesn't</br>   take them. Why? Because he's so attached to his daughter.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What do you think it's going to be like for him?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Well, I think it's going to be better for him since I'm here. That's</br>   why I feel like I'm calm about the whole situation. Because God put me here</br>   because he knew my brother was going to get deported. I don't know, maybe</br>   I'm overthinking, but I don't know, I see it that way. But ever since I've</br>   been here, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the first year</span>, yes, it was depressing, all that stuff. But this</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span>, after I got here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, my life has been so amazing. I</br>   freaking love life.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I've been traveling. I've been going to the pyramids, museums,</br>   events, different events. I've met so many good people here. I have so many</br>   friends here. I have more friends here than I have back home.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's awesome. This makes me happy hearing this now. [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span> laughs].</br>   What's the best part about your life right now?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: The best part about my life, my new family, my friends that I live</br>   with. They're so caring about me because literally I waited <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> down</br>   the road to try the whole dating thing again, right? Because I've always</br>   had friends that are girls, but I always tell them, “No, I don't, you're my</br>   friend and that's it. I don't think about relationships all that stuff.</br>   Right now, I'm just focused on myself. I'm trying to adapt so I don't want</br>   to get sidetracked.” I was like that up until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">some few months ago</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Four   months ago</span>, I met this girl and we were dating and stuff, she was my</br>   girlfriend. And out of nowhere <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">last week</span>, I mean I'm cool about it now, but</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this past week</span> that just passed it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">my first week</span> without her. And I'd</br>   see her <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>. Because If I have a girlfriend it’s because it's</br>   something serious, it's not just I'm going to be with her for a little bit</br>   and that's it. No, because like I said I'm very emotional. I don't know,</br>   I'm a very loving person. I don't know. People tell me that I'm too nice.</br>   That I need to put up some barriers because I'm too nice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you think that you're too nice?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No. Sometimes I feel like I'm not nice enough. [Laughs]. Yeah, it's</br>   because I'm just all about positivity nowadays. I don't have no room for</br>   negativity in my life. Yeah, so <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this whole week</span> they just see me—I'd get</br>   home from work and I'm just not talking. I'm in my room listening to music,</br>   depressed. So they're like, &quot;Man, stop stressing over it. You make this</br>   house what it is. Your energy. Because everybody else is more serious.” I'm</br>   not going to lie, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> of them used to be gangsters and they still have that</br>   mentality. But when they hear me talk, little by little they're opening up</br>   to me. And they're leaving that life behind them because of how I explain</br>   things to them. I don't know, I just like to change people's mind about</br>   putting up that macho man persona. You don't have to do that. You don't.</br>   Yes, I get it you were in prison, you were in gangs, you had to prove</br>   yourself. You're getting a new chance at life here. Don't make the same</br>   mistakes you made back home. It's a fresh start.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you feel like it's been like that for you coming here? It's been</br>   a new start?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Oh yeah. No, since I got here, obviously <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the first year</span> was bad, but</br>   once I got here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span> I feel like I'm actually free because now I</br>   have things in my name. I have a job with my real name. [Laughs]. I don't</br>   have to use a fake social and stuff. I'm legal here, I don't have to hide</br>   anymore. For me this is a fresh start at life. This is how I should have</br>   felt back home. But back home I was always scared, “I'm going to get locked</br>   up, I'm going to get pulled over. They're going to take me, I'm going to</br>   lose my kids.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Have you ever felt this free before?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Never in my life. Never, never, never. That's why I don't even want</br>   to go back home. I have had so many chances to go back illegal with really</br>   good coyotes. And when I hear it I start crying. My mom's like, &quot;Why are</br>   you crying?&quot; She's like, &quot;You're coming home.&quot; I was like, &quot;That's the</br>   thing mom, I'm crying because I don't want to go home. I'm sorry.&quot;\ It</br>   might make me seem like a deadbeat dad, I don't know what it's going to</br>   make me seem like. I don't know how people are going to see this but I</br>   don't want to go home. I miss you mom, I love you.” Because I've been a</br>   mommas boy all my life. I love my mom to death. And hearing her cry, and</br>   she's like, &quot;but I want you here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: She wants you to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: &quot;The same way that you miss your kids, I miss you a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">hundred</span> times</br>   more.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: I'm very emotional since I was a little kid. And that's why they call</br>   me crybaby. Because I was always very emotional, my mom was always there</br>   for me. Well my dad would whoop me til where he would open my skin.</br>   Whooping me with the wire. She would literally step in and get beat up</br>   because of me. Yeah, my dad was very abusive. So whenever I hear her, she's</br>   like, &quot;You're my baby. I want you home <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Does that make some small part of you want to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. Yeah. I don't like…sorry. [Tearing up].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Oh man.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: No need to apologize.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: It’s just that—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I'm sorry we're digging up these emotions.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Oh, it's okay. I just haven't talked about this in a long time. I try</br>   not to think about it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Because you're such a positive person.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah. That's exactly what it is. God, I'm so sorry. Oh man, I'm so</br>   sorry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you think you can find some tissues?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Oh no, it's okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Are you sure, I can run down and grab some?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: I don't want you to do all that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I'll be right back.</br> </br> </br>   [Audio switches to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span> Part Two]</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So sorry, where was I?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Talking about how much you miss your mom.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, yeah. So that's the only thing that hurts me is when my mom</br>   talks to me like that because she tells me, she's like, &quot;You know how you</br>   love your daughters? I love you <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">a hundred</span> times more.&quot; So, it's like,</br>   &quot;You're still my baby. At the end of the day, you're the one that was</br>   always helping me out. Yes, I love all of you all equally, but you know I</br>   have a special place in my heart for you because I know how fragile you</br>   are.&quot; She tells me but in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> obviously. And when she tells me that I</br>   hate when... That's why I try not to talk too much to my family because</br>   when they tell me stuff like that it gets me sad, you know? And I don't</br>   want to be sad. I've came a long way to go back to that. So, even though</br>   yes, when I talk to her, when I think about it, I might cry. But when I cry</br>   it helps me because it gets that part of... I deal with it, and I move on.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It's a relief.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Even though it comes back, but at least I'm not saving it all up</br>   until one day and then this might happen again, something like this. So,</br>   yes, I still get sad and everything, but I don't get depressed depressed.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Have you had any suicidal thoughts since <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">that first year</span> back here?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No, no. Ever since I came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span> and ever since that last</br>   attempt, I realized it really isn't my time. I know it sounds like it's</br>   what everybody says, but I honestly believe it now. It's not my time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I believe it, too. [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span> laughs]. I don't think it sounds cliché or</br>   anything. I think it seems meant to be. It was not your time.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: It really wasn't, you know, and yeah, that's why—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You have a lot of great things ahead of you in your future.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yes. And that's why my outlook on life is so positive because I</br>   should have been dead right now. You know? Like that was my plan, but God</br>   had other plans, so I appreciate life now a lot more than I did back then.</br>   So yeah, I mean... I'm sorry. I forgot what we were talking about. I keep</br>   going back and think about my kids. I haven't thought about them in a</br>   while.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I mean, I'm going back to the same thing. It's like that's the one</br>   thing I struggle with is I beat myself up a lot over the fact that I can't</br>   cry over them all day like I used to know, because I accepted it already.</br>   So, I have this calamity on my heart to where it's ‘Okay, you're not doing</br>   anything wrong. You did what you had to do. You did your part. It's not</br>   your fault you can't go back. In a way it is, but at the end of the day,</br>   no, not really. Because if you could, you could just go back illegally. But</br>   what would that cause if I get pulled over? They put me in prison for</br>   re-entry, and they told me I would get <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three to five years</span> if they catch me</br>   in the country again, so I'm not risking that. No.”</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I mean, I know at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, I didn't care. I was like, “I'll deal with</br>   the time. I want to go back.” But I give her all my money, so I was waiting</br>   for my family to save up. By the time they saved up the money, I was</br>   already here, and I was like, &quot;You know what? Let me give it a try.&quot; I</br>   liked it. I loved it, and I'm here. I'm here to stay. I don't want to go</br>   home. And my mom cries every time she tells me, she's like, &quot;Come on, just</br>   come back.&quot; And I always tell my mom, &quot;Please don't talk about that.&quot; And</br>   she'd said, &quot;Why?&quot; And then she'd start crying. She said, &quot;But why? Why?&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;Because I just don't want to talk about it.&quot; She said, &quot;But</br>   what? When do you want to come home?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Cris: And she was like, &quot;So I can pay them. So, I can tell them.&quot; I'm like,</br>   &quot;Mom, that's the thing. I don't want to go home. I'm sorry, I just don't</br>   want to go home.&quot; And then that's whenever she starts talking to me like</br>   that, and I'm like, &quot;I'm sorry. You know I'm sorry.&quot; She's like, &quot;At least</br>   if you're not going to do it for me, do it for your children.&quot; I'll say, &quot;I</br>   am doing it for my kids.&quot; I was like, &quot;What good am I to them in prison? At</br>   least over here, one day when they're old enough, they can get a phone.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Because my older daughter, she calls me. It's been like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> since</br>   she hasn't called me, but she would call me hiding from her mom. She's</br>   like, &quot;Hey, Daddy.&quot; I'm like, &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniella</span>?&quot; She's like, &quot;Yes, it's me. Just</br>   don't talk too loud. My mom's asleep, and she's in the living room with her</br>   boyfriend. If she hears me talk, she's going to take the phone away.&quot; She</br>   says, &quot;I miss you, Daddy.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;I miss you, too.&quot; She's like,</br>   &quot;When are you going to come back close so we can be a family again?&quot; And it</br>   breaks my heart when she says that. I hate it when she sees that because</br>   it's like, God, she doesn't understand. I wish she could</br>   understand.[crying]</br> </br> </br>   Cris: She's so innocent, and she's says, &quot;I miss you, Daddy. I love you.&quot;</br>   &quot;I love you, too, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniela</span>. I think about you <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>. I miss you.&quot; And</br>   then she'd say, &quot;When are you going to come home?&quot; I told her, I said,</br>   &quot;Well, it's going to be a while, baby, but I'll be home <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one day</span>.&quot; She was</br>   like, &quot;Are you going to come? Are you going to come <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next week</span>? In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two   weeks</span>?&quot; It just breaks my heart—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Ah, that's how kids think.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: And I'm like, &quot;No baby. Baby, it's going to be a little bit longer. I</br>   have to be here for a little bit.&quot; She said, &quot;But you're not in jail?&quot; I</br>   said, &quot;No, I'm not in jail no more, baby. I'm in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot; She said, &quot;I can</br>   go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I have papers.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah baby, but you know your</br>   mom.&quot; She said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; She's like, &quot;Well, you can tell your mom, my</br>   grandma to pick me up.&quot; But her mom doesn't let her. She doesn't like my</br>   family. So, she always says, &quot;Well, do you promise when you get back, we're</br>   going to be a family again? You and Mommy?&quot; And I don't have the heart to</br>   tell her no.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah, what do you say to her?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: I tell her, &quot;Yeah.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, baby. Me and your mommy will</br>   be together.&quot; She said, &quot;You're going to get married this time?&quot; &quot;Yeah,</br>   we'll get married.&quot; She's like, &quot;Yay!&quot; And that was the last I talked to</br>   her. After she said, &quot;Yay,&quot; I don't know but I hear <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Brenda</span>. She's like,</br>   &quot;What the F are you doing? Give me that effing phone.&quot; And she said, &quot;No,</br>   no, Daddy, Daddy,&quot; and then clicks.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So, she's gone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year ago</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: That was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year ago</span>. Yeah, sorry. [Emotional].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's okay. [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span> chuckles]. Don't apologize.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Oh, God. It's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">forever</span> since I talk about this, so I mean, I'm</br>   better at it. Before, I couldn't talk about it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you want to move to a happier subject, or do you want to</br>   continuing talking about it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: No, that's fine. I mean, it's fine.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It's up to you.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: It's fine. I mean, because at the end of the day, if somebody doesn't</br>   come out and speak out about the real situations, everybody's always going</br>   to think, “Ah, it's whatever you know. Deportation is just... They can come</br>   back illegally.”</br> </br> </br>   Cris: They don't realize that, yes, we have that option. But what risks</br>   come behind that? <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Three to five years</span> in a federal prison? No, thank you.</br>   No, no, thank you. And people think, &quot;Oh, everybody that gets deported is</br>   either a murderer or something. Somebody that's out there gun slinging, and</br>   doing all this crazy stuff.&quot; And I'm living proof that not all of us are</br>   like that. There's actually real hardworking... I was a real hardworking,</br>   blue collar <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, and I consider myself <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. It's just that piece</br>   of paper that says I'm not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. That's the only thing that separates</br>   me from everybody else back home.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I was going to ask you about that because the vast majority of your</br>   life was in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> Do you consider yourself <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No, I don't. Yes, I know that my roots are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> and they're</br>   indigenous. But in my heart, my culture is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span>. I love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span>. I feel</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. Everything that I did back home I was... I was out there, you</br>   know? I hardly hung around <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. That's why my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> is so bad. I</br>   mostly hung around with black folk, white folk, and native <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> folk.</br>   So, I was always in the country fishing, hunting, going mudding, noodling</br>   in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span> rivers.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Wait, noodling?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: That's when you catch catfish, monster catfish, with your hands.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay, can you walk me through this a little bit more? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Okay, so what you do, you go into the red rivers and the muddy</br>   rivers. It has to be a muddy river. It can't be a rocky one because catfish</br>   don't do that. They don't got to pick up rocks. So, you go into the muddy</br>   rivers barefoot, and you feel around you, you dive down, like I'm standing</br>   up though and you feel around for holes. Once you find a hole, you know</br>   there's a catfish in there, so you go up and you let your boys know, &quot;Hey</br>   man, I got one,&quot; so they can pull you out just in case the suckers too big.</br>   So, take a deep breath— I'm really good at swimming, by the way. I can hold</br>   my breath for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">three and a half minutes</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">almost four minutes</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, a long time because I've been swimming since I was a little</br>   kid. When I was a little kid, I could hold it for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a minute and a half</span>. And</br>   I would sit there going purple, but doing it, everybody challenging me to</br>   stay longer. I can hold my breath.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I think I can only do <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">30 seconds</span>. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And I swim a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I just take a big deep breath, and the longest they timed me was</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">three and a half minutes</span>. But <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> time when I was in the ocean, this time</br>   we weren't swimming. We were just up there like this staying underwater,</br>   and they counted. They weren't timing it. But I mean, from my past</br>   experiences I was like, “Man, that had to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">longer than three and a half   </span>minutes. Come on, I almost died.” [Both laugh].</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So yeah, you take a big deep breath, you dive down in there, stick</br>   your hand in there, and you wiggle your fingers. Catfish thinks it's food,</br>   so you'll feel their whiskers touching your hands, and then you feel the</br>   nibble on the tips. Once you feel that nibble, the next bite is coming.</br>   That's the big bite. So as soon as you feel that nibble and you feel that</br>   suction, stick your hand in there, and stick it in his gills and push</br>   around in the mud. Make sure you don't just push like this straight because</br>   your feet will get stuck in the mud, and you're drowning. So, you got to</br>   sit there and work your way out. Once you get that sucker out the hole, you</br>   just swim up. And yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Probably so proud of yourself.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. It's an adrenaline rush. It's literally an adrenaline rush. I</br>   love it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I can imagine.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah, oh man, it's amazing. But in all honesty, I prefer fishing with</br>   a rod because it's more peaceful. You're out there just hanging out with</br>   other folk that enjoy that as much as you do. So, yeah. That's my thing.</br>   I'm more of a country guy than anything. That's why every chance I get I go</br>   hiking. I'll find something outdoorsy to do. Like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this weekend</span> since you</br>   know that girl broke up with me and stuff, they seen I was like in my</br>   feelings and stuff. Right? I wasn't really depressed depressed, I was just</br>   in shock that somebody that I thought was really being honest with me was</br>   not so felt betrayed. So, they're like, &quot;We got a surprise for you <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this   weekend</span>.&quot; They wake me up <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Saturday</span> and they're like, &quot; Wake up, loser.</br>   We're going to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Cuernavaca</span>. We're going to cow horn.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Wait, to what?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Cow horn. That's what Cuernavaca means. Cuerna is horn, vaca is cow.</br>   I call it cow horn because Cuernavaca is just like, “Eh, I'm going to</br>   switch it up.” Because everybody here... I like making people laugh. I like</br>   making people smile, and I do it unintentionally sometimes. Where I live is</br>   called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Indios Verdes</span>. Everywhere that I go, I don't call it by its <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   name, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Spanish</span> name, I translate it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. I don't know why. It's just</br>   something I do. I don't know why.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Because you're more comfortable in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> probably.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah, I guess so. So, where I live is called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Indios Verdes</span>, I call it</br>   Green Indians. A revolution constitution of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">1917</span>, stuff like that. Yeah, on</br>   our way there and I'm making videos, and I'm like, &quot;We're on our way to Cow</br>   Horn.&quot; And then everybody's like, &quot;What the hell is cow horn?&quot; And I was</br>   like, &quot;<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Cuernavaca</span>,&quot; and they're like, &quot;Oh shit, I see what you did.&quot; And</br>   I'm like, &quot;Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: And then like at the end of the road trip, we're on our way back, and</br>   I ran out of money before everybody else. So, I was telling everybody,</br>   &quot;Hey, man, I got you guys when we get back home. I'll get some money out</br>   and stuff and I'll pay you guys.&quot; They're like, &quot;Bro, do you think we're</br>   chipping about that? Bro, this road trip wouldn't have been the same</br>   without you.&quot; Because one of my roommates, he has a girlfriend that's kind</br>   of possessive. [Laughs]. So, she was in a bad mood the whole time, but I</br>   was making her laugh. When I'm making her laugh, she'd get happy with my</br>   roommate, and then everything was okay.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: And we climbed a mountain. I climbed down it barefooted so that I</br>   could feel the actual experience because every time I'm in nature, I go</br>   barefoot. Climbing upward, I didn't go barefoot because I didn't know what</br>   to expect, and I didn't know if there was glass or anything, so I walked up</br>   with shoes. Once I seen that the coast was clear, I climbed down</br>   barefooted. But at the top of that mountain there was an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Aztec</span> temple, and</br>   that was really awesome. I have a lot of pictures from that. The view is</br>   just so beautiful because you literally just climbed a mountain to see an</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Aztec</span> temple and then you could see everything. It's beautiful. And then</br>   everybody's like, &quot;This road trip wouldn't have been the same without you.</br>   Don't even worry about it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's awesome. I'm glad you get to do stuff like that. And you</br>   answered my question because I was going to ask, since you love outdoorsy</br>   stuff, what outdoorsy stuff do you get to do here?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. I mean—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What about fishing?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No, the waters here not good for that. I wouldn't fish here because I</br>   don't even drink the water from here, so I would definitely not eat the</br>   fish from here. I don't even eat seafood here because of the fact that I</br>   feel like it comes out of this dirty water that they have here, even though</br>   it's from their oceans. But their oceans are pretty dirty, too. I mean, I</br>   think it's... At the end of the day, it's probably same as back home</br>   because they're getting the fish from the oceans that are polluted.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It's the same ocean.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. The way I see it is they're getting their fish from the coast</br>   of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, and I know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is really dirty, so I'm okay on that. So, I</br>   haven't ate seafood. That's my favorite food is seafood. Oh, I'm lying,</br>   I've eaten sushi here. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: But that's not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> seafood.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah, they probably get it somewhere else. So that's the only thing</br>   that sucks about here is I don't get to go fishing and swimming as much as</br>   I would like to. Man, that's the thing I love about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>. We have so</br>   many lakes and woods. You're hunting, you catch some game, and you're</br>   cooking. Because when we go out there, the only people I've ever hunted</br>   with was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native Americans</span>. And we hunted with bows—crossbows and a bone</br>   arrow. Yeah, with a rifle, I've never shot an animal because I don't do</br>   senseless killing. Even if it's an insect, I just leave him alone. That's</br>   what people tell me like, &quot;Bro, you're the exact opposite of what you look</br>   like. You look like somebody that doesn't give a crap about anything, and</br>   it's just like thugging it out. But in all reality, you're very cautious</br>   about all the other living things.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Yeah, bro, because, I</br>   mean, like who are we to kill an animal? That animal has as much right to</br>   be here as we do. That's not fair to me.” So, they're like, &quot;Bro, you just</br>   crazy.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I like the contrast. You've got all the tattoos on the outside, but</br>   then you're like this sensitive soul on the inside. [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span> laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: But this works for me because the thieves don't bother me. [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span></br>   laughs]. But the real thieves bother me. The cops. Yeah. That's the only</br>   downside about it here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So, you feel like the cops, they target you more?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: They're the real criminals. Even when I was with my ex, we would go</br>   out to a mall—well, they call them plazas here or a park. They would ride</br>   their bikes around me and smell, see if I'm smoking pot or something.</br>   That's the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> thing that they think, and they always get on me for that.</br>   That's always the main thing: this guy has either cocaine, or weed on him,</br>   or a gun. They're always telling me the same thing. They're like, &quot;Where's</br>   the gun? We know you have drugs. Where's the coke?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Man, look,&quot;</br>   and this is going to sound dumb, but even in public, I've pulled my pants</br>   down, and boxers, and lifted up my shirt, and like, &quot;Where's the drugs?</br>   Search everywhere you want to search. I have nothing on me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Cris: And they grab me, and they rough me up, and they're like, &quot;You know</br>   what? Te estas alterando mucho, [foreign language <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:00:16:25]</span>. You're</br>   getting too aggressive with us. We're taking you in.&quot; It's always the same</br>   thing. And I just pray for those guys because at the end of the day, they</br>   don't know any better because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> raises people different. Here people</br>   are struggling. People are starving [inaudible]. Like cops, down here they</br>   don't get paid much. So, they rob people to make ends meet, but then they</br>   get too used to it. They get too used to stealing. It comes easy to them.</br>   So, I just pray for them, man, that hopefully God touches their heart and</br>   softens it because they're just very closed minded, very arrogant,</br>   ignorant, truly. Oh, it's bad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What do you wish that cops, or I guess other people in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> in</br>   general, understood about people like you, returned migrants from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: That it's not our fault. That's one thing I want to change people's</br>   minds, because that's why I like meeting a lot of people. Because every</br>   time I meet somebody and they tell me, &quot;You know what? For a deportee,</br>   you're not what I expected. You're actually a good person. Yeah, you look</br>   like you're about to rob somebody or about to shoot somebody or something.</br>   But oh, you're a really good person.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Oh well, thank you. I</br>   don't try to be. I mean, that just comes natural. I'm not out here forcing</br>   that. It's just that's who I am and thank you.&quot; It makes me feel good when</br>   people say that. I always say thank you. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I wish people here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> would understand that we want to love</br>   this country, but we need them to give us a chance to adapt, and give us</br>   time, have patience with us, because everything we've ever heard about</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is negative. And then we get here, and we see that little by little</br>   we’re seeing it's not all that negative. It's a really good place to be at.</br>   Like me, I don't even want to go home. I love it here. And at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, yeah,</br>   because I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Juarez</span>, where the cartels are and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Veracruz</span> where the</br>   cartels are. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span> was just... Oh, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span> is just beautiful. But everybody</br>   there is so closed-minded with immigrants. They judge me a lot there. A</br>   lot. All my family has kicked me out because of the fact I don't want to</br>   change the way I dress.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I'm like, look, I'm sorry that I don't look approachable. It's just I</br>   dress comfortably. That's it. I dress comfortably. If I wear jeans, I feel</br>   like I'm suffocating, and I can't walk right. And if I wear a button-up</br>   shirt, I feel like... Oh, I don't know. I just feel like I'm trapped in it.</br>   I don't know. It's weird.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Speaking of your shirt, whose face is this?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Kurt Cobain</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay. That's what I thought. I couldn't see it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah. I love <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Kurt Cobain's</span> music because that's actually... Well, I</br>   didn't listen to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Nirvana</span> until after this happened. I was in construction,</br>   and then I heard “<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Teen Spirit</span>.” I was, &quot;Hey, man, that's a really good</br>   song.&quot; I was like, &quot;Who is that?&quot; I've heard it <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> time on the radio, but</br>   I never took a chance to listen to it because I was into rap. That's my</br>   thing. I like to freestyle, and I like to rap. Me and my friends would</br>   always try to make music at home, and we literally just met somebody that</br>   edited a freestyle for us and put a beat to it. So, like, I'm going to put</br>   all my eggs in that basket. So, not counting my chickens before they hatch,</br>   but putting all my eggs in that basket. [Both laugh’.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So, yeah. After this, I was still depressed and stuff because she</br>   didn't get back with me right away, my kid's mom. And yes, I was always</br>   depressed, and I'd hear his music, and I went like, &quot;Wow. You can feel his</br>   music because this is something that he really went through.” Like man,</br>   just so many songs I could name, and I all of them are just awesome. I love</br>   his music.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Which one's your favorite?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: My favorite? I would have to say… I don't know, I think this is the</br>   name of it, “<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Where'd You Sleep Last Night</span>?” Or is it “[Singing] My girl, my</br>   girl. Don't lie to me. Yeah, that one.” I love that song because I can</br>   relate to it because that's why people tell me that I'm stupid, or that I'm</br>   too nice, and my heart's too big because I would always forgive her.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: She's younger than me. I took her out of school to take care of her,</br>   so she didn't get to experience everything I did. So, when we're older, she</br>   cheated on me a lot, and I would always take her back. And I didn't care</br>   about all that. I would tell her, “I love you, and yeah, it hurts, but at</br>   the end of the day you're here with me, and I'll get over it.” So that song</br>   I can really relate to it because it's like I feel him, like I know why he</br>   killed himself. That stuff hurts, man. That was my plan. Even before I knew</br>   what happened to this guy, I thought this guy was alive when I heard this</br>   music. Everyone's like, &quot;He killed himself.&quot; I'm like, &quot;What? Nah, I just</br>   heard his song.&quot; Yeah, but it was an old song.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Oh, shit. I didn't know he was dead. Yeah. And then like, after they</br>   told me, I'm like, ”Damn, what the crap? That's crazy.” I guess he shot</br>   himself. So, I was like, “Dang. I didn't even know that, you know?” But</br>   yeah, that's crazy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You probably feel like you can relate to him.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. I love his music. Yeah. But now since his music is a little bit</br>   more depressing, [Laughing] I try not to listen to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Nirvana</span> too much. I</br>   listen to more like trap music now because it's very upbeat. And I love</br>   trap. I mean, even though the songs that I listen to are still about</br>   heartbreaks and stuff, but at least it's a more...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Different sound?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Yeah. Yeah. So ,it's like more upbeat.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you listen to any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> music or any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Spanish</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latino</span> music?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No, I don't like it. [Laughs]. Starting <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month ago</span>, me and my ex</br>   started going to the clubs and stuff. Right? I like reggaeton. That's the</br>   only <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Latin</span> music. Reggaeton, I love it. I freaking love it. Like [foreign</br>   language <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:22:19</span>]. [Laughs]. So, we would go to the club, and I'm like,</br>   &quot;Oh, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carla</span>, this is actually cool.&quot; I'm sitting there dancing with her and</br>   stuff, and everything's cool. Right? Well, then salsa and cumbia comes on</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Hey, I'm sorry.&quot; And she said, &quot;What?&quot; And then she'd say,</br>   &quot;You don't want to dance with me?&quot; And I'd say, &quot;No, I don't know how to</br>   dance this stuff. Please don't make me try it. I'm not going to embarrass</br>   you.&quot; She would try to teach me, and I learned probably a couple of steps,</br>   but I don't know. Practice makes perfect, I guess, because I suck. And I</br>   guess in order for me to dance to something, I have to like it. If I don't</br>   like the music, then I'm not going to dance to it because I'm dancing to</br>   something I don't like. I can't be a fake person.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You have to feel it.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. I don't do things to fit in. That's actually why I got this.</br>   This is very symbolic.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I haven't asked about the tattoos on your face yet.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: If you want to.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Well, yeah. So here it goes. This one back home, keeping it <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">100</span>,</br>   breaks down like always be honest, never lie, never snitch, never steal. Be</br>   honest to yourself as well, because a lot of people, sometimes they don't</br>   achieve what they want to achieve because they're like, &quot;Nah, I can't do</br>   it.&quot; They don't even try it.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: No dude, like you can do anything you put your mind to. Don't lie to</br>   yourself and tell you I can't do it. Try it, and if you really tried your</br>   best, don't say that you couldn't do it. Just say, I didn't try hard</br>   enough. I'll accept that. But if you say you can't do it, come on, man. I'm</br>   going to slap you upside the head. You can do anything you put your minds</br>   to, brother.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: I tell them all the time that you can do anything you put your mind</br>   to. All you got to do is be focused on that specific thing that you really</br>   want to do, and just put your all into it. So, it breaks down being honest,</br>   loyal and well, yeah, never be fake. It's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">100%</span> real. Don't ever lie just to</br>   fit in. Don't ever go somewhere where you're not uncomfortable just to be</br>   around a certain person or something. If you don't like something and it</br>   doesn't feel right, don't do it even though you're going to get popularity</br>   or whatever. I don't think about that. I don't care about all that stuff. I</br>   cannot be a fake person. That's what this one means, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">a hundred</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Why did you choose to get it right there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Because it's on my face to cover the ugly. [Laughs]. I'm just</br>   kidding. Because, I mean, what's the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> thing that people look at? Your</br>   face. So all my favorite tattoos will be on my face and my head. So right</br>   here I have <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Emily</span>'s name. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Emily</span>. Right here I have her <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> name, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Aliyah</span>.</br>   And then this is her birthday.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">February 2nd, 2016</span>.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. Yeah. I love her. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's really sweet.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So you're back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> now, and you've told me you're not planning</br>   on going back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> So what are your biggest plans for your future,</br>   your hopes, your dreams here?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: So, my dreams here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, first I want to get my passport because</br>   if I have a chance to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Australia</span>, I want to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Australia</span>. That's my</br>   dream to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Australia</span> because they speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and metal framing is a</br>   big business there, and that's right up my alley. I have a passion for</br>   building buildings, starting from concrete, and then erecting a full</br>   building. I take pride in that because I feel good about it. Something that</br>   I did with my own hands from my own knowledge, something that I learned</br>   from somebody else, but I know it, and I have it down. You know what I'm</br>   saying?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you want to go there to live or to visit?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: To live. But if I can't, I would love to stay here. I mean, I love</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, hands down. I love being here. I don't mind if I can't go to</br>   another country. I'm okay with that. If I had to stay here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, my</br>   dreams are to either get into... I've always wanted to be an archeologist</br>   or historian. That's my passion. But my real, real passion that it's</br>   something that I really could get into is culinary arts. I love cooking. I</br>   love cooking. I cook for all my roommates.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What kind of cooking?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Everything, everything. I mean, I've cooked <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native American</span> food,</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> food, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> food. I love grilling. I love smoking meats. I love</br>   that. I can make a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> food with different types. Mostly <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   food because my mama. Yeah. I mean, I just like cooking all kinds of stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So, do you think that's something you would want to get into for a</br>   job or just for fun?</br> </br> </br>   Cris: For a job. Yeah, that'd be cool for a job. Because, I mean, yeah, I'm</br>   doing something I love so it wouldn't be a job, it'd be my passion. Right</br>   now, I love where I work. Call centers. I mean, it's not hard. I'm speaking</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, my native language because it's the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> language I spoke, so I'm</br>   happy where I'm at. But I would be happier as a chef or an archeologist.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So, let's say you open a restaurant <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">some day</span> and I'm back down here,</br>   and I come to your restaurant to eat. What's going to be the star dish? The</br>   famous dish at your restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cris</span>: Star dish? Sweet glazed roasted pork tenderloin. I love making that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: It's so good. It's one of my favorite dishes. Grilled lobster tail, I</br>   like making those. Yeah, meats. [Laughs]. I like barbecue. I love barbecue.</br>   So, one of the main things would be barbecue ribs, baby back ribs, brisket,</br>   pulled pork sandwiches, stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I love it. You're making me hungry for dinner. [Both laugh]. Not a</br>   vegetarian-friendly restaurant, sounds like.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I like that.</br> </br> </br>   Cris: Yeah. I'm a carnivore. [Laughs].</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
