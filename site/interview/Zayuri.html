   I was excited because my dad told us that we were going to be better there,<br>
   that we were going to have more stability and things like that, you know,<br>
   the usual stuff that they tell you. I got here almost three years ago when<br>
   I was around 17, 18. It was really hard because I didn't understand what<br>
   was happening, not fully. I knew that it was because it was better for the<br>
   family, but I did get very angry at the beginning, but—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: When you went to the US or when you came back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: When I came back, I was really angry because I was like 17. So, it<br>
   was a couple of good years, like five years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Isabel: Can you tell me about those five years, some of your favorite</br>   memories, and then maybe some of your kind of challenges while you were in</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Well, my favorite part was obviously the school and everything. I</br>   had a really good job babysitting for a family, and that was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old were the kids you babysat?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: There was a girl. She was around four years old. And there was the</br>   boy. He was around eight or something like that? But they were really calm,</br>   and they were chiller than my brothers. Sometimes I was like, &quot;You guys</br>   need me to babysit?&quot; &quot;No, we're okay right now.&quot; &quot;Are you guys sure?</br>   Because I could go there. I know that I'm like 40 minutes away from you,</br>   but I could go. Really. You just hit me up if you need more.&quot; And 10</br>   minutes later, &quot;Are you sure that you don't need me today?&quot; [Loud voice].</br>   Because my brothers, they're not annoying, but they're very loud,</br>   especially when they're together. So, I was like, &quot;Yeah, I need to get away</br>   from here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Are they older or younger?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, they're younger than me. I'm the first one born, 20 years old</br>   now, and the next one is 17, and the youngest one, he's 10. So, they're</br>   significantly younger than me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Are you just more mellow, like you like things to be calm,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. I don't tolerate noise that much. It really sets me up in a</br>   very mad mood. So, I don't like it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, then you're like, &quot;Really? Are you sure that you don't</br>   need me?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I could literally go right now. I have my backpack with me. Yeah,</br>   because being with them will mean a chill afternoon. I just have to read</br>   for them or help them out with their homework, maybe do some cleaning, make</br>   the dinner, and that was it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's nice.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I will even nap with them because it was that chill. It was fun.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you like the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, I really like kids.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I love hanging out with kids too. You kind of get a break from all</br>   the dynamics of the older people.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, all the adulting and stuff. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's just not nice, right?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No. I just want to make a pillow fort. Leave me alone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. It's just better for me, for my mental health in general</br>   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I</br>   get headaches and stuff. I was like, &quot;Yep, got to get out of here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm the same way.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they</br>   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I</br>   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because</br>   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't</br>   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and</br>   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are</br>   here in Mexico, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's</br>   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes</br>   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, &quot;Why do they</br>   have that and I didn't?&quot; I'm really happy for them. I understand that they</br>   are just getting better.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. I'm sure it's kind of difficult sometimes of you also wanted</br>   those opportunities.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about what you did like to do in the US, even</br>   though you didn't have those opportunities? Do you have any other passions?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: What I didn't like to do?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,</br>   anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and</br>   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and</br>   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a</br>   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh</br>   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do</br>   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just</br>   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now</br>   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to</br>   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me</br>   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One</br>   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't</br>   remember how I figured out that she was German.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses</br>   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a</br>   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge</br>   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you</br>   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting</br>   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the</br>   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say it in German?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I said it in Spanish. She was like, &quot;Okay,&quot; and she sat next to</br>   me. She had this beautiful skirt, and I just said, &quot;Oh, your skirt is so</br>   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In Ireland,&quot; or something</br>   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from Ireland?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from</br>   Germany.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons</br>   from Duolingo? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.&quot; By</br>   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No!</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, that was my chance to make a friend. I'm really shy. It</br>   really causes me to not talk to people. It's really hard for me to do that.</br>   I still have nightmares with that. I was like, &quot;I could have made a good</br>   friend, and I just let it pass.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you've got to seize those moments. But that's kind of what's</br>   cool about knowing different languages is you can connect with different</br>   people, so that's awesome. You mentioned you were kind of shy. Were you</br>   also shy when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends? Did you make friends or more of a loner?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Not that many. I have never made that many friends. And most of my</br>   friends were people I will say that related to me—in a sense that they were</br>   also Latin or Black. We didn't get that many white friends. [Laughs]. Yeah.</br>   Not really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They were not used to us. For example, I remember a girl that she</br>   got really angry when she find out that I was speaking Spanish with another</br>   girl. She was like really annoyed by that, and I was like, &quot;Why do—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Just for the audio, that was a perfectly executed stank eye that</br>   you can't pick up.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Laughs]. I was like, &quot;Why does that upset you that much? We're not</br>   even talking about you, Cynthia. Why do you take it personal?&quot; [Emphasis].</br>   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the</br>   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.</br>   &quot;She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?&quot;</br>   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about</br>   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be</br>   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have</br>   confronted her and be like, &quot;What is your problem with me? Can we make</br>   something about it?&quot; but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired</br>   of it. She didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about just what led to returning to Mexico?</br>   Was it a family decision, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. A friend of mine got deported, and my father got scared of</br>   it—I was about to turn 18, I was like one step away from my birthday. He</br>   said, &quot;I think it's about time for you to go to Mexico.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?</br>   Why me? What did I make this time? I've been a good kid.&quot; I saw it as a</br>   punishment. I was like, &quot;Why did I did wrong? Why do you think that I have</br>   to leave?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was your entire family undocumented at this point?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Sorry, I should have asked this earlier, but did you then cross the</br>   border together?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So, then you were living without the papers and everything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you know that when you went at 12 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I didn't. My father always told me that we had to be very</br>   discreet, keep things private. “If they ask you, you were born here. Don't</br>   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.” He almost made it</br>   look like, &quot;Don't say you're Mexican. Just say you're really tan.&quot; That's</br>   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,</br>   but I'll try.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did that make you really anxious or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an</br>   indigenous woman. My father, he could white pass very easily, but my mom,</br>   no. She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I</br>   live here and I say that, &quot;Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,&quot; she's like,</br>   &quot;Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another</br>   language?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; She didn't really like to mention it.</br>   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that's—</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She told me that she wanted to keep us safe, and that was the</br>   reason. But nowadays she's trying to reconnect with her family and</br>   everything, but it's still quite hard because the family that did stay</br>   here, they're like, &quot;Oh, you guys are so agringados. You think you're</br>   better than us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, really.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when</br>   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,</br>   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you</br>   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to</br>   turn 18. You go to Mexico.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he</br>   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I</br>   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.</br>   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to</br>   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay</br>   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,</br>   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with</br>   them.&quot; So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last</br>   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I</br>   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I</br>   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and</br>   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in</br>   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. So, looking back on it, you said you felt like</br>   you were being punished. Did you know of the DACA program? Was that</br>   available yet or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. When they mentioned… Isabel, was that her name?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Anita. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Anita. She mentioned the DREAMers program. I think I brought it up</br>   once with my dad, but he was like, &quot;No. We have to keep things private.” He</br>   was just private, and he didn't even want to try to get the papers for us.</br>   He said that, &quot;No, we're just going to get a spotlight on us, and that is</br>   going to be dangerous,&quot; and all of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, kind of just sounds like so worried about kind of being</br>   deported or being detected that there wasn't really any opportunities that</br>   you were able to take.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, when you returned to Mexico and you had to adjust to even just</br>   the air quality and everything, did you feel like, &quot;Okay, well I'm</br>   returning to a country I know,&quot; or did you feel like it's been so much time</br>   in the US that this was just completely new to you?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was</br>   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, &quot;Why is this place</br>   like this?” [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my</br>   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I</br>   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get</br>   used to like, &quot;Oh, you can’t go to play basketball at 10:00 PM because</br>   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.&quot;</br>   So, I was like, &quot;Okay. Now what? What do we do?&quot; You just stay in the</br>   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of</br>   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such</br>   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of</br>   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say</br>   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a</br>   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four</br>   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my</br>   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a</br>   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the</br>   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I</br>   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that</br>   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned</br>   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn</br>   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I</br>   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay</br>   that much attention to that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It</br>   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple</br>   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing</br>   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this</br>   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the same day?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw</br>   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even</br>   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,</br>   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't</br>   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was</br>   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do</br>   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both</br>   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,</br>   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure</br>   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do</br>   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right</br>   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was</br>   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my</br>   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,</br>   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were</br>   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police</br>   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't</br>   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,</br>   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if</br>   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press</br>   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that</br>   is my nice phone.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You bought with your own money.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to</br>   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You</br>   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about</br>   it in the morning.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying</br>   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know</br>   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the</br>   beginning.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Kind of zooming out a big, larger reflection question, if you</br>   were in the US, what do you think you'd be doing, or what would you like to</br>   be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: College. Probably going to college. I was just studying chemistry</br>   here in Mexico, but I didn't really even like it that much, and then I was</br>   thinking about something related to environmental science.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That'd be really cool. Would you think more ocean, or would</br>   you go more forest? Does it really matter?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Maybe ocean. Probably ocean.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. There's some really cool stuff. Since you're now in Mexico,</br>   what do you think you hope to do? Do you hope to return to the U.S.? Do you</br>   want to continue your studies here? What do you see for yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, &quot;Okay, I'm</br>   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and</br>   then try to get there,&quot; because it was a struggle even to pay the college</br>   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the</br>   college in the United States. I was thinking of that, just finishing</br>   college in here and trying to go legally back there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why do you want to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I think it will be better. I think I will find a better job. It</br>   seems more realistic to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you connect more with people in the U.S. or in</br>   Mexico, or is it just different?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's different definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. The memes that are funny in Spanish is so hard to translate</br>   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks English and Spanish,</br>   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She</br>   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm</br>   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German</br>   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see</br>   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a 30</br>   minute rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. “You</br>   get it?” “No.” I try. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American, the United</br>   States American, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: That's a hard one. It's quite hard because if you ask people,</br>   they're not even going to... I have asked my cousin, &quot;What do you think of</br>   me? Do you think I sound more American or you think I sound more Mexican?</br>   What do you think?&quot; They were like, &quot;I don't know. You just sound weird.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;That's another point to my self-esteem. Thank you.&quot; Oh god, that</br>   is hard. I'll say I'm more Mexican, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: For example, I try to see more things in Spanish, and I try to be</br>   more connected to the culture and everything. Even in the United States, we</br>   celebrated all the days. We put up an altar on Dia de los Muertos [All</br>   Souls Day] and everything. My father was like, &quot;This is who we are, and</br>   this is what we're going to say.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You said your mom is starting to kind of reconnect with her own</br>   heritage. Do you feel connected with that at all, or have you tried to, or</br>   is that mostly your mother?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I try to, but we see it from very different perspectives. For</br>   example, I took it in a very aesthetic way. That's why I stretch my ears,</br>   and I've got a couple of my piercings. And I have told my mom this, “This</br>   is what was beautiful to us. This is what beauty was to us before all the</br>   colonizing that we had. This is what meant beautiful for us.” She's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's too much.” She will wear the traditional clothes, but she</br>   will look at my body modifications, and she will be like, &quot;Yeah, that's a</br>   little bit too much. Yeah, we get it, but that's it.&quot; Yeah, she doesn't</br>   like them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: When did you decide to get into kind of piercings, or you stretched</br>   your ear, kind of like connect with that part? Do you mind going into that</br>   a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was 16. I was 16, and I remember a guy in my class. He made a</br>   commentary. I think it was about another girl that had been growing her</br>   natural hair, and he was like, &quot;I don't think that that's even hygienic.&quot;</br>   And I was like—because by that time, I was wearing dreads—&quot;What do you mean</br>   by that?&quot; He was like, &quot;I don't know. They just look dirty.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br>   have been closer to her, and I have been close to you, and I think she</br>   smells nicer than you. So, what's the deal with that?&quot; He couldn't even</br>   explain why he thought that that was dirty or that was unhygienic. I was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Now, I remember I told my mom—because she used to braid my</br>   hair—&quot;Why you don't do it anymore?&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you just don't sit</br>   still.&quot; I was like, &quot;I can sit still, but why don't you do it anymore?&quot; She</br>   was trying to make these excuses: “I don't have time for it, and I don't</br>   like it.” Then she said, &quot;I don't think that you're going to look</br>   professional,&quot; and that was what stuck to me because I was just struggling</br>   to get a job by that time. I was like, &quot;What do you mean professionally?&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;People here don't get it. You're not going to look right for</br>   them.&quot; I was like, &quot;What is right?” Because right now it's all dead, but it</br>   can be very curly. I was like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Because she was</br>   constantly pressuring me to get a perm or to constantly straighten it up. I</br>   was like, &quot;You know that that's even damaging for me. I don't even like to</br>   do it. I understand if other people enjoy it, but I don't.&quot; She was like,</br>   &quot;It's just what's better for you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then it went downhill crazy, and I was like, &quot;You know what? People</br>   don't like my hair? Well, they're not going to like my piercings. They are</br>   not going to like my ears. They are not going to like my tattoos and</br>   everything.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you like that you have them now? Is it something you're proud</br>   of?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Are there days where you're like, &quot;Eh?”</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, yeah, I do like them. For example, it has been difficult to</br>   find a job because of it, because of people that are like, &quot;You don't look</br>   professional. I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.&quot; I work here in</br>   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.</br>   She was like, &quot;You need to cover your ears.&quot; She didn't even allow me to</br>   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She was like, &quot;No. You are keeping your hair down, because you</br>   cannot show your ears.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And the same thing for my</br>   tattoos too. She was like, &quot;You need to cover them up because they're not</br>   professional.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's like 40 degrees outside. It's really hot</br>   in here,&quot; especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it</br>   gets so hot in there. I was like, &quot;You see, I'm not even trying to fight</br>   with you anymore.

I'm looking at your tattoos. They're really beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you mind telling me a bit about them or when you got them?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay. This one was the first one. To be honest with you—I don't</br>   regret the piercings, and I don't regret the tattoos that much—I do wish</br>   that I had taken better of them, because I scratched them, and I did lots</br>   of things that you're not supposed to do with tattoos. So, the ink just</br>   blowed up. Yeah, I got this for a very important person of mine. She's my</br>   ... What do you call it? Step-sister? She's the daughter of my father, but</br>   she's not the daughter of my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Step-sister works or half-sister, that thing.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. She's still in the United States. She's trying to get here. I</br>   met her two years ago. Her name is Rosalind. She did help me out a lot of</br>   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on</br>   me. So, I was like, &quot;Yep, I'm going to get a rose,&quot; because I have a great</br>   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.&quot; Then I got this for</br>   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up</br>   because I really hate it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh really?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's very poorly done. This is my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They just changed the eye color because he didn't listen to me. I</br>   gave him the photo, and he was like, &quot;You know what? We should put her with</br>   yellow eyes. That will really bring out the color.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I</br>   think we should stick to the colors on the picture.&quot; But he didn't listen</br>   to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, you're going to have to change that. That's interesting</br>   that he didn't listen to you.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my</br>   father, he has Lupita written out on his arm in this gaudy Cholo letters.</br>   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,</br>   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have</br>   asked him, &quot;Have you ever been to prison?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Where do you got those tattoos?&quot; &quot;In the studio.&quot; They don't look like</br>   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, &quot;When I'm</br>   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something</br>   related to you.&quot; She was like, &quot;No, don't do that.&quot; She doesn't like</br>   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really</br>   upset about it. She was like, &quot;Why did you did that?&quot; So, it was like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;I don't want to get the heart shape.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With the mom?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: With the mom. I think I'm going to have a very imagination, so I</br>   was like, &quot;I am going to get a portrait of her, but not a realistic one</br>   because they feel horrible. They don't last anything.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, I'm going to get it in a traditional way,&quot; and that's what I go.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, did you do that art, or did you just have the designer do it?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I told him what I wanted. I gave him a photo for reference, and I</br>   said, &quot;Just don't make it realistic, and make it on a more traditional</br>   tattoo type.&quot; She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then I got a couple on my legs and on</br>   my feet.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, no, those are really beautiful. Then just some further</br>   in-depth questions, just to kind of zoom out, you're welcome to bring your</br>   own experience into it, but I was just wondering if you have any opinions</br>   kind of how the Mexican government and then how the US government is</br>   handling migration. Is there anything that you would like them to know in</br>   terms of humanizing migrants or how people, even young people in school,</br>   should treat or perceive people from different countries or from Mexico</br>   specifically?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a huge question. Answer it however you want.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't think that they're even trying to handle it anymore. I</br>   think it's just something that they ignore. All of the things that I have</br>   been reading is like, “Yeah, there's migrants in the border, and the</br>   government is trying to set them apart.” I was like, “Besides that, what</br>   else are we doing?” I don't see a strong answer for that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. No, I think that's kind of how I feel too. There seems to be</br>   kind of an idea like, &quot;Oh, you're neither from here nor there,&quot; kind of the</br>   conversation with your cousins. You're either too American to be Mexican or</br>   too Mexican to be American. How do you respond, or what do you think about</br>   kind of that mentality?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="744fad0e-805f-4d33-9077-ec59f89cdc40" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Discrimination/stigmatization, Profiling, Xenophobia, Racism">Zayuri: It's annoying definitely because it downgrades you. It's like<br>
   you're not enough for anyone apparently. Especially in my family, they<br>
   treat you like—they don't even want to listen to it. For example, my<br>
   grandma, the one that is here, she's so annoyed by the whole thing. She<br>
   thinks that all the family that went to the United States and came back ...<br>
   She's like, &quot;Ugh, now they think that they have seen the whole world, and<br>
   now they think that they're better than us.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. So, I can't<br>
   even talk to you about this, right?&quot; And don't even try to mention that you<br>
   miss something about the United States, because she's going to be like,<br>
   &quot;Well, go right there. Go back. What are you doing in here?&quot; I was like,<br>

   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm<br>
   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German<br>
   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see<br>
   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a 30<br>

   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In Ireland,&quot; or something<br>
   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from Ireland?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from<br>
   Germany.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons<br>

   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.&quot; I was like,<br>

   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a<br>
   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge<br>
   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you<br>
   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting<br>
   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the<br>
   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;<br>

I'm the first one born, 20 years old</br>   now, and the next one is 17, and the youngest one, he's 10. So, they're</br>   significantly younger than me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Are you just more mellow, like you like things to be calm,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. I don't tolerate noise that much. It really sets me up in a</br>   very mad mood. So, I don't like it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, then you're like, &quot;Really? Are you sure that you don't</br>   need me?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I could literally go right now.

It was fun.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you like the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, I really like kids.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I love hanging out with kids too. You kind of get a break from all</br>   the dynamics of the older people.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, all the adulting and stuff. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's just not nice, right?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No. I just want to make a pillow fort. Leave me alone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. It's just better for me, for my mental health in general</br>   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I</br>   get headaches and stuff. I was like, &quot;Yep, got to get out of here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm the same way.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they</br>   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I</br>   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because</br>   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't</br>   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and</br>   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are</br>   here in Mexico, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's</br>   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes</br>   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, &quot;Why do they</br>   have that and I didn't?&quot; I'm really happy for them. I understand that they</br>   are just getting better.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. I'm sure it's kind of difficult sometimes of you also wanted</br>   those opportunities.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about what you did like to do in the US, even</br>   though you didn't have those opportunities? Do you have any other passions?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: What I didn't like to do?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,</br>   anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and</br>   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and</br>   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a</br>   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh</br>   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do</br>   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just</br>   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now</br>   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to</br>   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me</br>   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One</br>   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't</br>   remember how I figured out that she was German.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses</br>   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a</br>   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge</br>   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you</br>   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting</br>   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the</br>   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say it in German?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I said it in Spanish. She was like, &quot;Okay,&quot; and she sat next to</br>   me. She had this beautiful skirt, and I just said, &quot;Oh, your skirt is so</br>   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In Ireland,&quot; or something</br>   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from Ireland?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from</br>   Germany.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons</br>   from Duolingo? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.&quot; By</br>   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No!</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, that was my chance to make a friend. I'm really shy. It</br>   really causes me to not talk to people. It's really hard for me to do that.</br>   I still have nightmares with that. I was like, &quot;I could have made a good</br>   friend, and I just let it pass.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you've got to seize those moments. But that's kind of what's</br>   cool about knowing different languages is you can connect with different</br>   people, so that's awesome. You mentioned you were kind of shy. Were you</br>   also shy when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends? Did you make friends or more of a loner?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Not that many. I have never made that many friends. And most of my</br>   friends were people I will say that related to me—in a sense that they were</br>   also Latin or Black. We didn't get that many white friends. [Laughs]. Yeah.</br>   Not really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They were not used to us. For example, I remember a girl that she</br>   got really angry when she find out that I was speaking Spanish with another</br>   girl. She was like really annoyed by that, and I was like, &quot;Why do—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Just for the audio, that was a perfectly executed stank eye that</br>   you can't pick up.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Laughs]. I was like, &quot;Why does that upset you that much? We're not</br>   even talking about you, Cynthia. Why do you take it personal?&quot; [Emphasis].</br>   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the</br>   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.</br>   &quot;She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?&quot;</br>   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about</br>   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be</br>   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have</br>   confronted her and be like, &quot;What is your problem with me? Can we make</br>   something about it?&quot; but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired</br>   of it. She didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about just what led to returning to Mexico?</br>   Was it a family decision, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. A friend of mine got deported, and my father got scared of</br>   it—I was about to turn 18, I was like one step away from my birthday. He</br>   said, &quot;I think it's about time for you to go to Mexico.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?</br>   Why me? What did I make this time? I've been a good kid.&quot; I saw it as a</br>   punishment. I was like, &quot;Why did I did wrong? Why do you think that I have</br>   to leave?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was your entire family undocumented at this point?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Sorry, I should have asked this earlier, but did you then cross the</br>   border together?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So, then you were living without the papers and everything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you know that when you went at 12 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I didn't. My father always told me that we had to be very</br>   discreet, keep things private. “If they ask you, you were born here. Don't</br>   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.” He almost made it</br>   look like, &quot;Don't say you're Mexican. Just say you're really tan.&quot; That's</br>   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,</br>   but I'll try.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did that make you really anxious or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an</br>   indigenous woman. My father, he could white pass very easily, but my mom,</br>   no. She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I</br>   live here and I say that, &quot;Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,&quot; she's like,</br>   &quot;Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another</br>   language?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; She didn't really like to mention it.</br>   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that's—</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She told me that she wanted to keep us safe, and that was the</br>   reason. But nowadays she's trying to reconnect with her family and</br>   everything, but it's still quite hard because the family that did stay</br>   here, they're like, &quot;Oh, you guys are so agringados. You think you're</br>   better than us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, really.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when</br>   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,</br>   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you</br>   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to</br>   turn 18. You go to Mexico.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he</br>   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I</br>   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.</br>   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to</br>   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay</br>   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,</br>   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with</br>   them.&quot; So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last</br>   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I</br>   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I</br>   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and</br>   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in</br>   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. So, looking back on it, you said you felt like</br>   you were being punished. Did you know of the DACA program? Was that</br>   available yet or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. When they mentioned… Isabel, was that her name?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Anita. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Anita. She mentioned the DREAMers program. I think I brought it up</br>   once with my dad, but he was like, &quot;No. We have to keep things private.” He</br>   was just private, and he didn't even want to try to get the papers for us.</br>   He said that, &quot;No, we're just going to get a spotlight on us, and that is</br>   going to be dangerous,&quot; and all of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, kind of just sounds like so worried about kind of being</br>   deported or being detected that there wasn't really any opportunities that</br>   you were able to take.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, when you returned to Mexico and you had to adjust to even just</br>   the air quality and everything, did you feel like, &quot;Okay, well I'm</br>   returning to a country I know,&quot; or did you feel like it's been so much time</br>   in the US that this was just completely new to you?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was</br>   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, &quot;Why is this place</br>   like this?” [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my</br>   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I</br>   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get</br>   used to like, &quot;Oh, you can’t go to play basketball at 10:00 PM because</br>   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.&quot;</br>   So, I was like, &quot;Okay. Now what? What do we do?&quot; You just stay in the</br>   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of</br>   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such</br>   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of</br>   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say</br>   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a</br>   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four</br>   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my</br>   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a</br>   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the</br>   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I</br>   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that</br>   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned</br>   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn</br>   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I</br>   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay</br>   that much attention to that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It</br>   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple</br>   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing</br>   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this</br>   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the same day?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw</br>   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even</br>   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,</br>   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't</br>   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was</br>   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do</br>   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both</br>   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,</br>   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure</br>   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do</br>   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right</br>   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was</br>   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my</br>   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,</br>   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were</br>   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police</br>   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't</br>   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,</br>   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if</br>   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press</br>   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that</br>   is my nice phone.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You bought with your own money.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to</br>   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You</br>   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about</br>   it in the morning.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying</br>   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know</br>   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the</br>   beginning.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Kind of zooming out a big, larger reflection question, if you</br>   were in the US, what do you think you'd be doing, or what would you like to</br>   be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: College. Probably going to college. I was just studying chemistry</br>   here in Mexico, but I didn't really even like it that much, and then I was</br>   thinking about something related to environmental science.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That'd be really cool. Would you think more ocean, or would</br>   you go more forest? Does it really matter?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Maybe ocean. Probably ocean.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. There's some really cool stuff. Since you're now in Mexico,</br>   what do you think you hope to do? Do you hope to return to the U.S.? Do you</br>   want to continue your studies here? What do you see for yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, &quot;Okay, I'm</br>   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and</br>   then try to get there,&quot; because it was a struggle even to pay the college</br>   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the</br>   college in the United States. I was thinking of that, just finishing</br>   college in here and trying to go legally back there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why do you want to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I think it will be better. I think I will find a better job. It</br>   seems more realistic to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you connect more with people in the U.S. or in</br>   Mexico, or is it just different?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's different definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. The memes that are funny in Spanish is so hard to translate</br>   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks English and Spanish,</br>   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She</br>   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm</br>   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German</br>   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see</br>   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a 30</br>   minute rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. “You</br>   get it?” “No.” I try. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American, the United</br>   States American, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: That's a hard one. It's quite hard because if you ask people,</br>   they're not even going to... I have asked my cousin, &quot;What do you think of</br>   me? Do you think I sound more American or you think I sound more Mexican?</br>   What do you think?&quot; They were like, &quot;I don't know. You just sound weird.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;That's another point to my self-esteem. Thank you.&quot; Oh god, that</br>   is hard. I'll say I'm more Mexican, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: For example, I try to see more things in Spanish, and I try to be</br>   more connected to the culture and everything. Even in the United States, we</br>   celebrated all the days. We put up an altar on Dia de los Muertos [All</br>   Souls Day] and everything. My father was like, &quot;This is who we are, and</br>   this is what we're going to say.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You said your mom is starting to kind of reconnect with her own</br>   heritage. Do you feel connected with that at all, or have you tried to, or</br>   is that mostly your mother?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I try to, but we see it from very different perspectives. For</br>   example, I took it in a very aesthetic way. That's why I stretch my ears,</br>   and I've got a couple of my piercings. And I have told my mom this, “This</br>   is what was beautiful to us. This is what beauty was to us before all the</br>   colonizing that we had. This is what meant beautiful for us.” She's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's too much.” She will wear the traditional clothes, but she</br>   will look at my body modifications, and she will be like, &quot;Yeah, that's a</br>   little bit too much. Yeah, we get it, but that's it.&quot; Yeah, she doesn't</br>   like them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: When did you decide to get into kind of piercings, or you stretched</br>   your ear, kind of like connect with that part? Do you mind going into that</br>   a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was 16. I was 16, and I remember a guy in my class. He made a</br>   commentary. I think it was about another girl that had been growing her</br>   natural hair, and he was like, &quot;I don't think that that's even hygienic.&quot;</br>   And I was like—because by that time, I was wearing dreads—&quot;What do you mean</br>   by that?&quot; He was like, &quot;I don't know. They just look dirty.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br>   have been closer to her, and I have been close to you, and I think she</br>   smells nicer than you. So, what's the deal with that?&quot; He couldn't even</br>   explain why he thought that that was dirty or that was unhygienic. I was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Now, I remember I told my mom—because she used to braid my</br>   hair—&quot;Why you don't do it anymore?&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you just don't sit</br>   still.&quot; I was like, &quot;I can sit still, but why don't you do it anymore?&quot; She</br>   was trying to make these excuses: “I don't have time for it, and I don't</br>   like it.” Then she said, &quot;I don't think that you're going to look</br>   professional,&quot; and that was what stuck to me because I was just struggling</br>   to get a job by that time. I was like, &quot;What do you mean professionally?&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;People here don't get it. You're not going to look right for</br>   them.&quot; I was like, &quot;What is right?” Because right now it's all dead, but it</br>   can be very curly. I was like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Because she was</br>   constantly pressuring me to get a perm or to constantly straighten it up. I</br>   was like, &quot;You know that that's even damaging for me. I don't even like to</br>   do it. I understand if other people enjoy it, but I don't.&quot; She was like,</br>   &quot;It's just what's better for you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then it went downhill crazy, and I was like, &quot;You know what? People</br>   don't like my hair? Well, they're not going to like my piercings. They are</br>   not going to like my ears. They are not going to like my tattoos and</br>   everything.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you like that you have them now? Is it something you're proud</br>   of?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Are there days where you're like, &quot;Eh?”</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, yeah, I do like them. For example, it has been difficult to</br>   find a job because of it, because of people that are like, &quot;You don't look</br>   professional. I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.&quot; I work here in</br>   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.</br>   She was like, &quot;You need to cover your ears.&quot; She didn't even allow me to</br>   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She was like, &quot;No. You are keeping your hair down, because you</br>   cannot show your ears.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And the same thing for my</br>   tattoos too. She was like, &quot;You need to cover them up because they're not</br>   professional.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's like 40 degrees outside. It's really hot</br>   in here,&quot; especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it</br>   gets so hot in there. I was like, &quot;You see, I'm not even trying to fight</br>   with you anymore. I'm going to die of a heat stroke if you don't allow me</br>   to take my jacket off.&quot; But she was very rude about that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, were you a teacher then for her, or what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I was a teacher in her school.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, cool. Are you currently?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you're not? No.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. It was way too much. She even made me cry about it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm looking for a job right now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm curious. I'm looking at your tattoos. They're really beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you mind telling me a bit about them or when you got them?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay. This one was the first one. To be honest with you—I don't</br>   regret the piercings, and I don't regret the tattoos that much—I do wish</br>   that I had taken better of them, because I scratched them, and I did lots</br>   of things that you're not supposed to do with tattoos. So, the ink just</br>   blowed up. Yeah, I got this for a very important person of mine. She's my</br>   ... What do you call it? Step-sister? She's the daughter of my father, but</br>   she's not the daughter of my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Step-sister works or half-sister, that thing.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. She's still in the United States. She's trying to get here. I</br>   met her two years ago. Her name is Rosalind. She did help me out a lot of</br>   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on</br>   me. So, I was like, &quot;Yep, I'm going to get a rose,&quot; because I have a great</br>   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.&quot; Then I got this for</br>   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up</br>   because I really hate it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh really?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's very poorly done. This is my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They just changed the eye color because he didn't listen to me. I</br>   gave him the photo, and he was like, &quot;You know what? We should put her with</br>   yellow eyes. That will really bring out the color.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I</br>   think we should stick to the colors on the picture.&quot; But he didn't listen</br>   to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, you're going to have to change that. That's interesting</br>   that he didn't listen to you.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my</br>   father, he has Lupita written out on his arm in this gaudy Cholo letters.</br>   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,</br>   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have</br>   asked him, &quot;Have you ever been to prison?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Where do you got those tattoos?&quot; &quot;In the studio.&quot; They don't look like</br>   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, &quot;When I'm</br>   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something</br>   related to you.&quot; She was like, &quot;No, don't do that.&quot; She doesn't like</br>   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really</br>   upset about it. She was like, &quot;Why did you did that?&quot; So, it was like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;I don't want to get the heart shape.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With the mom?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: With the mom. I think I'm going to have a very imagination, so I</br>   was like, &quot;I am going to get a portrait of her, but not a realistic one</br>   because they feel horrible. They don't last anything.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, I'm going to get it in a traditional way,&quot; and that's what I go.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, did you do that art, or did you just have the designer do it?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I told him what I wanted. I gave him a photo for reference, and I</br>   said, &quot;Just don't make it realistic, and make it on a more traditional</br>   tattoo type.&quot; She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then I got a couple on my legs and on</br>   my feet.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, no, those are really beautiful. Then just some further</br>   in-depth questions, just to kind of zoom out, you're welcome to bring your</br>   own experience into it, but I was just wondering if you have any opinions</br>   kind of how the Mexican government and then how the US government is</br>   handling migration. Is there anything that you would like them to know in</br>   terms of humanizing migrants or how people, even young people in school,</br>   should treat or perceive people from different countries or from Mexico</br>   specifically?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a huge question. Answer it however you want.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't think that they're even trying to handle it anymore. I</br>   think it's just something that they ignore. All of the things that I have</br>   been reading is like, “Yeah, there's migrants in the border, and the</br>   government is trying to set them apart.” I was like, “Besides that, what</br>   else are we doing?” I don't see a strong answer for that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. No, I think that's kind of how I feel too. There seems to be</br>   kind of an idea like, &quot;Oh, you're neither from here nor there,&quot; kind of the</br>   conversation with your cousins. You're either too American to be Mexican or</br>   too Mexican to be American. How do you respond, or what do you think about</br>   kind of that mentality?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's annoying definitely because it downgrades you. It's like</br>   you're not enough for anyone apparently. Especially in my family, they</br>   treat you like—they don't even want to listen to it. For example, my</br>   grandma, the one that is here, she's so annoyed by the whole thing. She</br>   thinks that all the family that went to the United States and came back ...</br>   She's like, &quot;Ugh, now they think that they have seen the whole world, and</br>   now they think that they're better than us.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. So, I can't</br>   even talk to you about this, right?&quot; And don't even try to mention that you</br>   miss something about the United States, because she's going to be like,</br>   &quot;Well, go right there. Go back. What are you doing in here?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's the same thing that I question.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, yeah. Probably asking yourself that too.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="ba748fa9-384e-41c8-bd81-3f649251566d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Friendship,  difficulty, Sadness, Mixed-status, The United States">Isabel: Well, if there's anything else you'd like to add, or you want<br>
   people to know before we wrap up?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: What else? I mean, it's hard, really hard trying to leave<br>
   everything. For example, my dad, I remember that he told us, &quot;Don't even<br>
   get too attached to your friends because you don't know if tomorrow we're<br>
   still going to be here.&quot; So, it was like, “That's nice advice for my first<br>
   day to school. Thank you. I'll make the best that I can with that.” So, I<br>
   remember, that even talking to people for me was like, “What's the point?<br>
   Am I going to see you next week? Probably not.”?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Not allowing yourself to get attached.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: To anyone, even on a friendship level. I was like, &quot;What's the<br>
   point?&quot; For example, I could never had friends over because my dad didn't<br>
   even like us to share the address. Because we were living on part that was<br>
   full of other migrants, so he was like, &quot;No, there's no gringos coming out<br>
   to this area. You don't know how they're going to react. If something<br>
   happens to them, and they're in the whole right to do it, but they try to<br>
   call the police, you don't know what kind of problems we can get into.&quot;<br>
   That was like, &quot;Okay. So, no friends over. Can I go to other friends?&quot; &quot;No.<br>
   No, no, no, no, no.&quot; So, you'd have to have McDonald's and go back here<br>
   before sunset. All right. And that was the way to go. [Interview ends<br>
   00:40:</span><span id="8e09f624-e729-40ba-8adc-bc244a28cfe0" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Interactions with police, Profiling, Mistrust, Mexico">Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of<br>
   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such<br>
   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of<br>
   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say<br>
   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a<br>
   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four<br>
   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my<br>
   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a<br>
   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the<br>
   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I<br>
   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that<br>
   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned<br>
   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn<br>
   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,<br>
   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I<br>
   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay<br>
   that much attention to that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It<br>
   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple<br>
   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,<br>
   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing<br>
   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this<br>
   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: In the same day?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw<br>
   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even<br>
   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,<br>
   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't<br>
   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was<br>
   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do<br>
   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both<br>
   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,<br>
   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure<br>
   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do<br>
   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right<br>
   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was<br>
   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my<br>
   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,<br>
   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were<br>
   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was<br>
   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,<br>
   &quot;Okay.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police<br>
   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't<br>
   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,<br>
   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if<br>
   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press<br>
   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that<br>
   is my nice phone.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: You bought with your own money.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to<br>
   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You<br>
   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about<br>
   it in the morning.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying<br>
   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know<br>
   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the<br>
   beginning.<br>

Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when<br>
   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,<br>
   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you<br>
   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to<br>
   turn 18. You go to Mexico.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he<br>
   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,<br>
   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I<br>
   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I<br>
   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.<br>
   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to<br>
   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: No, I know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay<br>
   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,<br>
   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with<br>
   them.&quot; So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last<br>
   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: What was difficult?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I<br>
   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I<br>
   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and<br>
   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in<br>
   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="4d0b15a3-061d-40db-a2c7-dd3c87f98f24" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Hobbies, Language">Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,<br>
   anything like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and<br>
   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Of what?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and<br>
   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a<br>
   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh<br>
   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do<br>
   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just<br>
   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now<br>
   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to<br>
   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me<br>
   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One<br>
   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't<br>
   remember how I figured out that she was German.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="42b69ac2-ff11-448c-93c8-2b28ce75983e" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mental Health, Education">Zayuri: Yeah. It's just better for me, for my mental health in general<br>
   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I<br>
   get headaches and stuff. I was like, &quot;Yep, got to get out of here.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: I'm the same way.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they<br>
   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I<br>
   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because<br>
   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't<br>
   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and<br>
   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are<br>
   here in Mexico, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's<br>
   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes<br>
   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, &quot;Why do they<br>
   have that and I didn't?&quot; I'm really happy for them. I understand that they<br>
   are just getting better.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Isabel: Yeah. I'm sure it's kind of difficult sometimes of you also wanted</br>   those opportunities.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about what you did like to do in the US, even</br>   though you didn't have those opportunities? Do you have any other passions?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: What I didn't like to do?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,</br>   anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and</br>   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and</br>   all of that. But I wasn't even that good.

Now, I've been trying to</br>   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me</br>   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One</br>   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't</br>   remember how I figured out that she was German.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses</br>   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a</br>   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge</br>   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you</br>   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting</br>   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the</br>   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say it in German?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I said it in Spanish. She was like, &quot;Okay,&quot; and she sat next to</br>   me. She had this beautiful skirt, and I just said, &quot;Oh, your skirt is so</br>   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In Ireland,&quot; or something</br>   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from Ireland?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from</br>   Germany.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons</br>   from Duolingo? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.&quot; By</br>   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No!</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, that was my chance to make a friend. I'm really shy. It</br>   really causes me to not talk to people. It's really hard for me to do that.</br>   I still have nightmares with that. I was like, &quot;I could have made a good</br>   friend, and I just let it pass.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you've got to seize those moments. But that's kind of what's</br>   cool about knowing different languages is you can connect with different</br>   people, so that's awesome. You mentioned you were kind of shy. Were you</br>   also shy when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends? Did you make friends or more of a loner?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Not that many. I have never made that many friends. And most of my</br>   friends were people I will say that related to me—in a sense that they were</br>   also Latin or Black. We didn't get that many white friends. [Laughs]. Yeah.</br>   Not really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They were not used to us. For example, I remember a girl that she</br>   got really angry when she find out that I was speaking Spanish with another</br>   girl. She was like really annoyed by that, and I was like, &quot;Why do—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Just for the audio, that was a perfectly executed stank eye that</br>   you can't pick up.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Laughs]. I was like, &quot;Why does that upset you that much? We're not</br>   even talking about you, Cynthia. Why do you take it personal?&quot; [Emphasis].</br>   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the</br>   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.</br>   &quot;She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?&quot;</br>   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about</br>   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be</br>   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have</br>   confronted her and be like, &quot;What is your problem with me? Can we make</br>   something about it?&quot; but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired</br>   of it. She didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about just what led to returning to Mexico?</br>   Was it a family decision, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. A friend of mine got deported, and my father got scared of</br>   it—I was about to turn 18, I was like one step away from my birthday. He</br>   said, &quot;I think it's about time for you to go to Mexico.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?</br>   Why me? What did I make this time? I've been a good kid.&quot; I saw it as a</br>   punishment. I was like, &quot;Why did I did wrong? Why do you think that I have</br>   to leave?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was your entire family undocumented at this point?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Sorry, I should have asked this earlier, but did you then cross the</br>   border together?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So, then you were living without the papers and everything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you know that when you went at 12 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I didn't. My father always told me that we had to be very</br>   discreet, keep things private. “If they ask you, you were born here. Don't</br>   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.” He almost made it</br>   look like, &quot;Don't say you're Mexican. Just say you're really tan.&quot; That's</br>   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,</br>   but I'll try.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did that make you really anxious or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an</br>   indigenous woman. My father, he could white pass very easily, but my mom,</br>   no. She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I</br>   live here and I say that, &quot;Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,&quot; she's like,</br>   &quot;Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another</br>   language?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; She didn't really like to mention it.</br>   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that's—</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She told me that she wanted to keep us safe, and that was the</br>   reason. But nowadays she's trying to reconnect with her family and</br>   everything, but it's still quite hard because the family that did stay</br>   here, they're like, &quot;Oh, you guys are so agringados. You think you're</br>   better than us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, really.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when</br>   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,</br>   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you</br>   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to</br>   turn 18. You go to Mexico.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he</br>   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I</br>   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.</br>   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to</br>   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay</br>   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,</br>   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with</br>   them.&quot; So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last</br>   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I</br>   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I</br>   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and</br>   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in</br>   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. So, looking back on it, you said you felt like</br>   you were being punished. Did you know of the DACA program? Was that</br>   available yet or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. When they mentioned… Isabel, was that her name?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Anita. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Anita. She mentioned the DREAMers program. I think I brought it up</br>   once with my dad, but he was like, &quot;No. We have to keep things private.” He</br>   was just private, and he didn't even want to try to get the papers for us.</br>   He said that, &quot;No, we're just going to get a spotlight on us, and that is</br>   going to be dangerous,&quot; and all of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, kind of just sounds like so worried about kind of being</br>   deported or being detected that there wasn't really any opportunities that</br>   you were able to take.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, when you returned to Mexico and you had to adjust to even just</br>   the air quality and everything, did you feel like, &quot;Okay, well I'm</br>   returning to a country I know,&quot; or did you feel like it's been so much time</br>   in the US that this was just completely new to you?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was</br>   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, &quot;Why is this place</br>   like this?” [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my</br>   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I</br>   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get</br>   used to like, &quot;Oh, you can’t go to play basketball at 10:00 PM because</br>   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.&quot;</br>   So, I was like, &quot;Okay. Now what? What do we do?&quot; You just stay in the</br>   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of</br>   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such</br>   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of</br>   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say</br>   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a</br>   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four</br>   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my</br>   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a</br>   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the</br>   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I</br>   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that</br>   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned</br>   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn</br>   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I</br>   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay</br>   that much attention to that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It</br>   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple</br>   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing</br>   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this</br>   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the same day?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw</br>   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even</br>   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,</br>   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't</br>   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was</br>   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do</br>   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both</br>   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,</br>   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure</br>   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do</br>   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right</br>   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was</br>   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my</br>   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,</br>   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were</br>   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police</br>   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't</br>   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,</br>   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if</br>   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press</br>   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that</br>   is my nice phone.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You bought with your own money.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to</br>   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You</br>   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about</br>   it in the morning.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying</br>   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know</br>   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the</br>   beginning.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Kind of zooming out a big, larger reflection question, if you</br>   were in the US, what do you think you'd be doing, or what would you like to</br>   be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: College. Probably going to college. I was just studying chemistry</br>   here in Mexico, but I didn't really even like it that much, and then I was</br>   thinking about something related to environmental science.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That'd be really cool. Would you think more ocean, or would</br>   you go more forest? Does it really matter?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Maybe ocean. Probably ocean.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. There's some really cool stuff. Since you're now in Mexico,</br>   what do you think you hope to do? Do you hope to return to the U.S.? Do you</br>   want to continue your studies here? What do you see for yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, &quot;Okay, I'm</br>   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and</br>   then try to get there,&quot; because it was a struggle even to pay the college</br>   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the</br>   college in the United States. I was thinking of that, just finishing</br>   college in here and trying to go legally back there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why do you want to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I think it will be better. I think I will find a better job. It</br>   seems more realistic to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you connect more with people in the U.S. or in</br>   Mexico, or is it just different?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's different definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. The memes that are funny in Spanish is so hard to translate</br>   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks English and Spanish,</br>   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She</br>   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm</br>   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German</br>   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see</br>   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a 30</br>   minute rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. “You</br>   get it?” “No.” I try. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American, the United</br>   States American, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: That's a hard one. It's quite hard because if you ask people,</br>   they're not even going to... I have asked my cousin, &quot;What do you think of</br>   me? Do you think I sound more American or you think I sound more Mexican?</br>   What do you think?&quot; They were like, &quot;I don't know. You just sound weird.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;That's another point to my self-esteem. Thank you.&quot; Oh god, that</br>   is hard. I'll say I'm more Mexican, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: For example, I try to see more things in Spanish, and I try to be</br>   more connected to the culture and everything. Even in the United States, we</br>   celebrated all the days. We put up an altar on Dia de los Muertos [All</br>   Souls Day] and everything. My father was like, &quot;This is who we are, and</br>   this is what we're going to say.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You said your mom is starting to kind of reconnect with her own</br>   heritage. Do you feel connected with that at all, or have you tried to, or</br>   is that mostly your mother?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I try to, but we see it from very different perspectives. For</br>   example, I took it in a very aesthetic way. That's why I stretch my ears,</br>   and I've got a couple of my piercings. And I have told my mom this, “This</br>   is what was beautiful to us. This is what beauty was to us before all the</br>   colonizing that we had. This is what meant beautiful for us.” She's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's too much.” She will wear the traditional clothes, but she</br>   will look at my body modifications, and she will be like, &quot;Yeah, that's a</br>   little bit too much. Yeah, we get it, but that's it.&quot; Yeah, she doesn't</br>   like them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: When did you decide to get into kind of piercings, or you stretched</br>   your ear, kind of like connect with that part? Do you mind going into that</br>   a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was 16. I was 16, and I remember a guy in my class. He made a</br>   commentary. I think it was about another girl that had been growing her</br>   natural hair, and he was like, &quot;I don't think that that's even hygienic.&quot;</br>   And I was like—because by that time, I was wearing dreads—&quot;What do you mean</br>   by that?&quot; He was like, &quot;I don't know. They just look dirty.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br>   have been closer to her, and I have been close to you, and I think she</br>   smells nicer than you. So, what's the deal with that?&quot; He couldn't even</br>   explain why he thought that that was dirty or that was unhygienic. I was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Now, I remember I told my mom—because she used to braid my</br>   hair—&quot;Why you don't do it anymore?&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you just don't sit</br>   still.&quot; I was like, &quot;I can sit still, but why don't you do it anymore?&quot; She</br>   was trying to make these excuses: “I don't have time for it, and I don't</br>   like it.” Then she said, &quot;I don't think that you're going to look</br>   professional,&quot; and that was what stuck to me because I was just struggling</br>   to get a job by that time. I was like, &quot;What do you mean professionally?&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;People here don't get it. You're not going to look right for</br>   them.&quot; I was like, &quot;What is right?” Because right now it's all dead, but it</br>   can be very curly. I was like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Because she was</br>   constantly pressuring me to get a perm or to constantly straighten it up. I</br>   was like, &quot;You know that that's even damaging for me. I don't even like to</br>   do it. I understand if other people enjoy it, but I don't.&quot; She was like,</br>   &quot;It's just what's better for you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then it went downhill crazy, and I was like, &quot;You know what? People</br>   don't like my hair? Well, they're not going to like my piercings. They are</br>   not going to like my ears. They are not going to like my tattoos and</br>   everything.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you like that you have them now? Is it something you're proud</br>   of?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Are there days where you're like, &quot;Eh?”</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, yeah, I do like them. For example, it has been difficult to</br>   find a job because of it, because of people that are like, &quot;You don't look</br>   professional. I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.&quot; I work here in</br>   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.</br>   She was like, &quot;You need to cover your ears.&quot; She didn't even allow me to</br>   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She was like, &quot;No. You are keeping your hair down, because you</br>   cannot show your ears.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And the same thing for my</br>   tattoos too. She was like, &quot;You need to cover them up because they're not</br>   professional.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's like 40 degrees outside. It's really hot</br>   in here,&quot; especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it</br>   gets so hot in there. I was like, &quot;You see, I'm not even trying to fight</br>   with you anymore. I'm going to die of a heat stroke if you don't allow me</br>   to take my jacket off.&quot; But she was very rude about that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, were you a teacher then for her, or what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I was a teacher in her school.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, cool. Are you currently?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you're not? No.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. It was way too much. She even made me cry about it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm looking for a job right now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm curious. I'm looking at your tattoos. They're really beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you mind telling me a bit about them or when you got them?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay. This one was the first one. To be honest with you—I don't</br>   regret the piercings, and I don't regret the tattoos that much—I do wish</br>   that I had taken better of them, because I scratched them, and I did lots</br>   of things that you're not supposed to do with tattoos. So, the ink just</br>   blowed up. Yeah, I got this for a very important person of mine. She's my</br>   ... What do you call it? Step-sister? She's the daughter of my father, but</br>   she's not the daughter of my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Step-sister works or half-sister, that thing.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. She's still in the United States. She's trying to get here. I</br>   met her two years ago. Her name is Rosalind. She did help me out a lot of</br>   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on</br>   me. So, I was like, &quot;Yep, I'm going to get a rose,&quot; because I have a great</br>   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.&quot; Then I got this for</br>   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up</br>   because I really hate it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh really?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's very poorly done. This is my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They just changed the eye color because he didn't listen to me. I</br>   gave him the photo, and he was like, &quot;You know what? We should put her with</br>   yellow eyes. That will really bring out the color.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I</br>   think we should stick to the colors on the picture.&quot; But he didn't listen</br>   to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, you're going to have to change that. That's interesting</br>   that he didn't listen to you.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my</br>   father, he has Lupita written out on his arm in this gaudy Cholo letters.</br>   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,</br>   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have</br>   asked him, &quot;Have you ever been to prison?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Where do you got those tattoos?&quot; &quot;In the studio.&quot; They don't look like</br>   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, &quot;When I'm</br>   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something</br>   related to you.&quot; She was like, &quot;No, don't do that.&quot; She doesn't like</br>   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really</br>   upset about it. She was like, &quot;Why did you did that?&quot; So, it was like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;I don't want to get the heart shape.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With the mom?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: With the mom. I think I'm going to have a very imagination, so I</br>   was like, &quot;I am going to get a portrait of her, but not a realistic one</br>   because they feel horrible. They don't last anything.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, I'm going to get it in a traditional way,&quot; and that's what I go.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, did you do that art, or did you just have the designer do it?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I told him what I wanted. I gave him a photo for reference, and I</br>   said, &quot;Just don't make it realistic, and make it on a more traditional</br>   tattoo type.&quot; She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then I got a couple on my legs and on</br>   my feet.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, no, those are really beautiful. Then just some further</br>   in-depth questions, just to kind of zoom out, you're welcome to bring your</br>   own experience into it, but I was just wondering if you have any opinions</br>   kind of how the Mexican government and then how the US government is</br>   handling migration. Is there anything that you would like them to know in</br>   terms of humanizing migrants or how people, even young people in school,</br>   should treat or perceive people from different countries or from Mexico</br>   specifically?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a huge question. Answer it however you want.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't think that they're even trying to handle it anymore. I</br>   think it's just something that they ignore. All of the things that I have</br>   been reading is like, “Yeah, there's migrants in the border, and the</br>   government is trying to set them apart.” I was like, “Besides that, what</br>   else are we doing?” I don't see a strong answer for that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. No, I think that's kind of how I feel too. There seems to be</br>   kind of an idea like, &quot;Oh, you're neither from here nor there,&quot; kind of the</br>   conversation with your cousins. You're either too American to be Mexican or</br>   too Mexican to be American. How do you respond, or what do you think about</br>   kind of that mentality?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's annoying definitely because it downgrades you. It's like</br>   you're not enough for anyone apparently. Especially in my family, they</br>   treat you like—they don't even want to listen to it. For example, my</br>   grandma, the one that is here, she's so annoyed by the whole thing. She</br>   thinks that all the family that went to the United States and came back ...</br>   She's like, &quot;Ugh, now they think that they have seen the whole world, and</br>   now they think that they're better than us.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. So, I can't</br>   even talk to you about this, right?&quot; And don't even try to mention that you</br>   miss something about the United States, because she's going to be like,</br>   &quot;Well, go right there. Go back. What are you doing in here?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's the same thing that I question.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, yeah. Probably asking yourself that too.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Well, if there's anything else you'd like to add, or you want</br>   people to know before we wrap up?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: What else? I mean, it's hard, really hard trying to leave</br>   everything. For example, my dad, I remember that he told us, &quot;Don't even</br>   get too attached to your friends because you don't know if tomorrow we're</br>   still going to be here.&quot; So, it was like, “That's nice advice for my first</br>   day to school. Thank you. I'll make the best that I can with that.” So, I</br>   remember, that even talking to people for me was like, “What's the point?</br>   Am I going to see you next week? Probably not.”?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Not allowing yourself to get attached.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: To anyone, even on a friendship level. I was like, &quot;What's the</br>   point?&quot; For example, I could never had friends over because my dad didn't</br>   even like us to share the address. Because we were living on part that was</br>   full of other migrants, so he was like, &quot;No, there's no gringos coming out</br>   to this area. You don't know how they're going to react. If something</br>   happens to them, and they're in the whole right to do it, but they try to</br>   call the police, you don't know what kind of problems we can get into.&quot;</br>   That was like, &quot;Okay. So, no friends over. Can I go to other friends?&quot; &quot;No.</br>   No, no, no, no, no.&quot; So, you'd have to have McDonald's and go back here</br>   before sunset. All right. And that was the way to go. [Interview ends</br>   00:40:08].</br> </div><\p>
