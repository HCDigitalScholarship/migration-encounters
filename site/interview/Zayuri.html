I was around 12 years old when we got there. I remember that</br>   I was excited because my dad told us that we were going to be better there,</br>   that we were going to have more stability and things like that, you know,</br>   the usual stuff that they tell you. I got here <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">almost three years ago</span> when</br>   I was around 17, 18. It was really hard because I didn't understand what</br>   was happening, not fully. I knew that it was because it was better for the</br>   family, but I did get very angry at the beginning, but—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: When you went to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> or when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: When I came back, I was really angry because I was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17</span>. So, it</br>   was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a couple of good years</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like five years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Can you tell me about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">those five years</span>, some of your favorite</br>   memories, and then maybe some of your kind of challenges while you were in</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Well, my favorite part was obviously the school and everything. I</br>   had a really good job babysitting for a family, and that was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: How old were the kids you babysat?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: There was a girl. She was around four years old. And there was the</br>   boy. He was around eight or something like that? But they were really calm,</br>   and they were chiller than my brothers. Sometimes I was like, &quot;You guys</br>   need me to babysit?&quot; &quot;No, we're okay right now.&quot; &quot;Are you guys sure?</br>   Because I could go there. I know that I'm like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">40 minutes</span> away from you,</br>   but I could go. Really. You just hit me up if you need more.&quot; And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">10   minutes later</span>, &quot;Are you sure that you don't need me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">today</span>?&quot; [Loud voice].</br>   Because my brothers, they're not annoying, but they're very loud,</br>   especially when they're together. So, I was like, &quot;Yeah, I need to get away</br>   from here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Are they older or younger?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No, they're younger than me. I'm the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> one born, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">20 years old</span></br>   now, and the next one is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17</span>, and the youngest one, he's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10</span>. So, they're</br>   significantly younger than me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Are you just more mellow, like you like things to be calm,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah. I don't tolerate noise that much. It really sets me up in a</br>   very mad mood. So, I don't like it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. So, then you're like, &quot;Really? Are you sure that you don't</br>   need me?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I could literally go right now. I have my backpack with me. Yeah,</br>   because being with them will mean <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a chill afternoon</span>. I just have to read</br>   for them or help them out with their homework, maybe do some cleaning, make</br>   the dinner, and that was it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: That's nice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I will even nap with them because it was that chill. It was fun.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you like the kids?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah, I really like kids.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: I love hanging out with kids too. You kind of get a break from all</br>   the dynamics of the older people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah, all the adulting and stuff. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: I know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No, it's just not nice, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: No. I just want to make a pillow fort. Leave me alone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah. It's just better for me, for my mental health in general</br>   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I</br>   get headaches and stuff. I was like, &quot;Yep, got to get out of here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: I'm the same way.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they</br>   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I</br>   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because</br>   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't</br>   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and</br>   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's</br>   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes</br>   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, &quot;Why do they</br>   have that and I didn't?&quot; I'm really happy for them. I understand that they</br>   are just getting better.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. I'm sure it's kind of difficult sometimes of you also wanted</br>   those opportunities.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Can you tell me a bit about what you did like to do in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, even</br>   though you didn't have those opportunities? Do you have any other passions?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: What I didn't like to do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,</br>   anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and</br>   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and</br>   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a</br>   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh</br>   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do</br>   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just</br>   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now</br>   I only speak good <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. That's it. Now, I've been trying to</br>   learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">German</span> for like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> and a half, but on my own completely, just me</br>   and the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Duolingo</span> and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span></br>   time I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Zacatecas</span> and I saw a girl, and she was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">German</span>—I don't</br>   remember how I figured out that she was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">German</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Zacatecas</span> have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a</br>   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge</br>   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you</br>   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting</br>   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the</br>   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you say it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">German</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No, I said it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. She was like, &quot;Okay,&quot; and she sat next to</br>   me. She had this beautiful skirt, and I just said, &quot;Oh, your skirt is so</br>   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Ireland</span>,&quot; or something</br>   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Ireland</span>?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Germany</span>.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span> lessons</br>   from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Duolingo</span>? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">German</span>.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.&quot; By</br>   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: No!</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah, that was my chance to make a friend. I'm really shy. It</br>   really causes me to not talk to people. It's really hard for me to do that.</br>   I still have nightmares with that. I was like, &quot;I could have made a good</br>   friend, and I just let it pass.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, you've got to seize those moments. But that's kind of what's</br>   cool about knowing different languages is you can connect with different</br>   people, so that's awesome. You mentioned you were kind of shy. Were you</br>   also shy when you were in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you have friends? Did you make friends or more of a loner?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Not that many. I have never made that many friends. And most of my</br>   friends were people I will say that related to me—in a sense that they were</br>   also <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latin</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Black</span>. We didn't get that many white friends. [Laughs]. Yeah.</br>   Not really.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: They were not used to us. For example, I remember a girl that she</br>   got really angry when she find out that I was speaking <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> with another</br>   girl. She was like really annoyed by that, and I was like, &quot;Why do—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Just for the audio, that was a perfectly executed stank eye that</br>   you can't pick up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: [Laughs]. I was like, &quot;Why does that upset you that much? We're not</br>   even talking about you, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cynthia</span>. Why do you take it personal?&quot; [Emphasis].</br>   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the</br>   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.</br>   &quot;She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?&quot;</br>   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about</br>   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be</br>   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have</br>   confronted her and be like, &quot;What is your problem with me? Can we make</br>   something about it?&quot; but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired</br>   of it. She didn't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Can you tell me a bit about just what led to returning to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br>   Was it a family decision, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah. A friend of mine got deported, and my father got scared of</br>   it—I was about to turn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>, I was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> step away from my birthday. He</br>   said, &quot;I think it's about time for you to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?</br>   Why me? What did I make this time? I've been a good kid.&quot; I saw it as a</br>   punishment. I was like, &quot;Why did I did wrong? Why do you think that I have</br>   to leave?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Was your entire family undocumented at this point?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Sorry, I should have asked this earlier, but did you then cross the</br>   border together?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Okay. So, then you were living without the papers and everything?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you know that when you went at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12 years old</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No, I didn't. My father always told me that we had to be very</br>   discreet, keep things private. “If they ask you, you were born here. Don't</br>   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.” He almost made it</br>   look like, &quot;Don't say you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. Just say you're really tan.&quot; That's</br>   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,</br>   but I'll try.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did that make you really anxious or anything?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an</br>   indigenous woman. My father, he could white pass very easily, but my mom,</br>   no. She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I</br>   live here and I say that, &quot;Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,&quot; she's like,</br>   &quot;Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another</br>   language?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; She didn't really like to mention it.</br>   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Why do you think that's—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: She told me that she wanted to keep us safe, and that was the</br>   reason. But nowadays she's trying to reconnect with her family and</br>   everything, but it's still quite hard because the family that did stay</br>   here, they're like, &quot;Oh, you guys are so agringados. You think you're</br>   better than us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, really.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when</br>   someone spends time in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, then everyone assumes, oh,</br>   because you lived in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> for a while, you think you're better or you</br>   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to</br>   turn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>. You go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he</br>   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I</br>   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.</br>   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to</br>   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: No, I know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay</br>   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>,</br>   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with</br>   them.&quot; So, I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Zacatecas</span>, and I got into college. I didn't even last</br>   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What was difficult?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I</br>   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I</br>   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and</br>   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in</br>   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, absolutely. So, looking back on it, you said you felt like</br>   you were being punished. Did you know of the DACA program? Was that</br>   available yet or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: No?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No. When they mentioned… <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>, was that her name?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>. She mentioned the DREAMers program. I think I brought it up</br>   once with my dad, but he was like, &quot;No. We have to keep things private.” He</br>   was just private, and he didn't even want to try to get the papers for us.</br>   He said that, &quot;No, we're just going to get a spotlight on us, and that is</br>   going to be dangerous,&quot; and all of that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, kind of just sounds like so worried about kind of being</br>   deported or being detected that there wasn't really any opportunities that</br>   you were able to take.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So, when you returned to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and you had to adjust to even just</br>   the air quality and everything, did you feel like, &quot;Okay, well I'm</br>   returning to a country I know,&quot; or did you feel like it's been so much time</br>   in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> that this was just completely new to you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was</br>   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, &quot;Why is this place</br>   like this?” [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my</br>   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I</br>   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get</br>   used to like, &quot;Oh, you can’t go to play basketball at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">10:00 PM</span> because</br>   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.&quot;</br>   So, I was like, &quot;Okay. Now what? What do we do?&quot; You just stay in the</br>   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a couple of   </span>months ago, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like two months ago</span>, I got robbed here. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">That whole day</span> was such</br>   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of</br>   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> phones by this time. I will say</br>   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a</br>   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like four   years</span>. It was first the phone of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of my uncles. Then he gave it to my</br>   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a</br>   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the</br>   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">that day</span>, I</br>   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that</br>   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned</br>   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn</br>   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I</br>   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay</br>   that much attention to that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It</br>   wasn't even that late at night. It was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">9:00</span>. There was still a couple</br>   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing</br>   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this</br>   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the same day</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw</br>   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even</br>   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,</br>   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't</br>   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was</br>   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do</br>   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both</br>   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,</br>   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Pat down or legally search?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure</br>   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do</br>   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right</br>   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was</br>   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my</br>   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,</br>   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were</br>   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police</br>   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't</br>   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,</br>   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if</br>   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press</br>   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that</br>   is my nice phone.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: You bought with your own money.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to</br>   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You</br>   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about</br>   it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">the morning</span>.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">the morning</span>, I was crying</br>   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know</br>   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the</br>   beginning.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Kind of zooming out a big, larger reflection question, if you</br>   were in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, what do you think you'd be doing, or what would you like to</br>   be doing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: College. Probably going to college. I was just studying chemistry</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, but I didn't really even like it that much, and then I was</br>   thinking about something related to environmental science.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. That'd be really cool. Would you think more ocean, or would</br>   you go more forest? Does it really matter?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Maybe ocean. Probably ocean.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. There's some really cool stuff. Since you're now in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>,</br>   what do you think you hope to do? Do you hope to return to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>? Do you</br>   want to continue your studies here? What do you see for yourself?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, &quot;Okay, I'm</br>   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and</br>   then try to get there,&quot; because it was a struggle even to pay the college</br>   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the</br>   college in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. I was thinking of that, just finishing</br>   college in here and trying to go legally back there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Why do you want to go back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I think it will be better. I think I will find a better job. It</br>   seems more realistic to me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Do you feel like you connect more with people in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> or in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, or is it just different?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: It's different definitely.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah. The memes that are funny in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> is so hard to translate</br>   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>,</br>   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She</br>   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm</br>   laughing at a meme from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> or even worse ones, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">German</span></br>   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see</br>   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">30   minute</span> rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. “You</br>   get it?” “No.” I try. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I get it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Do you consider yourself more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: That's a hard one. It's quite hard because if you ask people,</br>   they're not even going to... I have asked my cousin, &quot;What do you think of</br>   me? Do you think I sound more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> or you think I sound more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br>   What do you think?&quot; They were like, &quot;I don't know. You just sound weird.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;That's another point to my self-esteem. Thank you.&quot; Oh god, that</br>   is hard. I'll say I'm more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: For example, I try to see more things in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, and I try to be</br>   more connected to the culture and everything. Even in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, we</br>   celebrated all the days. We put up an altar on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Dia de los Muertos [All   Souls Day</span>] and everything. My father was like, &quot;This is who we are, and</br>   this is what we're going to say.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: You said your mom is starting to kind of reconnect with her own</br>   heritage. Do you feel connected with that at all, or have you tried to, or</br>   is that mostly your mother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I try to, but we see it from very different perspectives. For</br>   example, I took it in a very aesthetic way. That's why I stretch my ears,</br>   and I've got a couple of my piercings. And I have told my mom this, “This</br>   is what was beautiful to us. This is what beauty was to us before all the</br>   colonizing that we had. This is what meant beautiful for us.” She's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's too much.” She will wear the traditional clothes, but she</br>   will look at my body modifications, and she will be like, &quot;Yeah, that's a</br>   little bit too much. Yeah, we get it, but that's it.&quot; Yeah, she doesn't</br>   like them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: When did you decide to get into kind of piercings, or you stretched</br>   your ear, kind of like connect with that part? Do you mind going into that</br>   a bit?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">16</span>. I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">16</span>, and I remember a guy in my class. He made a</br>   commentary. I think it was about another girl that had been growing her</br>   natural hair, and he was like, &quot;I don't think that that's even hygienic.&quot;</br>   And I was like—because by that time, I was wearing dreads—&quot;What do you mean</br>   by that?&quot; He was like, &quot;I don't know. They just look dirty.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br>   have been closer to her, and I have been close to you, and I think she</br>   smells nicer than you. So, what's the deal with that?&quot; He couldn't even</br>   explain why he thought that that was dirty or that was unhygienic. I was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Now, I remember I told my mom—because she used to braid my</br>   hair—&quot;Why you don't do it anymore?&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you just don't sit</br>   still.&quot; I was like, &quot;I can sit still, but why don't you do it anymore?&quot; She</br>   was trying to make these excuses: “I don't have time for it, and I don't</br>   like it.” Then she said, &quot;I don't think that you're going to look</br>   professional,&quot; and that was what stuck to me because I was just struggling</br>   to get a job by that time. I was like, &quot;What do you mean professionally?&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;People here don't get it. You're not going to look right for</br>   them.&quot; I was like, &quot;What is right?” Because right now it's all dead, but it</br>   can be very curly. I was like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Because she was</br>   constantly pressuring me to get a perm or to constantly straighten it up. I</br>   was like, &quot;You know that that's even damaging for me. I don't even like to</br>   do it. I understand if other people enjoy it, but I don't.&quot; She was like,</br>   &quot;It's just what's better for you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Then it went downhill crazy, and I was like, &quot;You know what? People</br>   don't like my hair? Well, they're not going to like my piercings. They are</br>   not going to like my ears. They are not going to like my tattoos and</br>   everything.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Do you like that you have them now? Is it something you're proud</br>   of?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Are there <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">days</span> where you're like, &quot;Eh?”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No, yeah, I do like them. For example, it has been difficult to</br>   find a job because of it, because of people that are like, &quot;You don't look</br>   professional. I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.&quot; I work here in</br>   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.</br>   She was like, &quot;You need to cover your ears.&quot; She didn't even allow me to</br>   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: She was like, &quot;No. You are keeping your hair down, because you</br>   cannot show your ears.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And the same thing for my</br>   tattoos too. She was like, &quot;You need to cover them up because they're not</br>   professional.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">40 degrees</span> outside. It's really hot</br>   in here,&quot; especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it</br>   gets so hot in there. I was like, &quot;You see, I'm not even trying to fight</br>   with you anymore. I'm going to die of a heat stroke if you don't allow me</br>   to take my jacket off.&quot; But she was very rude about that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So, were you a teacher then for her, or what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No, I was a teacher in her school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, cool. Are you currently?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, you're not? No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: No. It was way too much. She even made me cry about it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I'm looking for a job right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: I'm curious. I'm looking at your tattoos. They're really beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Do you mind telling me a bit about them or when you got them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Okay. This one was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> one. To be honest with you—I don't</br>   regret the piercings, and I don't regret the tattoos that much—I do wish</br>   that I had taken better of them, because I scratched them, and I did lots</br>   of things that you're not supposed to do with tattoos. So, the ink just</br>   blowed up. Yeah, I got this for a very important person of mine. She's my</br>   ... What do you call it? Step-sister? She's the daughter of my father, but</br>   she's not the daughter of my mom.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Step-sister works or half-sister, that thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah. She's still in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. She's trying to get here. I</br>   met her <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years ago</span>. Her name is <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rosalind</span>. She did help me out a lot of</br>   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on</br>   me. So, I was like, &quot;Yep, I'm going to get a rose,&quot; because I have a great</br>   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.&quot; Then I got this for</br>   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up</br>   because I really hate it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh really?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: It's very poorly done. This is my mom.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: They just changed the eye color because he didn't listen to me. I</br>   gave him the photo, and he was like, &quot;You know what? We should put her with</br>   yellow eyes. That will really bring out the color.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I</br>   think we should stick to the colors on the picture.&quot; But he didn't listen</br>   to me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. So, you're going to have to change that. That's interesting</br>   that he didn't listen to you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my</br>   father, he has <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lupita</span> written out on his arm in this gaudy <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cholo</span> letters.</br>   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,</br>   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have</br>   asked him, &quot;Have you ever been to prison?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Where do you got those tattoos?&quot; &quot;In the studio.&quot; They don't look like</br>   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, &quot;When I'm</br>   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something</br>   related to you.&quot; She was like, &quot;No, don't do that.&quot; She doesn't like</br>   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really</br>   upset about it. She was like, &quot;Why did you did that?&quot; So, it was like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;I don't want to get the heart shape.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: With the mom?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: With the mom. I think I'm going to have a very imagination, so I</br>   was like, &quot;I am going to get a portrait of her, but not a realistic one</br>   because they feel horrible. They don't last anything.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, I'm going to get it in a traditional way,&quot; and that's what I go.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So, did you do that art, or did you just have the designer do it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I told him what I wanted. I gave him a photo for reference, and I</br>   said, &quot;Just don't make it realistic, and make it on a more traditional</br>   tattoo type.&quot; She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then I got a couple on my legs and on</br>   my feet.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Very cool.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, no, those are really beautiful. Then just some further</br>   in-depth questions, just to kind of zoom out, you're welcome to bring your</br>   own experience into it, but I was just wondering if you have any opinions</br>   kind of how the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government and then how the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> government is</br>   handling migration. Is there anything that you would like them to know in</br>   terms of humanizing migrants or how people, even young people in school,</br>   should treat or perceive people from different countries or from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   specifically?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: It's a huge question. Answer it however you want.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: I don't think that they're even trying to handle it anymore. I</br>   think it's just something that they ignore. All of the things that I have</br>   been reading is like, “Yeah, there's migrants in the border, and the</br>   government is trying to set them apart.” I was like, “Besides that, what</br>   else are we doing?” I don't see a strong answer for that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. No, I think that's kind of how I feel too. There seems to be</br>   kind of an idea like, &quot;Oh, you're neither from here nor there,&quot; kind of the</br>   conversation with your cousins. You're either too <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or</br>   too <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. How do you respond, or what do you think about</br>   kind of that mentality?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: It's annoying definitely because it downgrades you. It's like</br>   you're not enough for anyone apparently. Especially in my family, they</br>   treat you like—they don't even want to listen to it. For example, my</br>   grandma, the one that is here, she's so annoyed by the whole thing. She</br>   thinks that all the family that went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> and came back ...</br>   She's like, &quot;Ugh, now they think that they have seen the whole world, and</br>   now they think that they're better than us.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. So, I can't</br>   even talk to you about this, right?&quot; And don't even try to mention that you</br>   miss something about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, because she's going to be like,</br>   &quot;Well, go right there. Go back. What are you doing in here?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's the same thing that I question.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, yeah. Probably asking yourself that too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Well, if there's anything else you'd like to add, or you want</br>   people to know before we wrap up?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: What else? I mean, it's hard, really hard trying to leave</br>   everything. For example, my dad, I remember that he told us, &quot;Don't even</br>   get too attached to your friends because you don't know if tomorrow we're</br>   still going to be here.&quot; So, it was like, “That's nice advice for my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   day to school. Thank you. I'll make the best that I can with that.” So, I</br>   remember, that even talking to people for me was like, “What's the point?</br>   Am I going to see you <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next week</span>? Probably not.”?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Not allowing yourself to get attached.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Zayuri</span>: To anyone, even on a friendship level. I was like, &quot;What's the</br>   point?&quot; For example, I could never had friends over because my dad didn't</br>   even like us to share the address. Because we were living on part that was</br>   full of other migrants, so he was like, &quot;No, there's no gringos coming out</br>   to this area. You don't know how they're going to react. If something</br>   happens to them, and they're in the whole right to do it, but they try to</br>   call the police, you don't know what kind of problems we can get into.&quot;</br>   That was like, &quot;Okay. So, no friends over. Can I go to other friends?&quot; &quot;No.</br>   No, no, no, no, no.&quot; So, you'd have to have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">McDonald</span>'s and go back here</br>   before sunset. All right. And that was the way to go. [Interview ends</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:40:08</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="States, First impressions, Return to Mexico,  Upset">Zayuri: Okay. I was around 12 years old when we got there. I remember that   I was excited because my dad told us that we were going to be better there,   that we were going to have more stability and things like that, you know,   the usual stuff that they tell you. I got here almost three years ago when   I was around 17, 18. It was really hard because I didn't understand what   was happening, not fully. I knew that it was because it was better for the   family, but I did get very angry at the beginning, but—     Isabel: When you went to the US or when you came back?     Zayuri: When I came back, I was really angry because I was like 17. So, it   was a couple of good years, like five years.    </span> Isabel: Can you tell me about those five years, some of your favorite</br>   memories, and then maybe some of your kind of challenges while you were in</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Well, my favorite part was obviously the school and everything. I</br>   had a really good job babysitting for a family, and that was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old were the kids you babysat?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: There was a girl. She was around four years old. And there was the</br>   boy. He was around eight or something like that? But they were really calm,</br>   and they were chiller than my brothers. Sometimes I was like, &quot;You guys</br>   need me to babysit?&quot; &quot;No, we're okay right now.&quot; &quot;Are you guys sure?</br>   Because I could go there. I know that I'm like 40 minutes away from you,</br>   but I could go. Really. You just hit me up if you need more.&quot; And 10</br>   minutes later, &quot;Are you sure that you don't need me today?&quot; [Loud voice].</br>   Because my brothers, they're not annoying, but they're very loud,</br>   especially when they're together. So, I was like, &quot;Yeah, I need to get away</br>   from here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Are they older or younger?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, they're younger than me. I'm the first one born, 20 years old</br>   now, and the next one is 17, and the youngest one, he's 10. So, they're</br>   significantly younger than me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Are you just more mellow, like you like things to be calm,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. I don't tolerate noise that much. It really sets me up in a</br>   very mad mood. So, I don't like it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, then you're like, &quot;Really? Are you sure that you don't</br>   need me?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I could literally go right now. I have my backpack with me. Yeah,</br>   because being with them will mean a chill afternoon. I just have to read</br>   for them or help them out with their homework, maybe do some cleaning, make</br>   the dinner, and that was it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's nice.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I will even nap with them because it was that chill. It was fun.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you like the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, I really like kids.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I love hanging out with kids too. You kind of get a break from all</br>   the dynamics of the older people.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, all the adulting and stuff. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's just not nice, right?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No. I just want to make a pillow fort. Leave me alone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. It's just better for me, for my mental health in general</br>   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I</br>   get headaches and stuff. I was like, &quot;Yep, got to get out of here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm the same way.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they</br>   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I</br>   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because</br>   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't</br>   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and</br>   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are</br>   here in Mexico, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's</br>   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes</br>   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, &quot;Why do they</br>   have that and I didn't?&quot; I'm really happy for them. I understand that they</br>   are just getting better.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. I'm sure it's kind of difficult sometimes of you also wanted</br>   those opportunities.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about what you did like to do in the US, even</br>   though you didn't have those opportunities? Do you have any other passions?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: What I didn't like to do?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,</br>   anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and</br>   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and</br>   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a</br>   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh</br>   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do</br>   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just</br>   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now</br>   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to</br>   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me</br>   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One</br>   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't</br>   remember how I figured out that she was German.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses</br>   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a</br>   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge</br>   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you</br>   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting</br>   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the</br>   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say it in German?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I said it in Spanish. She was like, &quot;Okay,&quot; and she sat next to</br>   me. She had this beautiful skirt, and I just said, &quot;Oh, your skirt is so</br>   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In Ireland,&quot; or something</br>   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from Ireland?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from</br>   Germany.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons</br>   from Duolingo? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.&quot; By</br>   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No!</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, that was my chance to make a friend. I'm really shy. It</br>   really causes me to not talk to people. It's really hard for me to do that.</br>   I still have nightmares with that. I was like, &quot;I could have made a good</br>   friend, and I just let it pass.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you've got to seize those moments. But that's kind of what's</br>   cool about knowing different languages is you can connect with different</br>   people, so that's awesome. You mentioned you were kind of shy. Were you</br>   also shy when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends? Did you make friends or more of a loner?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Not that many. I have never made that many friends. And most of my</br>   friends were people I will say that related to me—in a sense that they were</br>   also Latin or Black. We didn't get that many white friends. [Laughs]. Yeah.</br>   Not really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They were not used to us. For example, I remember a girl that she</br>   got really angry when she find out that I was speaking Spanish with another</br>   girl. She was like really annoyed by that, and I was like, &quot;Why do—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Just for the audio, that was a perfectly executed stank eye that</br>   you can't pick up.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Laughs]. I was like, &quot;Why does that upset you that much? We're not</br>   even talking about you, Cynthia. Why do you take it personal?&quot; [Emphasis].</br>   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the</br>   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.</br>   &quot;She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?&quot;</br>   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about</br>   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be</br>   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have</br>   confronted her and be like, &quot;What is your problem with me? Can we make</br>   something about it?&quot; but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired</br>   of it. She didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about just what led to returning to Mexico?</br>   Was it a family decision, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. A friend of mine got deported, and my father got scared of</br>   it—I was about to turn 18, I was like one step away from my birthday. He</br>   said, &quot;I think it's about time for you to go to Mexico.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?</br>   Why me? What did I make this time? I've been a good kid.&quot; I saw it as a</br>   punishment. I was like, &quot;Why did I did wrong? Why do you think that I have</br>   to leave?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was your entire family undocumented at this point?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Sorry, I should have asked this earlier, but did you then cross the</br>   border together?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So, then you were living without the papers and everything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you know that when you went at 12 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I didn't. My father always told me that we had to be very</br>   discreet, keep things private. “If they ask you, you were born here. Don't</br>   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.” He almost made it</br>   look like, &quot;Don't say you're Mexican. Just say you're really tan.&quot; That's</br>   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,</br>   but I'll try.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did that make you really anxious or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an</br>   indigenous woman. My father, he could white pass very easily, but my mom,</br>   no. She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I</br>   live here and I say that, &quot;Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,&quot; she's like,</br>   &quot;Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another</br>   language?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; She didn't really like to mention it.</br>   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that's—</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She told me that she wanted to keep us safe, and that was the</br>   reason. But nowadays she's trying to reconnect with her family and</br>   everything, but it's still quite hard because the family that did stay</br>   here, they're like, &quot;Oh, you guys are so agringados. You think you're</br>   better than us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, really.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when</br>   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,</br>   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you</br>   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to</br>   turn 18. You go to Mexico.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he</br>   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I</br>   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.</br>   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to</br>   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay</br>   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,</br>   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with</br>   them.&quot; So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last</br>   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I</br>   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I</br>   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and</br>   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in</br>   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. So, looking back on it, you said you felt like</br>   you were being punished. Did you know of the DACA program? Was that</br>   available yet or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. When they mentioned… Isabel, was that her name?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Anita. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Anita. She mentioned the DREAMers program. I think I brought it up</br>   once with my dad, but he was like, &quot;No. We have to keep things private.” He</br>   was just private, and he didn't even want to try to get the papers for us.</br>   He said that, &quot;No, we're just going to get a spotlight on us, and that is</br>   going to be dangerous,&quot; and all of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, kind of just sounds like so worried about kind of being</br>   deported or being detected that there wasn't really any opportunities that</br>   you were able to take.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, when you returned to Mexico and you had to adjust to even just</br>   the air quality and everything, did you feel like, &quot;Okay, well I'm</br>   returning to a country I know,&quot; or did you feel like it's been so much time</br>   in the US that this was just completely new to you?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was</br>   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, &quot;Why is this place</br>   like this?” [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my</br>   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I</br>   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get</br>   used to like, &quot;Oh, you can’t go to play basketball at 10:00 PM because</br>   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.&quot;</br>   So, I was like, &quot;Okay. Now what? What do we do?&quot; You just stay in the</br>   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of</br>   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such</br>   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of</br>   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say</br>   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a</br>   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four</br>   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my</br>   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a</br>   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the</br>   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I</br>   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that</br>   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned</br>   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn</br>   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I</br>   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay</br>   that much attention to that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It</br>   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple</br>   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing</br>   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this</br>   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the same day?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw</br>   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even</br>   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,</br>   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't</br>   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was</br>   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do</br>   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both</br>   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,</br>   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure</br>   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do</br>   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right</br>   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was</br>   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my</br>   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,</br>   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were</br>   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police</br>   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't</br>   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,</br>   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if</br>   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press</br>   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that</br>   is my nice phone.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You bought with your own money.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to</br>   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You</br>   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about</br>   it in the morning.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying</br>   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know</br>   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the</br>   beginning.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Kind of zooming out a big, larger reflection question, if you</br>   were in the US, what do you think you'd be doing, or what would you like to</br>   be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: College. Probably going to college. I was just studying chemistry</br>   here in Mexico, but I didn't really even like it that much, and then I was</br>   thinking about something related to environmental science.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That'd be really cool. Would you think more ocean, or would</br>   you go more forest? Does it really matter?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Maybe ocean. Probably ocean.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. There's some really cool stuff. Since you're now in Mexico,</br>   what do you think you hope to do? Do you hope to return to the U.S.? Do you</br>   want to continue your studies here? What do you see for yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, &quot;Okay, I'm</br>   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and</br>   then try to get there,&quot; because it was a struggle even to pay the college</br>   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the</br>   college in the United States. I was thinking of that, just finishing</br>   college in here and trying to go legally back there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why do you want to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I think it will be better. I think I will find a better job. It</br>   seems more realistic to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you connect more with people in the U.S. or in</br>   Mexico, or is it just different?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's different definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. The memes that are funny in Spanish is so hard to translate</br>   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks English and Spanish,</br>   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She</br>   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm</br>   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German</br>   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see</br>   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a 30</br>   minute rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. “You</br>   get it?” “No.” I try. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American, the United</br>   States American, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: That's a hard one. It's quite hard because if you ask people,</br>   they're not even going to... I have asked my cousin, &quot;What do you think of</br>   me? Do you think I sound more American or you think I sound more Mexican?</br>   What do you think?&quot; They were like, &quot;I don't know. You just sound weird.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;That's another point to my self-esteem. Thank you.&quot; Oh god, that</br>   is hard. I'll say I'm more Mexican, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: For example, I try to see more things in Spanish, and I try to be</br>   more connected to the culture and everything. Even in the United States, we</br>   celebrated all the days. We put up an altar on Dia de los Muertos [All</br>   Souls Day] and everything. My father was like, &quot;This is who we are, and</br>   this is what we're going to say.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You said your mom is starting to kind of reconnect with her own</br>   heritage. Do you feel connected with that at all, or have you tried to, or</br>   is that mostly your mother?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I try to, but we see it from very different perspectives. For</br>   example, I took it in a very aesthetic way. That's why I stretch my ears,</br>   and I've got a couple of my piercings. And I have told my mom this, “This</br>   is what was beautiful to us. This is what beauty was to us before all the</br>   colonizing that we had. This is what meant beautiful for us.” She's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's too much.” She will wear the traditional clothes, but she</br>   will look at my body modifications, and she will be like, &quot;Yeah, that's a</br>   little bit too much. Yeah, we get it, but that's it.&quot; Yeah, she doesn't</br>   like them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: When did you decide to get into kind of piercings, or you stretched</br>   your ear, kind of like connect with that part? Do you mind going into that</br>   a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was 16. I was 16, and I remember a guy in my class. He made a</br>   commentary. I think it was about another girl that had been growing her</br>   natural hair, and he was like, &quot;I don't think that that's even hygienic.&quot;</br>   And I was like—because by that time, I was wearing dreads—&quot;What do you mean</br>   by that?&quot; He was like, &quot;I don't know. They just look dirty.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br>   have been closer to her, and I have been close to you, and I think she</br>   smells nicer than you. So, what's the deal with that?&quot; He couldn't even</br>   explain why he thought that that was dirty or that was unhygienic. I was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Now, I remember I told my mom—because she used to braid my</br>   hair—&quot;Why you don't do it anymore?&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you just don't sit</br>   still.&quot; I was like, &quot;I can sit still, but why don't you do it anymore?&quot; She</br>   was trying to make these excuses: “I don't have time for it, and I don't</br>   like it.” Then she said, &quot;I don't think that you're going to look</br>   professional,&quot; and that was what stuck to me because I was just struggling</br>   to get a job by that time. I was like, &quot;What do you mean professionally?&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;People here don't get it. You're not going to look right for</br>   them.&quot; I was like, &quot;What is right?” Because right now it's all dead, but it</br>   can be very curly. I was like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Because she was</br>   constantly pressuring me to get a perm or to constantly straighten it up. I</br>   was like, &quot;You know that that's even damaging for me. I don't even like to</br>   do it. I understand if other people enjoy it, but I don't.&quot; She was like,</br>   &quot;It's just what's better for you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then it went downhill crazy, and I was like, &quot;You know what? People</br>   don't like my hair? Well, they're not going to like my piercings. They are</br>   not going to like my ears. They are not going to like my tattoos and</br>   everything.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you like that you have them now? Is it something you're proud</br>   of?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Are there days where you're like, &quot;Eh?”</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, yeah, I do like them. For example, it has been difficult to</br>   find a job because of it, because of people that are like, &quot;You don't look</br>   professional. I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.&quot; I work here in</br>   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.</br>   She was like, &quot;You need to cover your ears.&quot; She didn't even allow me to</br>   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She was like, &quot;No. You are keeping your hair down, because you</br>   cannot show your ears.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And the same thing for my</br>   tattoos too. She was like, &quot;You need to cover them up because they're not</br>   professional.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's like 40 degrees outside. It's really hot</br>   in here,&quot; especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it</br>   gets so hot in there. I was like, &quot;You see, I'm not even trying to fight</br>   with you anymore. I'm going to die of a heat stroke if you don't allow me</br>   to take my jacket off.&quot; But she was very rude about that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, were you a teacher then for her, or what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I was a teacher in her school.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, cool. Are you currently?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you're not? No.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. It was way too much. She even made me cry about it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm looking for a job right now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm curious. I'm looking at your tattoos. They're really beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you mind telling me a bit about them or when you got them?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay. This one was the first one. To be honest with you—I don't</br>   regret the piercings, and I don't regret the tattoos that much—I do wish</br>   that I had taken better of them, because I scratched them, and I did lots</br>   of things that you're not supposed to do with tattoos. So, the ink just</br>   blowed up. Yeah, I got this for a very important person of mine. She's my</br>   ... What do you call it? Step-sister? She's the daughter of my father, but</br>   she's not the daughter of my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Step-sister works or half-sister, that thing.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. She's still in the United States. She's trying to get here. I</br>   met her two years ago. Her name is Rosalind. She did help me out a lot of</br>   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on</br>   me. So, I was like, &quot;Yep, I'm going to get a rose,&quot; because I have a great</br>   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.&quot; Then I got this for</br>   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up</br>   because I really hate it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh really?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's very poorly done. This is my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They just changed the eye color because he didn't listen to me. I</br>   gave him the photo, and he was like, &quot;You know what? We should put her with</br>   yellow eyes. That will really bring out the color.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I</br>   think we should stick to the colors on the picture.&quot; But he didn't listen</br>   to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, you're going to have to change that. That's interesting</br>   that he didn't listen to you.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my</br>   father, he has Lupita written out on his arm in this gaudy Cholo letters.</br>   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,</br>   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have</br>   asked him, &quot;Have you ever been to prison?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Where do you got those tattoos?&quot; &quot;In the studio.&quot; They don't look like</br>   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, &quot;When I'm</br>   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something</br>   related to you.&quot; She was like, &quot;No, don't do that.&quot; She doesn't like</br>   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really</br>   upset about it. She was like, &quot;Why did you did that?&quot; So, it was like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;I don't want to get the heart shape.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With the mom?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: With the mom. I think I'm going to have a very imagination, so I</br>   was like, &quot;I am going to get a portrait of her, but not a realistic one</br>   because they feel horrible. They don't last anything.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, I'm going to get it in a traditional way,&quot; and that's what I go.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, did you do that art, or did you just have the designer do it?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I told him what I wanted. I gave him a photo for reference, and I</br>   said, &quot;Just don't make it realistic, and make it on a more traditional</br>   tattoo type.&quot; She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then I got a couple on my legs and on</br>   my feet.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, no, those are really beautiful. Then just some further</br>   in-depth questions, just to kind of zoom out, you're welcome to bring your</br>   own experience into it, but I was just wondering if you have any opinions</br>   kind of how the Mexican government and then how the US government is</br>   handling migration. Is there anything that you would like them to know in</br>   terms of humanizing migrants or how people, even young people in school,</br>   should treat or perceive people from different countries or from Mexico</br>   specifically?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a huge question. Answer it however you want.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't think that they're even trying to handle it anymore. I</br>   think it's just something that they ignore. All of the things that I have</br>   been reading is like, “Yeah, there's migrants in the border, and the</br>   government is trying to set them apart.” I was like, “Besides that, what</br>   else are we doing?” I don't see a strong answer for that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. No, I think that's kind of how I feel too. There seems to be</br>   kind of an idea like, &quot;Oh, you're neither from here nor there,&quot; kind of the</br>   conversation with your cousins. You're either too American to be Mexican or</br>   too Mexican to be American. How do you respond, or what do you think about</br>   kind of that mentality?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Discrimination/stigmatization, Profiling, Xenophobia, Racism">Zayuri: It's annoying definitely because it downgrades you. It's like   you're not enough for anyone apparently. Especially in my family, they   treat you like—they don't even want to listen to it. For example, my   grandma, the one that is here, she's so annoyed by the whole thing. She   thinks that all the family that went to the United States and came back ...   She's like, &quot;Ugh, now they think that they have seen the whole world, and   now they think that they're better than us.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. So, I can't   even talk to you about this, right?&quot; And don't even try to mention that you   miss something about the United States, because she's going to be like,   &quot;Well, go right there. Go back. What are you doing in here?&quot; I was like,   &quot;Yeah, that's the same thing that I question.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Tattoos, Meaning">Zayuri: With the mom. I think I'm going to have a very imagination, so I   was like, &quot;I am going to get a portrait of her, but not a realistic one   because they feel horrible. They don't last anything.&quot; So, I was like,   &quot;Yeah, I'm going to get it in a traditional way,&quot; and that's what I go.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Tattoos, Meaning, Family">Zayuri: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my   father, he has Lupita written out on his arm in this gaudy Cholo letters.   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have   asked him, &quot;Have you ever been to prison?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No.&quot; I was like,   &quot;Where do you got those tattoos?&quot; &quot;In the studio.&quot; They don't look like   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.     Zayuri: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, &quot;When I'm   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something   related to you.&quot; She was like, &quot;No, don't do that.&quot; She doesn't like   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really   upset about it. She was like, &quot;Why did you did that?&quot; So, it was like,   &quot;Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.&quot; I was like,   &quot;I don't want to get the heart shape.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Tattoos, Meaning">Zayuri: They just changed the eye color because he didn't listen to me. I   gave him the photo, and he was like, &quot;You know what? We should put her with   yellow eyes. That will really bring out the color.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I   think we should stick to the colors on the picture.&quot; But he didn't listen   to me.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Tattoos, Meaning">Zayuri: Yeah. She's still in the United States. She's trying to get here. I   met her two years ago. Her name is Rosalind. She did help me out a lot of   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on   me. So, I was like, &quot;Yep, I'm going to get a rose,&quot; because I have a great   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.&quot; Then I got this for   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up   because I really hate it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Tattoos, Meaning">Zayuri: Okay. This one was the first one. To be honest with you—I don't   regret the piercings, and I don't regret the tattoos that much—I do wish   that I had taken better of them, because I scratched them, and I did lots   of things that you're not supposed to do with tattoos. So, the ink just   blowed up. Yeah, I got this for a very important person of mine. She's my   ... What do you call it? Step-sister? She's the daughter of my father, but   she's not the daughter of my mom.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs/employment/work, Discrimination">Zayuri: She was like, &quot;No. You are keeping your hair down, because you   cannot show your ears.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And the same thing for my   tattoos too. She was like, &quot;You need to cover them up because they're not   professional.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's like 40 degrees outside. It's really hot   in here,&quot; especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it   gets so hot in there. I was like, &quot;You see, I'm not even trying to fight   with you anymore. I'm going to die of a heat stroke if you don't allow me   to take my jacket off.&quot; But she was very rude about that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs/employment/work, Discrimination, Time in the US, Tattoos">Zayuri: No, yeah, I do like them. For example, it has been difficult to   find a job because of it, because of people that are like, &quot;You don't look   professional. I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.&quot; I work here in   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.   She was like, &quot;You need to cover your ears.&quot; She didn't even allow me to   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.     Isabel: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Tattoos">Zayuri: Then it went downhill crazy, and I was like, &quot;You know what? People   don't like my hair? Well, they're not going to like my piercings. They are   not going to like my ears. They are not going to like my tattoos and   everything.&quot; Yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family">Zayuri: I try to, but we see it from very different perspectives. For   example, I took it in a very aesthetic way. That's why I stretch my ears,   and I've got a couple of my piercings. And I have told my mom this, “This   is what was beautiful to us. This is what beauty was to us before all the   colonizing that we had. This is what meant beautiful for us.” She's like,   &quot;Yeah, that's too much.” She will wear the traditional clothes, but she   will look at my body modifications, and she will be like, &quot;Yeah, that's a   little bit too much. Yeah, we get it, but that's it.&quot; Yeah, she doesn't   like them.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Cultural differences">Zayuri: For example, I try to see more things in Spanish, and I try to be   more connected to the culture and everything. Even in the United States, we   celebrated all the days. We put up an altar on Dia de los Muertos [All   Souls Day] and everything. My father was like, &quot;This is who we are, and   this is what we're going to say.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Discrimination/stigmatization">Zayuri: That's a hard one. It's quite hard because if you ask people,   they're not even going to... I have asked my cousin, &quot;What do you think of   me? Do you think I sound more American or you think I sound more Mexican?   What do you think?&quot; They were like, &quot;I don't know. You just sound weird.&quot; I   was like, &quot;That's another point to my self-esteem. Thank you.&quot; Oh god, that   is hard. I'll say I'm more Mexican, I guess.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Cultural differences">Zayuri: Yeah. The memes that are funny in Spanish is so hard to translate   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks English and Spanish,   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a 30   minute rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. “You   get it?” “No.” I try. That's it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Lost opportunities, Immigration status">Zayuri: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, &quot;Okay, I'm   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and   then try to get there,&quot; because it was a struggle even to pay the college   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the   college in the United States. I was thinking of that, just finishing   college in here and trying to go legally back there.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Mental Health, Crime and Violence, Cultural differences">Zayuri: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, &quot;Why is this place   like this?” [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get   used to like, &quot;Oh, you can’t go to play basketball at 10:00 PM because   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.&quot;   So, I was like, &quot;Okay. Now what? What do we do?&quot; You just stay in the   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, DACA, Fear">Zayuri: Anita. She mentioned the DREAMers program. I think I brought it up   once with my dad, but he was like, &quot;No. We have to keep things private.” He   was just private, and he didn't even want to try to get the papers for us.   He said that, &quot;No, we're just going to get a spotlight on us, and that is   going to be dangerous,&quot; and all of that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, DACA, Fear">sabel: Yeah, absolutely. So, looking back on it, you said you felt like   you were being punished. Did you know of the DACA program? Was that   available yet or anything like that?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Zayuri: She told me that she wanted to keep us safe, and that was the   reason. But nowadays she's trying to reconnect with her family and   everything, but it's still quite hard because the family that did stay   here, they're like, &quot;Oh, you guys are so agringados. You think you're   better than us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, really.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Discrimination, Profiling">Zayuri: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an   indigenous woman. My father, he could white pass very easily, but my mom,   no. She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I   live here and I say that, &quot;Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,&quot; she's like,   &quot;Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another   language?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; She didn't really like to mention it.   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Zayuri: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an   indigenous woman.

My father always told me that we had to be very   discreet, keep things private. “If they ask you, you were born here. Don't   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.” He almost made it   look like, &quot;Don't say you're Mexican. Just say you're really tan.&quot; That's   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,   &quot;Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,   but I'll try.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Border crossing, General">Isabel: Sorry, I should have asked this earlier, but did you then cross the   border together?     Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Reasons for Exit, Voluntary Departure">Zayuri: Yeah. A friend of mine got deported, and my father got scared of   it—I was about to turn 18, I was like one step away from my birthday. He   said, &quot;I think it's about time for you to go to Mexico.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?   Why me? What did I make this time? I've been a good kid.&quot; I saw it as a   punishment. I was like, &quot;Why did I did wrong? Why do you think that I have   to leave?&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Bullying">Zayuri: [Laughs]. I was like, &quot;Why does that upset you that much? We're not   even talking about you, Cynthia. Why do you take it personal?&quot; [Emphasis].   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.   &quot;She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.&quot; I   was like, &quot;We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?&quot;   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have   confronted her and be like, &quot;What is your problem with me? Can we make   something about it?&quot; but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired   of it. She didn't.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Friends">Zayuri: Not that many. I have never made that many friends. And most of my   friends were people I will say that related to me—in a sense that they were   also Latin or Black. We didn't get that many white friends. [Laughs]. Yeah.   Not really.    </span> Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Discrimination/stigmatization">Zayuri: They were not used to us. For example, I remember a girl that she   got really angry when she find out that I was speaking Spanish with another   girl. She was like really annoyed by that, and I was like, &quot;Why do—&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Discrimination/stigmatization">Zayuri: Yeah, that was my chance to make a friend. I'm really shy. It   really causes me to not talk to people. It's really hard for me to do that.   I still have nightmares with that. I was like, &quot;I could have made a good   friend, and I just let it pass.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Discrimination">ayuri: No, I said it in Spanish. She was like, &quot;Okay,&quot; and she sat next to   me. She had this beautiful skirt, and I just said, &quot;Oh, your skirt is so   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In Ireland,&quot; or something   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from Ireland?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from   Germany.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons   from Duolingo? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.&quot; I was   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.&quot; I was like,   &quot;Okay.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.&quot; By   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Zayuri: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;   She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Pastimes, Working">Zayuri: I could literally go right now. I have my backpack with me. Yeah,   because being with them will mean a chill afternoon.

You just hit me up if you need more.&quot; And 10   minutes later, &quot;Are you sure that you don't need me today?&quot; [Loud voice].   Because my brothers, they're not annoying, but they're very loud,   especially when they're together. So, I was like, &quot;Yeah, I need to get away   from here.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work, Occupations">Zayuri: There was a girl.

I'm the first one born, 20 years old</br>   now, and the next one is 17, and the youngest one, he's 10. So, they're</br>   significantly younger than me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Are you just more mellow, like you like things to be calm,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. I don't tolerate noise that much. It really sets me up in a</br>   very mad mood.

It was fun.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you like the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, I really like kids.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I love hanging out with kids too. You kind of get a break from all</br>   the dynamics of the older people.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, all the adulting and stuff. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's just not nice, right?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No. I just want to make a pillow fort. Leave me alone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. It's just better for me, for my mental health in general</br>   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I</br>   get headaches and stuff. I was like, &quot;Yep, got to get out of here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm the same way.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they</br>   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I</br>   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because</br>   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't</br>   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and</br>   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are</br>   here in Mexico, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's</br>   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes</br>   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, &quot;Why do they</br>   have that and I didn't?&quot; I'm really happy for them. I understand that they</br>   are just getting better.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. I'm sure it's kind of difficult sometimes of you also wanted</br>   those opportunities.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about what you did like to do in the US, even</br>   though you didn't have those opportunities? Do you have any other passions?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: What I didn't like to do?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,</br>   anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and</br>   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and</br>   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a</br>   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh</br>   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do</br>   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just</br>   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now</br>   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to</br>   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me</br>   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One</br>   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't</br>   remember how I figured out that she was German.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses</br>   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a</br>   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge</br>   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you</br>   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting</br>   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the</br>   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say it in German?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I said it in Spanish. She was like, &quot;Okay,&quot; and she sat next to</br>   me. She had this beautiful skirt, and I just said, &quot;Oh, your skirt is so</br>   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In Ireland,&quot; or something</br>   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from Ireland?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from</br>   Germany.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons</br>   from Duolingo? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.&quot; By</br>   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No!</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, that was my chance to make a friend. I'm really shy. It</br>   really causes me to not talk to people. It's really hard for me to do that.</br>   I still have nightmares with that. I was like, &quot;I could have made a good</br>   friend, and I just let it pass.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you've got to seize those moments. But that's kind of what's</br>   cool about knowing different languages is you can connect with different</br>   people, so that's awesome. You mentioned you were kind of shy. Were you</br>   also shy when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends? Did you make friends or more of a loner?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Not that many. I have never made that many friends. And most of my</br>   friends were people I will say that related to me—in a sense that they were</br>   also Latin or Black. We didn't get that many white friends. [Laughs]. Yeah.</br>   Not really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They were not used to us. For example, I remember a girl that she</br>   got really angry when she find out that I was speaking Spanish with another</br>   girl. She was like really annoyed by that, and I was like, &quot;Why do—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Just for the audio, that was a perfectly executed stank eye that</br>   you can't pick up.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Laughs]. I was like, &quot;Why does that upset you that much? We're not</br>   even talking about you, Cynthia. Why do you take it personal?&quot; [Emphasis].</br>   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the</br>   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.</br>   &quot;She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?&quot;</br>   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about</br>   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be</br>   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have</br>   confronted her and be like, &quot;What is your problem with me? Can we make</br>   something about it?&quot; but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired</br>   of it. She didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about just what led to returning to Mexico?</br>   Was it a family decision, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. A friend of mine got deported, and my father got scared of</br>   it—I was about to turn 18, I was like one step away from my birthday. He</br>   said, &quot;I think it's about time for you to go to Mexico.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?</br>   Why me? What did I make this time? I've been a good kid.&quot; I saw it as a</br>   punishment. I was like, &quot;Why did I did wrong? Why do you think that I have</br>   to leave?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was your entire family undocumented at this point?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Sorry, I should have asked this earlier, but did you then cross the</br>   border together?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So, then you were living without the papers and everything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you know that when you went at 12 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I didn't. My father always told me that we had to be very</br>   discreet, keep things private. “If they ask you, you were born here. Don't</br>   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.” He almost made it</br>   look like, &quot;Don't say you're Mexican. Just say you're really tan.&quot; That's</br>   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,</br>   but I'll try.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did that make you really anxious or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an</br>   indigenous woman. My father, he could white pass very easily, but my mom,</br>   no. She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I</br>   live here and I say that, &quot;Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,&quot; she's like,</br>   &quot;Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another</br>   language?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; She didn't really like to mention it.</br>   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that's—</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She told me that she wanted to keep us safe, and that was the</br>   reason. But nowadays she's trying to reconnect with her family and</br>   everything, but it's still quite hard because the family that did stay</br>   here, they're like, &quot;Oh, you guys are so agringados. You think you're</br>   better than us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, really.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when</br>   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,</br>   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you</br>   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to</br>   turn 18. You go to Mexico.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he</br>   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I</br>   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.</br>   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to</br>   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay</br>   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,</br>   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with</br>   them.&quot; So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last</br>   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I</br>   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I</br>   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and</br>   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in</br>   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. So, looking back on it, you said you felt like</br>   you were being punished. Did you know of the DACA program? Was that</br>   available yet or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. When they mentioned… Isabel, was that her name?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Anita. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Anita. She mentioned the DREAMers program. I think I brought it up</br>   once with my dad, but he was like, &quot;No. We have to keep things private.” He</br>   was just private, and he didn't even want to try to get the papers for us.</br>   He said that, &quot;No, we're just going to get a spotlight on us, and that is</br>   going to be dangerous,&quot; and all of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, kind of just sounds like so worried about kind of being</br>   deported or being detected that there wasn't really any opportunities that</br>   you were able to take.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, when you returned to Mexico and you had to adjust to even just</br>   the air quality and everything, did you feel like, &quot;Okay, well I'm</br>   returning to a country I know,&quot; or did you feel like it's been so much time</br>   in the US that this was just completely new to you?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was</br>   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, &quot;Why is this place</br>   like this?” [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my</br>   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I</br>   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get</br>   used to like, &quot;Oh, you can’t go to play basketball at 10:00 PM because</br>   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.&quot;</br>   So, I was like, &quot;Okay. Now what? What do we do?&quot; You just stay in the</br>   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of</br>   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such</br>   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of</br>   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say</br>   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a</br>   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four</br>   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my</br>   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a</br>   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the</br>   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I</br>   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that</br>   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned</br>   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn</br>   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I</br>   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay</br>   that much attention to that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It</br>   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple</br>   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing</br>   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this</br>   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the same day?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw</br>   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even</br>   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,</br>   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't</br>   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was</br>   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do</br>   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both</br>   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,</br>   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure</br>   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do</br>   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right</br>   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was</br>   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my</br>   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,</br>   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were</br>   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police</br>   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't</br>   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,</br>   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if</br>   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press</br>   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that</br>   is my nice phone.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You bought with your own money.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to</br>   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You</br>   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about</br>   it in the morning.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying</br>   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know</br>   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the</br>   beginning.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Kind of zooming out a big, larger reflection question, if you</br>   were in the US, what do you think you'd be doing, or what would you like to</br>   be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: College. Probably going to college. I was just studying chemistry</br>   here in Mexico, but I didn't really even like it that much, and then I was</br>   thinking about something related to environmental science.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That'd be really cool. Would you think more ocean, or would</br>   you go more forest? Does it really matter?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Maybe ocean. Probably ocean.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. There's some really cool stuff. Since you're now in Mexico,</br>   what do you think you hope to do? Do you hope to return to the U.S.? Do you</br>   want to continue your studies here? What do you see for yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, &quot;Okay, I'm</br>   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and</br>   then try to get there,&quot; because it was a struggle even to pay the college</br>   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the</br>   college in the United States. I was thinking of that, just finishing</br>   college in here and trying to go legally back there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why do you want to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I think it will be better. I think I will find a better job. It</br>   seems more realistic to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you connect more with people in the U.S. or in</br>   Mexico, or is it just different?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's different definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. The memes that are funny in Spanish is so hard to translate</br>   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks English and Spanish,</br>   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She</br>   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm</br>   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German</br>   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see</br>   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a 30</br>   minute rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. “You</br>   get it?” “No.” I try. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American, the United</br>   States American, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: That's a hard one. It's quite hard because if you ask people,</br>   they're not even going to... I have asked my cousin, &quot;What do you think of</br>   me? Do you think I sound more American or you think I sound more Mexican?</br>   What do you think?&quot; They were like, &quot;I don't know. You just sound weird.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;That's another point to my self-esteem. Thank you.&quot; Oh god, that</br>   is hard. I'll say I'm more Mexican, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: For example, I try to see more things in Spanish, and I try to be</br>   more connected to the culture and everything. Even in the United States, we</br>   celebrated all the days. We put up an altar on Dia de los Muertos [All</br>   Souls Day] and everything. My father was like, &quot;This is who we are, and</br>   this is what we're going to say.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You said your mom is starting to kind of reconnect with her own</br>   heritage. Do you feel connected with that at all, or have you tried to, or</br>   is that mostly your mother?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I try to, but we see it from very different perspectives. For</br>   example, I took it in a very aesthetic way. That's why I stretch my ears,</br>   and I've got a couple of my piercings. And I have told my mom this, “This</br>   is what was beautiful to us. This is what beauty was to us before all the</br>   colonizing that we had. This is what meant beautiful for us.” She's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's too much.” She will wear the traditional clothes, but she</br>   will look at my body modifications, and she will be like, &quot;Yeah, that's a</br>   little bit too much. Yeah, we get it, but that's it.&quot; Yeah, she doesn't</br>   like them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: When did you decide to get into kind of piercings, or you stretched</br>   your ear, kind of like connect with that part? Do you mind going into that</br>   a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was 16. I was 16, and I remember a guy in my class. He made a</br>   commentary. I think it was about another girl that had been growing her</br>   natural hair, and he was like, &quot;I don't think that that's even hygienic.&quot;</br>   And I was like—because by that time, I was wearing dreads—&quot;What do you mean</br>   by that?&quot; He was like, &quot;I don't know. They just look dirty.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br>   have been closer to her, and I have been close to you, and I think she</br>   smells nicer than you. So, what's the deal with that?&quot; He couldn't even</br>   explain why he thought that that was dirty or that was unhygienic. I was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Now, I remember I told my mom—because she used to braid my</br>   hair—&quot;Why you don't do it anymore?&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you just don't sit</br>   still.&quot; I was like, &quot;I can sit still, but why don't you do it anymore?&quot; She</br>   was trying to make these excuses: “I don't have time for it, and I don't</br>   like it.” Then she said, &quot;I don't think that you're going to look</br>   professional,&quot; and that was what stuck to me because I was just struggling</br>   to get a job by that time. I was like, &quot;What do you mean professionally?&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;People here don't get it. You're not going to look right for</br>   them.&quot; I was like, &quot;What is right?” Because right now it's all dead, but it</br>   can be very curly. I was like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Because she was</br>   constantly pressuring me to get a perm or to constantly straighten it up. I</br>   was like, &quot;You know that that's even damaging for me. I don't even like to</br>   do it. I understand if other people enjoy it, but I don't.&quot; She was like,</br>   &quot;It's just what's better for you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then it went downhill crazy, and I was like, &quot;You know what? People</br>   don't like my hair? Well, they're not going to like my piercings. They are</br>   not going to like my ears. They are not going to like my tattoos and</br>   everything.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you like that you have them now? Is it something you're proud</br>   of?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Are there days where you're like, &quot;Eh?”</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, yeah, I do like them. For example, it has been difficult to</br>   find a job because of it, because of people that are like, &quot;You don't look</br>   professional. I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.&quot; I work here in</br>   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.</br>   She was like, &quot;You need to cover your ears.&quot; She didn't even allow me to</br>   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She was like, &quot;No. You are keeping your hair down, because you</br>   cannot show your ears.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And the same thing for my</br>   tattoos too. She was like, &quot;You need to cover them up because they're not</br>   professional.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's like 40 degrees outside. It's really hot</br>   in here,&quot; especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it</br>   gets so hot in there. I was like, &quot;You see, I'm not even trying to fight</br>   with you anymore. I'm going to die of a heat stroke if you don't allow me</br>   to take my jacket off.&quot; But she was very rude about that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, were you a teacher then for her, or what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I was a teacher in her school.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, cool. Are you currently?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you're not? No.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. It was way too much. She even made me cry about it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm looking for a job right now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm curious. I'm looking at your tattoos. They're really beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you mind telling me a bit about them or when you got them?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay. This one was the first one. To be honest with you—I don't</br>   regret the piercings, and I don't regret the tattoos that much—I do wish</br>   that I had taken better of them, because I scratched them, and I did lots</br>   of things that you're not supposed to do with tattoos. So, the ink just</br>   blowed up. Yeah, I got this for a very important person of mine. She's my</br>   ... What do you call it? Step-sister? She's the daughter of my father, but</br>   she's not the daughter of my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Step-sister works or half-sister, that thing.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. She's still in the United States. She's trying to get here. I</br>   met her two years ago. Her name is Rosalind. She did help me out a lot of</br>   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on</br>   me. So, I was like, &quot;Yep, I'm going to get a rose,&quot; because I have a great</br>   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.&quot; Then I got this for</br>   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up</br>   because I really hate it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh really?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's very poorly done. This is my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They just changed the eye color because he didn't listen to me. I</br>   gave him the photo, and he was like, &quot;You know what? We should put her with</br>   yellow eyes. That will really bring out the color.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I</br>   think we should stick to the colors on the picture.&quot; But he didn't listen</br>   to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, you're going to have to change that. That's interesting</br>   that he didn't listen to you.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my</br>   father, he has Lupita written out on his arm in this gaudy Cholo letters.</br>   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,</br>   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have</br>   asked him, &quot;Have you ever been to prison?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Where do you got those tattoos?&quot; &quot;In the studio.&quot; They don't look like</br>   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, &quot;When I'm</br>   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something</br>   related to you.&quot; She was like, &quot;No, don't do that.&quot; She doesn't like</br>   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really</br>   upset about it. She was like, &quot;Why did you did that?&quot; So, it was like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;I don't want to get the heart shape.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With the mom?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: With the mom. I think I'm going to have a very imagination, so I</br>   was like, &quot;I am going to get a portrait of her, but not a realistic one</br>   because they feel horrible. They don't last anything.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, I'm going to get it in a traditional way,&quot; and that's what I go.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, did you do that art, or did you just have the designer do it?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I told him what I wanted. I gave him a photo for reference, and I</br>   said, &quot;Just don't make it realistic, and make it on a more traditional</br>   tattoo type.&quot; She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then I got a couple on my legs and on</br>   my feet.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, no, those are really beautiful. Then just some further</br>   in-depth questions, just to kind of zoom out, you're welcome to bring your</br>   own experience into it, but I was just wondering if you have any opinions</br>   kind of how the Mexican government and then how the US government is</br>   handling migration. Is there anything that you would like them to know in</br>   terms of humanizing migrants or how people, even young people in school,</br>   should treat or perceive people from different countries or from Mexico</br>   specifically?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a huge question. Answer it however you want.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't think that they're even trying to handle it anymore. I</br>   think it's just something that they ignore. All of the things that I have</br>   been reading is like, “Yeah, there's migrants in the border, and the</br>   government is trying to set them apart.” I was like, “Besides that, what</br>   else are we doing?” I don't see a strong answer for that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. No, I think that's kind of how I feel too. There seems to be</br>   kind of an idea like, &quot;Oh, you're neither from here nor there,&quot; kind of the</br>   conversation with your cousins. You're either too American to be Mexican or</br>   too Mexican to be American. How do you respond, or what do you think about</br>   kind of that mentality?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's annoying definitely because it downgrades you. It's like</br>   you're not enough for anyone apparently. Especially in my family, they</br>   treat you like—they don't even want to listen to it. For example, my</br>   grandma, the one that is here, she's so annoyed by the whole thing. She</br>   thinks that all the family that went to the United States and came back ...</br>   She's like, &quot;Ugh, now they think that they have seen the whole world, and</br>   now they think that they're better than us.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. So, I can't</br>   even talk to you about this, right?&quot; And don't even try to mention that you</br>   miss something about the United States, because she's going to be like,</br>   &quot;Well, go right there. Go back. What are you doing in here?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's the same thing that I question.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, yeah. Probably asking yourself that too.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Friendship,  difficulty, Sadness, Mixed-status, The United States">Isabel: Well, if there's anything else you'd like to add, or you want   people to know before we wrap up?     Zayuri: What else? I mean, it's hard, really hard trying to leave   everything. For example, my dad, I remember that he told us, &quot;Don't even   get too attached to your friends because you don't know if tomorrow we're   still going to be here.&quot; So, it was like, “That's nice advice for my first   day to school. Thank you. I'll make the best that I can with that.” So, I   remember, that even talking to people for me was like, “What's the point?   Am I going to see you next week? Probably not.”?     Isabel: Not allowing yourself to get attached.     Zayuri: To anyone, even on a friendship level. I was like, &quot;What's the   point?&quot; For example, I could never had friends over because my dad didn't   even like us to share the address. Because we were living on part that was   full of other migrants, so he was like, &quot;No, there's no gringos coming out   to this area. You don't know how they're going to react. If something   happens to them, and they're in the whole right to do it, but they try to   call the police, you don't know what kind of problems we can get into.&quot;   That was like, &quot;Okay. So, no friends over. Can I go to other friends?&quot; &quot;No.   No, no, no, no, no.&quot; So, you'd have to have McDonald's and go back here   before sunset. All right. And that was the way to go. [Interview ends   00:40:</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Interactions with police, Profiling, Mistrust, Mexico">Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.     Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay   that much attention to that.     Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—     Isabel: In the same day?     Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?     Isabel: Pat down or legally search?     Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,   &quot;Okay.&quot;     Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that   is my nice phone.”     Isabel: You bought with your own money.     Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about   it in the morning.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the   beginning.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="College,  student loans, The United States,  misperceptions, College, The United States, Return to Mexico, Disappointment, Opportunity,  depression">Isabel: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.     Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to   turn 18. You go to Mexico.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.     Isabel: No, I know.     Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with   them.&quot; So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.     Isabel: What was difficult?     Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Hobbies, Language">Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,   anything like that.     Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].     Isabel: Of what?     Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.     Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.     Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't   remember how I figured out that she was German.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mental Health, Education">Zayuri: Yeah. It's just better for me, for my mental health in general   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I   get headaches and stuff. I was like, &quot;Yep, got to get out of here.&quot;     Isabel: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.     Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].     Isabel: I'm the same way.     Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are   here in Mexico, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, &quot;Why do they   have that and I didn't?&quot; I'm really happy for them. I understand that they   are just getting better.    </span> Isabel: Yeah. I'm sure it's kind of difficult sometimes of you also wanted</br>   those opportunities.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about what you did like to do in the US, even</br>   though you didn't have those opportunities? Do you have any other passions?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: What I didn't like to do?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,</br>   anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and</br>   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and</br>   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a</br>   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh</br>   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do</br>   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just</br>   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now</br>   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to</br>   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me</br>   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One</br>   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't</br>   remember how I figured out that she was German.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses</br>   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a</br>   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge</br>   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you</br>   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting</br>   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the</br>   driver was angry, so I will say to you, &quot;You need to get out of the line.&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say it in German?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I said it in Spanish. She was like, &quot;Okay,&quot; and she sat next to</br>   me. She had this beautiful skirt, and I just said, &quot;Oh, your skirt is so</br>   nice. Where did you bought it?&quot; She was like, &quot;In Ireland,&quot; or something</br>   like that. I said, &quot;Oh, are you from Ireland?&quot; She was like, &quot;No, I'm from</br>   Germany.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons</br>   from Duolingo? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.&quot; By</br>   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No!</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, that was my chance to make a friend. I'm really shy. It</br>   really causes me to not talk to people. It's really hard for me to do that.</br>   I still have nightmares with that. I was like, &quot;I could have made a good</br>   friend, and I just let it pass.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you've got to seize those moments. But that's kind of what's</br>   cool about knowing different languages is you can connect with different</br>   people, so that's awesome. You mentioned you were kind of shy. Were you</br>   also shy when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends? Did you make friends or more of a loner?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Not that many. I have never made that many friends. And most of my</br>   friends were people I will say that related to me—in a sense that they were</br>   also Latin or Black. We didn't get that many white friends. [Laughs]. Yeah.</br>   Not really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They were not used to us. For example, I remember a girl that she</br>   got really angry when she find out that I was speaking Spanish with another</br>   girl. She was like really annoyed by that, and I was like, &quot;Why do—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Just for the audio, that was a perfectly executed stank eye that</br>   you can't pick up.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Laughs]. I was like, &quot;Why does that upset you that much? We're not</br>   even talking about you, Cynthia. Why do you take it personal?&quot; [Emphasis].</br>   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the</br>   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.</br>   &quot;She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?&quot;</br>   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about</br>   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be</br>   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have</br>   confronted her and be like, &quot;What is your problem with me? Can we make</br>   something about it?&quot; but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired</br>   of it. She didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about just what led to returning to Mexico?</br>   Was it a family decision, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. A friend of mine got deported, and my father got scared of</br>   it—I was about to turn 18, I was like one step away from my birthday. He</br>   said, &quot;I think it's about time for you to go to Mexico.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?</br>   Why me? What did I make this time? I've been a good kid.&quot; I saw it as a</br>   punishment. I was like, &quot;Why did I did wrong? Why do you think that I have</br>   to leave?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was your entire family undocumented at this point?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Sorry, I should have asked this earlier, but did you then cross the</br>   border together?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So, then you were living without the papers and everything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you know that when you went at 12 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I didn't. My father always told me that we had to be very</br>   discreet, keep things private. “If they ask you, you were born here. Don't</br>   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.” He almost made it</br>   look like, &quot;Don't say you're Mexican. Just say you're really tan.&quot; That's</br>   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,</br>   but I'll try.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did that make you really anxious or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Self-conscious.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was like, &quot;Oh my god.” Especially because my mom, she's an</br>   indigenous woman. My father, he could white pass very easily, but my mom,</br>   no. She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I</br>   live here and I say that, &quot;Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,&quot; she's like,</br>   &quot;Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another</br>   language?&quot; I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; She didn't really like to mention it.</br>   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that's—</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She told me that she wanted to keep us safe, and that was the</br>   reason. But nowadays she's trying to reconnect with her family and</br>   everything, but it's still quite hard because the family that did stay</br>   here, they're like, &quot;Oh, you guys are so agringados. You think you're</br>   better than us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, really.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when</br>   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,</br>   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you</br>   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, &quot;You're about to</br>   turn 18. You go to Mexico.&quot; I was talking about going to college, and he</br>   said, &quot;Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Well, why not?&quot; He was like, &quot;Have you ever heard of a student loans?&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.&quot; But I</br>   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.</br>   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to</br>   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I know.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, &quot;We can't afford to pay</br>   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,</br>   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with</br>   them.&quot; So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last</br>   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I</br>   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I</br>   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and</br>   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in</br>   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. So, looking back on it, you said you felt like</br>   you were being punished. Did you know of the DACA program? Was that</br>   available yet or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. When they mentioned… Isabel, was that her name?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Anita. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Anita. She mentioned the DREAMers program. I think I brought it up</br>   once with my dad, but he was like, &quot;No. We have to keep things private.” He</br>   was just private, and he didn't even want to try to get the papers for us.</br>   He said that, &quot;No, we're just going to get a spotlight on us, and that is</br>   going to be dangerous,&quot; and all of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, kind of just sounds like so worried about kind of being</br>   deported or being detected that there wasn't really any opportunities that</br>   you were able to take.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, when you returned to Mexico and you had to adjust to even just</br>   the air quality and everything, did you feel like, &quot;Okay, well I'm</br>   returning to a country I know,&quot; or did you feel like it's been so much time</br>   in the US that this was just completely new to you?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was</br>   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, &quot;Why is this place</br>   like this?” [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my</br>   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I</br>   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get</br>   used to like, &quot;Oh, you can’t go to play basketball at 10:00 PM because</br>   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.&quot;</br>   So, I was like, &quot;Okay. Now what? What do we do?&quot; You just stay in the</br>   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of</br>   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such</br>   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of</br>   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say</br>   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a</br>   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four</br>   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my</br>   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a</br>   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the</br>   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I</br>   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that</br>   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned</br>   black. I was like, &quot;Okay, this is not good.&quot; It did turn off. It did turn</br>   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I</br>   could just live with just one. That will be okay.&quot; I was trying to not pay</br>   that much attention to that.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It</br>   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple</br>   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, this is okay.&quot; I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing</br>   for the phone. I was like, &quot;Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this</br>   one.&quot; Then I got robbed. They took that phone—</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the same day?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw</br>   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even</br>   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, &quot;Yeah,</br>   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?&quot; And they didn't</br>   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was</br>   trying to scam him. They were like, &quot;Yeah? He took your phone? And why do</br>   you have one right there?&quot; And I was like, &quot;I can prove that they're both</br>   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,</br>   whatever you ask me.&quot; They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, &quot;Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure</br>   that you can do that.&quot; It was like, &quot;No, there's no witnesses. We can't do</br>   anything about it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. I think I'm going to leave right</br>   now.&quot; I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was</br>   on that phone. I was like, &quot;I don't know how am I going to get to my</br>   house,&quot; and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, &quot;Okay,</br>   can you guys take me there?&quot; I said that to the police officers. They were</br>   like, &quot;No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; They were like, &quot;Take a taxi.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Okay.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police</br>   officers, I was like, &quot;Yes! I'm going to get my things again!&quot; I didn't</br>   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,</br>   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if</br>   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press</br>   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that</br>   is my nice phone.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You bought with your own money.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to</br>   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, &quot;What happened? You</br>   look so sad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about</br>   it in the morning.&quot; I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying</br>   with her, and she was like, &quot;What happened?&quot; I was like, “I don’t know</br>   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the</br>   beginning.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Kind of zooming out a big, larger reflection question, if you</br>   were in the US, what do you think you'd be doing, or what would you like to</br>   be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: College. Probably going to college. I was just studying chemistry</br>   here in Mexico, but I didn't really even like it that much, and then I was</br>   thinking about something related to environmental science.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That'd be really cool. Would you think more ocean, or would</br>   you go more forest? Does it really matter?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Maybe ocean. Probably ocean.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. There's some really cool stuff. Since you're now in Mexico,</br>   what do you think you hope to do? Do you hope to return to the U.S.? Do you</br>   want to continue your studies here? What do you see for yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, &quot;Okay, I'm</br>   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and</br>   then try to get there,&quot; because it was a struggle even to pay the college</br>   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the</br>   college in the United States. I was thinking of that, just finishing</br>   college in here and trying to go legally back there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why do you want to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I think it will be better. I think I will find a better job. It</br>   seems more realistic to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you connect more with people in the U.S. or in</br>   Mexico, or is it just different?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's different definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. The memes that are funny in Spanish is so hard to translate</br>   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks English and Spanish,</br>   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She</br>   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm</br>   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German</br>   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, “Okay, you see</br>   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.” Then there's like a 30</br>   minute rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. “You</br>   get it?” “No.” I try. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American, the United</br>   States American, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: That's a hard one. It's quite hard because if you ask people,</br>   they're not even going to... I have asked my cousin, &quot;What do you think of</br>   me? Do you think I sound more American or you think I sound more Mexican?</br>   What do you think?&quot; They were like, &quot;I don't know. You just sound weird.&quot; I</br>   was like, &quot;That's another point to my self-esteem. Thank you.&quot; Oh god, that</br>   is hard. I'll say I'm more Mexican, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: For example, I try to see more things in Spanish, and I try to be</br>   more connected to the culture and everything. Even in the United States, we</br>   celebrated all the days. We put up an altar on Dia de los Muertos [All</br>   Souls Day] and everything. My father was like, &quot;This is who we are, and</br>   this is what we're going to say.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You said your mom is starting to kind of reconnect with her own</br>   heritage. Do you feel connected with that at all, or have you tried to, or</br>   is that mostly your mother?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I try to, but we see it from very different perspectives. For</br>   example, I took it in a very aesthetic way. That's why I stretch my ears,</br>   and I've got a couple of my piercings. And I have told my mom this, “This</br>   is what was beautiful to us. This is what beauty was to us before all the</br>   colonizing that we had. This is what meant beautiful for us.” She's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's too much.” She will wear the traditional clothes, but she</br>   will look at my body modifications, and she will be like, &quot;Yeah, that's a</br>   little bit too much. Yeah, we get it, but that's it.&quot; Yeah, she doesn't</br>   like them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: When did you decide to get into kind of piercings, or you stretched</br>   your ear, kind of like connect with that part? Do you mind going into that</br>   a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I was 16. I was 16, and I remember a guy in my class. He made a</br>   commentary. I think it was about another girl that had been growing her</br>   natural hair, and he was like, &quot;I don't think that that's even hygienic.&quot;</br>   And I was like—because by that time, I was wearing dreads—&quot;What do you mean</br>   by that?&quot; He was like, &quot;I don't know. They just look dirty.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br>   have been closer to her, and I have been close to you, and I think she</br>   smells nicer than you. So, what's the deal with that?&quot; He couldn't even</br>   explain why he thought that that was dirty or that was unhygienic. I was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Now, I remember I told my mom—because she used to braid my</br>   hair—&quot;Why you don't do it anymore?&quot; She was like, &quot;Oh, you just don't sit</br>   still.&quot; I was like, &quot;I can sit still, but why don't you do it anymore?&quot; She</br>   was trying to make these excuses: “I don't have time for it, and I don't</br>   like it.” Then she said, &quot;I don't think that you're going to look</br>   professional,&quot; and that was what stuck to me because I was just struggling</br>   to get a job by that time. I was like, &quot;What do you mean professionally?&quot;</br>   She was like, &quot;People here don't get it. You're not going to look right for</br>   them.&quot; I was like, &quot;What is right?” Because right now it's all dead, but it</br>   can be very curly. I was like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Because she was</br>   constantly pressuring me to get a perm or to constantly straighten it up. I</br>   was like, &quot;You know that that's even damaging for me. I don't even like to</br>   do it. I understand if other people enjoy it, but I don't.&quot; She was like,</br>   &quot;It's just what's better for you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Then it went downhill crazy, and I was like, &quot;You know what? People</br>   don't like my hair? Well, they're not going to like my piercings. They are</br>   not going to like my ears. They are not going to like my tattoos and</br>   everything.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you like that you have them now? Is it something you're proud</br>   of?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Are there days where you're like, &quot;Eh?”</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, yeah, I do like them. For example, it has been difficult to</br>   find a job because of it, because of people that are like, &quot;You don't look</br>   professional. I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.&quot; I work here in</br>   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.</br>   She was like, &quot;You need to cover your ears.&quot; She didn't even allow me to</br>   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: She was like, &quot;No. You are keeping your hair down, because you</br>   cannot show your ears.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And the same thing for my</br>   tattoos too. She was like, &quot;You need to cover them up because they're not</br>   professional.&quot; I was like, &quot;It's like 40 degrees outside. It's really hot</br>   in here,&quot; especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it</br>   gets so hot in there. I was like, &quot;You see, I'm not even trying to fight</br>   with you anymore. I'm going to die of a heat stroke if you don't allow me</br>   to take my jacket off.&quot; But she was very rude about that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, were you a teacher then for her, or what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No, I was a teacher in her school.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, cool. Are you currently?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you're not? No.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: No. It was way too much. She even made me cry about it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I'm looking for a job right now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm curious. I'm looking at your tattoos. They're really beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you mind telling me a bit about them or when you got them?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay. This one was the first one. To be honest with you—I don't</br>   regret the piercings, and I don't regret the tattoos that much—I do wish</br>   that I had taken better of them, because I scratched them, and I did lots</br>   of things that you're not supposed to do with tattoos. So, the ink just</br>   blowed up. Yeah, I got this for a very important person of mine. She's my</br>   ... What do you call it? Step-sister? She's the daughter of my father, but</br>   she's not the daughter of my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Step-sister works or half-sister, that thing.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. She's still in the United States. She's trying to get here. I</br>   met her two years ago. Her name is Rosalind. She did help me out a lot of</br>   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on</br>   me. So, I was like, &quot;Yep, I'm going to get a rose,&quot; because I have a great</br>   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.&quot; Then I got this for</br>   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up</br>   because I really hate it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh really?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's very poorly done. This is my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: They just changed the eye color because he didn't listen to me. I</br>   gave him the photo, and he was like, &quot;You know what? We should put her with</br>   yellow eyes. That will really bring out the color.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I</br>   think we should stick to the colors on the picture.&quot; But he didn't listen</br>   to me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So, you're going to have to change that. That's interesting</br>   that he didn't listen to you.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my</br>   father, he has Lupita written out on his arm in this gaudy Cholo letters.</br>   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,</br>   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have</br>   asked him, &quot;Have you ever been to prison?&quot; And he's like, &quot;No.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Where do you got those tattoos?&quot; &quot;In the studio.&quot; They don't look like</br>   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, &quot;When I'm</br>   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something</br>   related to you.&quot; She was like, &quot;No, don't do that.&quot; She doesn't like</br>   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really</br>   upset about it. She was like, &quot;Why did you did that?&quot; So, it was like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;I don't want to get the heart shape.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With the mom?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: With the mom. I think I'm going to have a very imagination, so I</br>   was like, &quot;I am going to get a portrait of her, but not a realistic one</br>   because they feel horrible. They don't last anything.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, I'm going to get it in a traditional way,&quot; and that's what I go.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, did you do that art, or did you just have the designer do it?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I told him what I wanted. I gave him a photo for reference, and I</br>   said, &quot;Just don't make it realistic, and make it on a more traditional</br>   tattoo type.&quot; She was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then I got a couple on my legs and on</br>   my feet.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, no, those are really beautiful. Then just some further</br>   in-depth questions, just to kind of zoom out, you're welcome to bring your</br>   own experience into it, but I was just wondering if you have any opinions</br>   kind of how the Mexican government and then how the US government is</br>   handling migration. Is there anything that you would like them to know in</br>   terms of humanizing migrants or how people, even young people in school,</br>   should treat or perceive people from different countries or from Mexico</br>   specifically?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a huge question. Answer it however you want.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: I don't think that they're even trying to handle it anymore. I</br>   think it's just something that they ignore. All of the things that I have</br>   been reading is like, “Yeah, there's migrants in the border, and the</br>   government is trying to set them apart.” I was like, “Besides that, what</br>   else are we doing?” I don't see a strong answer for that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. No, I think that's kind of how I feel too. There seems to be</br>   kind of an idea like, &quot;Oh, you're neither from here nor there,&quot; kind of the</br>   conversation with your cousins. You're either too American to be Mexican or</br>   too Mexican to be American. How do you respond, or what do you think about</br>   kind of that mentality?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: It's annoying definitely because it downgrades you. It's like</br>   you're not enough for anyone apparently. Especially in my family, they</br>   treat you like—they don't even want to listen to it. For example, my</br>   grandma, the one that is here, she's so annoyed by the whole thing. She</br>   thinks that all the family that went to the United States and came back ...</br>   She's like, &quot;Ugh, now they think that they have seen the whole world, and</br>   now they think that they're better than us.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. So, I can't</br>   even talk to you about this, right?&quot; And don't even try to mention that you</br>   miss something about the United States, because she's going to be like,</br>   &quot;Well, go right there. Go back. What are you doing in here?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's the same thing that I question.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, yeah. Probably asking yourself that too.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Well, if there's anything else you'd like to add, or you want</br>   people to know before we wrap up?</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: What else? I mean, it's hard, really hard trying to leave</br>   everything. For example, my dad, I remember that he told us, &quot;Don't even</br>   get too attached to your friends because you don't know if tomorrow we're</br>   still going to be here.&quot; So, it was like, “That's nice advice for my first</br>   day to school. Thank you. I'll make the best that I can with that.” So, I</br>   remember, that even talking to people for me was like, “What's the point?</br>   Am I going to see you next week? Probably not.”?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Not allowing yourself to get attached.</br> </br> </br>   Zayuri: To anyone, even on a friendship level. I was like, &quot;What's the</br>   point?&quot; For example, I could never had friends over because my dad didn't</br>   even like us to share the address. Because we were living on part that was</br>   full of other migrants, so he was like, &quot;No, there's no gringos coming out</br>   to this area. You don't know how they're going to react. If something</br>   happens to them, and they're in the whole right to do it, but they try to</br>   call the police, you don't know what kind of problems we can get into.&quot;</br>   That was like, &quot;Okay. So, no friends over. Can I go to other friends?&quot; &quot;No.</br>   No, no, no, no, no.&quot; So, you'd have to have McDonald's and go back here</br>   before sunset. All right. And that was the way to go. [Interview ends</br>   00:40:08].</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
