with the coyote. It was me and my mom— my mom is really light-skinned, and<br>
she looks Caucasian. She put a camera on and I was in the back playing with<br>
some kid with the little cars and stuff, and just drove right across. Got<br>
to a safe house and my dad came and picked us up, and that was i</span>t. That</br>same week, I started going to kindergarten, got enrolled in school. It was</br>easier back then. It was in the 70s. So I started going to pre-kinder. I</br>went to Mayflower Elementary School, all the way up to the fifth grade. I</br>graduated, and went to Clifton Junior High School. And then I went to</br>Monrovia High. But it was a big process. My mom and dad both had to</br>work—going for that American dream. I am the only child, so I found my</br>friends in the streets. So as a young kid, I started hanging out and I did</br>become involved in the gang culture in LA.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: You had said that your dad actually came over legally for work</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And he worked with horses at the racetrack?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Santa Anita Race Track. Hollywood Park. He went back and forth to Del</br>Mar. He was a groomer, he worked for years in the track. Eventually he left</br>that and he started working for ACME Corporation, which later on turned</br>into Stanley Corporation. He retired from there.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: What did he do there?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: He was a machine operator. A little bit more money than track.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And your mom, what'd she do?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: My mom, she's the one who got me the job at Jan-Kens Enameling. She</br>She was in the painting department. I'm not sure, she was a racker in</br>masking. She worked at the same place I did. She's still working there.</br>She's been there since '84. To this day—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: —she's still working there. She has two more years before she</br>retires.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great. You were talking about driving across the border. When</br>you got here to the states, did it seem different to you?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: That I don't remember. Well, it was different, because as a kid I</br>lived in the city, I lived here. And Monrovia, it was a quiet town for me.</br>It was nice, it was a pretty town. Sidewalks and everything was, you know,</br>pavement and stuff. It was nice. Park areas. I liked it, it was a beautiful</br>place. I lived there all my life almost, just one spot.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So you said that you got involved with gangs. How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was about fourteen, fifteen, going to high school.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Why do you think it happened?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I think it was because I didn't have anybody to watch me. My mom had</br>to go to work. She got out of work, like seven. My dad took off to work at</br>two. He didn't get back until nighttime. So, I had this lapse of five hours</br>that I would get off of school at 1:50 and I had a park across the street</br>from my house that a lot of my friends now hang out at. We're hanging out.</br>We started off just hanging out with the skateboards and the bikes. Little</br>by little, it led to other things. So, I started hanging out with the</br>homies.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: We see that a lot, a lot of the deportees that have come back talk</br>about that.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, it kind of pulls you. That's all you see. It was funny, because</br>like I said, you go out there, you see a beautiful town, but you don't know</br>what's there until later. Because out there, everything's nice, compared to</br>out here. It might be gang infested, but in the daytime it looks like</br>Beverly Hills. You come out at night, it looks like Iraq.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So what about school, did you like school?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I loved school. My first years, elementary and junior high, I was in</br>a GATE program, gifted and talented education, I was pretty smart. I did</br>really good. When I started out hanging out with my friends, that's what</br>messed me up later on. And I didn't get in trouble a lot. I mean, I’ve only</br>been to jail three times. Except I did a lot of time for it. But I mean, I</br>wasn't going in and out of jail. I wasn't going to the halls. I've never</br>been to juvenile hall in my life. It wasn't until I was an adult that I</br>started getting in trouble. I mean, I had a little bit of run-ins, but I</br>never did any time. I was pretty good. I was scared of my mom and dad, they</br>whooped me [Chuckles]. So I tried to do good to please them.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: When you started getting with the gangs, what did that mean? What</br>kind of behavior did you guys engage in?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I don't want to defend the gang culture, but, I mean, we weren't</br>messing with innocent people. I mean, it was just a bunch of kids, we hung</br>out. Our rivalry started from high school, from the football games. That's</br>how our rivalry started, with the other schools and stuff. That's how we</br>started having, I guess, problems with other cities and stuff. But I mean,</br>everybody talked to us. People weren't scared of us. I mean, &quot;Hey, how are</br>you doing? What's up?&quot; &quot;Hey, Juan.&quot; They would talk to us. We only had</br>problems with the people we didn't get along with. We weren't out there</br>causing a ruckus. I never was involved in selling drugs. I never got busted</br>for stealing. I never even got busted for shoplifting. I was a good kid. I</br>just, I had that double life. I used to like to go hang out, but I always</br>liked to work.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did you start working as a kid to make money?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. I started working as a kid to dress the way I wanted to dress</br>because my mom would tell me, &quot;No, you can't wear those pants. They're too</br>big.&quot; Or, &quot;You can't wear that shirt.&quot; Or, &quot;No, you can't cut your hair</br>like that.&quot; So for me to get what I wanted to wear, I started working at</br>the swap meet. I used to work with these Chinese dudes selling shoes. I was</br>thirteen, fourteen. I started making my own money selling shoes and stuff.</br>That's how I started buying my clothes.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Because my mom was like, &quot;If you want to dress that way, you better</br>buy your own clothes.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did they know that you were involved in these gangs?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I think they might've suspected it, but they didn't want to believe</br>it until later, until they finally knew it, until I was deep in it. Because</br>they would see that I had little tattoos and stuff, but they wouldn't ... I</br>mean, they would see my friends as the kids I grew up with. They didn't see</br>them as gang members. They knew them as so-and-so's son, and so-and-so's</br>daughter. I mean, your mom's always going to think you're an angel no</br>matter what you do.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Does she still?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, still to this day. I love my mom, I love my dad. They're good.</br>They're good people.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So they were working really hard and you were just trying to make</br>your way?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So you got married at some point?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And you got in trouble at some point?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Which happened first?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I got in trouble first. Like I said, I had already gotten my papers</br>in '88.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Talk a little bit about that, about the papers, because that's</br>interesting.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Okay. Well, since we were illegal, so we were scared because they</br>were doing round-ups—I don't know what they call it when they start</br>deporting everybody and the buses come. I don't what they call</br>them…redadas. I don't know how they say it in English.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Raids?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Raids, yeah. They're doing raids. INS [Immigration and Naturalization</br>Service] raids and stuff at certain places. And we were scared it would</br>happen at school and stuff. My dad, he was all right, but me and my mom</br>were like, &quot;No, we need to fix our papers.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Was he still on a working visa or not?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No, he had already gotten his permanent residency.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, okay.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: So he's the one who helped us get our permanent residency through the</br>Amnesty Program. So, I guess if you had been there longer than ten years,</br>in the States, and had been working and stuff, you had to just prove with</br>the papers that you were working, you were paying your taxes and stuff. So</br>they gave us our green cards, my green card.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: The only thing is I didn't appreciate it, because I get it in '88 and</br>then 1990, I get busted for a joyride.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: A joyride?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Joyride, yeah. Get busted joyriding—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So, you stole a car?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: We stole a car, me and my buddy. The keys were in there, we took off.</br>We got in trouble. I did six months for that. But I never got deported. I</br>just showed them my green card, I got out.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: How old were you at that point?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was eighteen. I was eighteen-years-old. That was the first time I</br>ever got busted, eighteen years old, joyriding. Gave me six months. I got</br>out—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: You were eighteen, so it wasn't juvenile?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No. I went to LA County. I did my time in county jail. I didn't go to</br>prison. Then in 1992, that's when I got busted. That's the first time I</br>went to the pen. I got into an altercation at a party and there were some</br>shots fired, and I got busted. I mean, I didn't do it, but you can't tell</br>how it goes. So, I got busted with the guys that were there too, and we all</br>had to do time. I did three-and-a-half years off of that. They gave me</br>seven years, I did three and a half. Then—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: What was that like?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I mean, I had never done so much time. It was hard. I remember the</br>first year went by really fast, the second year. But then after, I still</br>had that year-and-a-half left, I was like, &quot;Whoa.&quot; It seems forever. It</br>seemed forever.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And were you with dangerous criminals? Was it maximum security, or</br>no?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No. It was my first time, I was in level two. It was minimum. Medium</br>custody. We were in dorm living. But I mean, that's where it's at though. I</br>think it's more dangerous being in dorm living than it is in cell living.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Really?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, because cell living, they close you at nighttime and lock your</br>door and you're just there with your cell-y, but if you're in dorm living,</br>I mean, it's 150 beds, there's like 300 people. If something jumps off, I</br>mean, it's pretty wild.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And you were affiliated with the gang at that point?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, I was already—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did that help or hurt or have any effect?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I mean, it helped. It helped because I'm from Southern California, so</br>when you get to a certain place, people look out for each other. So if you</br>know somebody that's from your area, I mean, &quot;Hey, how you doing? What do</br>you need?&quot; &quot;Oh, I need some tennis shoes. I need some sandals. I need some</br>soap,&quot; whatever. So they looked out for you. Certain groups, people look</br>out for you. It was safe, I just had to participate in stuff. Whenever</br>something happened, you have to jump.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Three-and-a-half years is up, you get out, they're still not after</br>you --</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: That's when the INS hold came in. I was in Chuckwalla, Chuckwalla</br>Valley State Prison. It's over there by Blithe, right next to Arizona. I</br>was supposed to get out and I didn't get out. I went to go see my counselor</br>and I was like, &quot;Hey, what's up? I was supposed to get out yesterday.&quot;</br>She's like, &quot;No, you have an INS hold.&quot; So eventually they came and picked</br>me up. They sent me to Florence Federal Prison in Arizona, I was there a</br>couple weeks and they asked me if I wanted to see the judge or if I wanted</br>to sign deportation. That time I said, &quot;I want to see the judge.&quot; They gave</br>me bail, which wasn't a lot. I paid five thousand dollars for bail. I got</br>out on bail; that's when I got married. I married my long-time girlfriend.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh! So when did you meet her?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I met her though, well, being in trouble. I mean, I knew her family</br>for years. I knew her for years, but when I got in trouble, she was writing</br>me. She was writing me letters and stuff, so when I got out, I was kind of</br>courting her already. So we started going out. She wanted to help me out so</br>I wouldn't get deported, so we got married. And then I had my daughter with</br>her. We had our daughter. I still ended up getting deported though, because</br>I missed my court date. I moved and, I never got my court date, and they</br>came and got me at work, INS. It was the bounty hunters or the Marshalls or</br>something—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh my.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: —because I had skipped bail supposedly.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, I see.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: INS didn't come get me. They were some bounty hunters.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So they let you out of jail and said, &quot;You have to appear before a</br>judge concerning this INS hold&quot;?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Right.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And then you moved, and then—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: And then I never got the letter, so they thought I skipped bail. So</br>the bounty hunters came and got me, took me to the INS building in</br>downtown. Once I was there, my lawyer, he told me to go ahead and just sign</br>deportation, that he could get me my papers easier through the outs. So I</br>listened to him, which was stupid, and I signed my voluntary deportation.</br>And this was in '97, something like that. So I get out. I mean, they deport</br>me. That same day –I’m back in Mexico-I call my wife, &quot;Come and get me.</br>Bring my license. Bring one of your friends, or one of her boyfriends, or</br>husband, whoever you want to bring.&quot; I just crossed. I crossed right</br>across. My license, U.S. citizen. Plus, my name helps, because my name's</br>Abel Martine, but over there you only use your first last name.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, Abel Martin.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: So they're thinking my name's Abel Martin. And I would say it that</br>way. I wouldn't say Abel Martine. &quot;What's your name?&quot; &quot;Abel Martin.&quot; &quot;Where</br>were you born?&quot; &quot;Monrovia, California.&quot; “this guy's a white guy.”</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great. At that point, you had married her, but you hadn't had</br>any kids?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No, not until later on.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Until later on. And then were you still working in ... at the</br>enameling?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was working there.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, you were?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. I came back, I didn't tell them I got deported. I just came</br>back to work, I was using my license, everything.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And had you taken those courses yet?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was already a trainee. I had already taken some courses. I was</br>already an inspector trainee for both magnetic particle and for fluorescent</br>penetrant inspection. I was working already on my certifications.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: How many years was it between when you came back and you got finally</br>deported?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Well, when I got busted or when I was out? Five years.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Five years?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Five years I got in trouble, and then I did time.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, five years and then you did—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: See, I got busted in 2001.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So, it bought you five years of—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, I was there. Five years of freedom. But like I said, I worked.</br>I was working, I was paying my taxes. You know what's funny is the INS told</br>me they knew I was there. They were just waiting for me to mess up they</br>said. They knew I was there all that time. Once I started using my social</br>security, they knew I had already come back.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Well, you screwed up, unfortunately, but even if you hadn't, probably</br>nowadays, if they knew you were there, they would've come and gotten you.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, right away.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Regardless of whether you screwed up or not. Things have changed.</br>[Pause] So you had these two lovely children?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yes. One is from another marriage. From me getting in trouble, I lost</br>my first my wife. During the five years, I got divorced.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, you did?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. I got divorced. I met another girl, real nice girl, and I had</br>my son with her, right before I got busted.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was already in another relationship.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: But you keep in contact with both?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I keep in contact with both. We maintain friendship, we try to keep</br>in touch for the kids. Well, for my daughter. She's a real good person. We</br>didn't end in bad terms, so we're good. I'm not vindictive. I know how to</br>forget. I know how to forgive, forget. I mean, I hope they do the same with</br>me. It's better to get along, especially for your kids.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So in those five years you got divorced, found a new partner, and you</br>had your son. How old were the kids when you had the final drunken driving—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: When I got in trouble, my son wasn't even born yet. When I got caught</br>for evading, my wife was pregnant—or my ex, she's not with me any more. She</br>was pregnant. When I was in jail, my son was born. I got to see him in</br>visits and stuff, but at first I didn't get to see him until later on.</br>Because at first you got to fight your case, and then you can't see him</br>until later on.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: The final altercation was drunk driving, you were pulled over.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, I didn't want to stop. I knew they were going to get me, so I’m</br>like, “I’m gone,” took off. I probably wouldn't have got as much time. I</br>mean, I should've just stopped, but I figured I'm just going to give them a</br>run for their money. I figured it's just evading, what can they give me? It</br>turned out to be a long-ass time.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Six years.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And did both kids come and visit you?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. They used to both go visit me. Both my exes used to go see me,</br>too. I mean, because my daughter was small, so she used to take my</br>daughter. And my wife at the time used to go take my son. My parents used</br>to go see me. My friends used to go see me too. I had a lot of people go</br>see me. I mean, I wasn't alone. It was good.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's good. Was it the same jail or a different one?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I moved around. I was in Chino, Chuckwalla, I was in Soledad, Wasco,</br>Delano. You move around, you move around. Reception center, it's a place</br>where you're settled.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Was it different from your first time in jail?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: It was easier. It was easier, because I already knew the world. I</br>already knew what I had to do. I already knew how to stay out of trouble,</br>keep to myself. It was better. It was better. I went in there with a little</br>bit more—honestly, I was kind of dumb—but more confidence, because I</br>already knew what time it was.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did you know you were going to have to go back once you got out? Back</br>to Mexico?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: What do you mean?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did you know once you served your time that they were going to send</br>you back?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Oh, I knew it. I knew it. Yeah, I already knew because I already had</br>the INS hold. I couldn't participate in certain programs, fire camp,</br>because you were a risk. You were a flight risk, whatever. So I already</br>knew I had a hold. They told me I had a hold when I got busted. I was just</br>waiting to get out for them to shoot me back. I already knew they were</br>going to deport me.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So what was your plan?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Well, my plan was I was going to be here six months and go back. My</br>dad sent me way out here, because I could've stayed at TJ [Tijuana]. I mean</br>it's only two hours away from the house. But, I don't know, he figured out</br>I'll be better off this way. You know how they have the three strikes now</br>in Cali?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: So he was scared for me, crossing the border, they could give me</br>three strikes or whatever. So they were scared for that. That's why they</br>decided to send me out here to Mexico City. And I obliged, I said, &quot;All</br>right. I'll go out there a couple months, maybe a year.&quot; I've been here</br>fourteen, which helped out because I have family here. There's a lot of my</br>family that lives here, and I've met a lot of people here. I mean, I'm</br>alive. I'm all right. I'm all right. The only thing is that I never made a</br>plan for my future, because in my mind, I always want to go back. I don't</br>know if they should hear me, because right here, they know they're talking</br>about they want to have the Mexican dream here in Mexico, the American</br>dream here in Mexico. I want to go back. I want to go back, I'm not going</br>to lie. If I have to be here, which I've been here, I'll do what I can to</br>be a valuable person, to help out where I live and myself and my family.</br>But if I could go back, I would go back in a heartbeat. If they tell me,</br>&quot;Drop everything you have here and go.&quot; Let's go. I'll leave everything.</br>I'll leave everything and go. I mean, I consider it my county. Even though</br>I was involved with the gangs and stuff. But I mean, I didn't consider</br>myself a bad person. I love that place. I mean, I miss it. I miss it. To</br>this day, I can't get used to it. I can't get used to not having a car. I</br>can't get used to being able to ... I mean, out here is just expensive.</br>It's ridiculous. You got out with your family to go to McDonald's or</br>whatever and you're going to waste four days of work. It's crazy. A</br>hamburger, a special costs 150 pesos. Say you have two kids and your wife,</br>that's six hundred pesos, you're going to make that in two days. It's just</br>way out. And driving, I miss driving. I miss driving. I miss my family. I</br>miss being able to go to the beach. I was half hour away from the beach. It</br>was cool. It was good. I miss everything out there. I do miss it a lot.</br>It's hard to get used to it. It's hard to get used to it. The thing is too,</br>I mean, even relationship-wise. Out here, I've been through so many</br>relationships, because they can't get used to my way of life still. Because</br>I'm pro-cannabis and they can't—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: You're pro what?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Pro-cannabis.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh yeah?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. Out here, they see that as bad. They see it as a drug, addict</br>or whatever. I haven't drunk in five years. I don't even smoke cigarettes.</br>But because I smoke, they see you as a bad person. I don't know. Up there,</br>everything's getting legal now.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: [Laughs]. I was going to say, it's all getting legal. It's tough.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: But how's work out there? I mean, is there work out there really? I</br>mean, like in California, you don't know about California?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Well, I don't live there, but is there work there? Yeah, I think so.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I have a lot of friends that are coming out this way now too. They</br>were out there for years too—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: They're saying there's no work?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Rent is expensive, there's no work out there. I'm like, &quot;Come on.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, and you lived near Pasadena, you lived in an expensive part of</br>California. But I think there's work. But employment rates are low</br>throughout the States.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Is it?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: But since the recessions of 2008, the wages haven't gone up as much.</br>So, people aren't feeling …They’re still feeling poor. Poorer than they</br>were. So you think of yourself as American, not Mexican?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: <span id="a14386fc-9e66-4a1a-8e03-cbd79e1b55d9" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Identity, Mexican,  Monrovia">Oh, yeah. I think of myself as Mexican, but I do love America. United<br>
States, because we are in America here. I always consider myself as being a<br>
Monrovian, Californian. I mean, I paid my taxes, I went to school there. I<br>
grew up there. I guess it's not where you're born, it's where you were<br>
raised. I love this place though too. I do, because out here, it's a trip.<br>
I mean, out here, you won't go broke. If you're a lazy person, you won't<br>
have ... there's work everywhere out here. You can do whatever. I mean,<br>
helping a lady take her bags to the car, she'll give you ten pesos. If you<br>
look for stuff to do here, there's stuff to do here. Just me, I just miss<br>
my life you know? I miss my life. It's way different, put on a CD that<br>
somebody's going to like ... then somebody’s not going to look right, &quot;What<br>
the heck is that?&quot; I mean, it's just hard, especially when you live around<br>
everybody who don’t speak English. They don't hear your stuff. I do have a<br>
couple friends though that are from out there too though, that are deported<br>
also. Because we find each other. You'll see somebody that has tags and<br>
you'll be like, &quot;Hey, man. You lived out there before?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I lived in<br>
so-and-so. I lived in Huntington Beach,&quot; or &quot;I lived in Long Beach.&quot; &quot;Oh,<br>

went to the pen. I got into an altercation at a party and there were some<br>
shots fired, and I got busted. I mean, I didn't do it, but you can't tell<br>
how it goes. So, I got busted with the guys that were there too, and we all<br>

Anne: Raids?<br>

Abel: Raids, yeah. They're doing raids. INS [Immigration and Naturalization<br>
Service] raids and stuff at certain places. And we were scared it would<br>
happen at school and stuff. My dad, he was all right, but me and my mom<br>
were like, &quot;No, we need to fix our papers.&quot;<br>

messing with innocent people. I mean, it was just a bunch of kids, we hung<br>
out. Our rivalry started from high school, from the football games. That's<br>
how our rivalry started, with the other schools and stuff. That's how we<br>
started having, I guess, problems with other cities and stuff. But I mean,<br>
everybody talked to us. People weren't scared of us. I mean, &quot;Hey, how are<br>
you doing? What's up?&quot; &quot;Hey, Juan.&quot; They would talk to us. We only had<br>
problems with the people we didn't get along with. We weren't out there<br>

just, I had that double life. I used to like to go hang out, but I always<br>
liked to work.<br>

      <br>
Anne: Why do you think it happened?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
Abel: I think it was because I didn't have anybody to watch me. My mom had<br>
to go to work. She got out of work, like seven. My dad took off to work at<br>
two. He didn't get back until nighttime. So, I had this lapse of five hours<br>
that I would get off of school at 1:50 and I had a park across the street<br>
from my house that a lot of my friends now hang out at. We're hanging out.<br>
We started off just hanging out with the skateboards and the bikes. Little<br>
by little, it led to other things. So, I started hanging out with the<br>
homies.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

about that.<br>

same week, I started going to kindergarten, got enrolled in school. It was<br>
easier back then. It was in the 70s. So I started going to pre-kinder. I<br>
went to Mayflower Elementary School, all the way up to the fifth grade. I<br>
graduated, and went to Clifton Junior High School. And then I went to<br>
Monrovia High. But it was a big process. My mom and dad both had to<br>
work—going for that American dream. I am the only child, so I found my<br>
friends in the streets. So as a young kid, I started hanging out and I did<br>
become involved in the gang culture in LA.<br>

      </span></br>Anne: You had said that your dad actually came over legally for work</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And he worked with horses at the racetrack?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Santa Anita Race Track. Hollywood Park. He went back and forth to Del</br>Mar. He was a groomer, he worked for years in the track. Eventually he left</br>that and he started working for ACME Corporation, which later on turned</br>into Stanley Corporation. He retired from there.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: What did he do there?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: He was a machine operator. A little bit more money than track.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And your mom, what'd she do?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: My mom, she's the one who got me the job at Jan-Kens Enameling. She</br>She was in the painting department. I'm not sure, she was a racker in</br>masking. She worked at the same place I did. She's still working there.</br>She's been there since '84. To this day—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: —she's still working there.

My first years, elementary and junior high, I was in</br>a GATE program, gifted and talented education, I was pretty smart. I did</br>really good. When I started out hanging out with my friends, that's what</br>messed me up later on. And I didn't get in trouble a lot. I mean, I’ve only</br>been to jail three times. Except I did a lot of time for it. But I mean, I</br>wasn't going in and out of jail. I wasn't going to the halls. I've never</br>been to juvenile hall in my life. It wasn't until I was an adult that I</br>started getting in trouble. I mean, I had a little bit of run-ins, but I</br>never did any time. I was pretty good. I was scared of my mom and dad, they</br>whooped me [Chuckles]. So I tried to do good to please them.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: When you started getting with the gangs, what did that mean? What</br>kind of behavior did you guys engage in?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I don't want to defend the gang culture, but, I mean, we weren't</br>messing with innocent people. I mean, it was just a bunch of kids, we hung</br>out. Our rivalry started from high school, from the football games. That's</br>how our rivalry started, with the other schools and stuff. That's how we</br>started having, I guess, problems with other cities and stuff. But I mean,</br>everybody talked to us. People weren't scared of us. I mean, &quot;Hey, how are</br>you doing?

I never was involved in selling drugs. I never got busted</br>for stealing. I never even got busted for shoplifting. I was a good kid. I</br>just, I had that double life. I used to like to go hang out, but I always</br>liked to work.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did you start working as a kid to make money?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. I started working as a kid to dress the way I wanted to dress</br>because my mom would tell me, &quot;No, you can't wear those pants. They're too</br>big.&quot; Or, &quot;You can't wear that shirt.&quot; Or, &quot;No, you can't cut your hair</br>like that.&quot; So for me to get what I wanted to wear, I started working at</br>the swap meet. I used to work with these Chinese dudes selling shoes. I was</br>thirteen, fourteen. I started making my own money selling shoes and stuff.</br>That's how I started buying my clothes.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Because my mom was like, &quot;If you want to dress that way, you better</br>buy your own clothes.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did they know that you were involved in these gangs?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I think they might've suspected it, but they didn't want to believe</br>it until later, until they finally knew it, until I was deep in it. Because</br>they would see that I had little tattoos and stuff, but they wouldn't ... I</br>mean, they would see my friends as the kids I grew up with. They didn't see</br>them as gang members. They knew them as so-and-so's son, and so-and-so's</br>daughter. I mean, your mom's always going to think you're an angel no</br>matter what you do.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Does she still?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, still to this day. I love my mom, I love my dad. They're good.</br>They're good people.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So they were working really hard and you were just trying to make</br>your way?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So you got married at some point?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And you got in trouble at some point?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Which happened first?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I got in trouble first. Like I said, I had already gotten my papers</br>in '88.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Talk a little bit about that, about the papers, because that's</br>interesting.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Okay. Well, since we were illegal, so we were scared because they</br>were doing round-ups—I don't know what they call it when they start</br>deporting everybody and the buses come. I don't what they call</br>them…redadas. I don't know how they say it in English.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Raids?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Raids, yeah. They're doing raids. INS [Immigration and Naturalization</br>Service] raids and stuff at certain places. And we were scared it would</br>happen at school and stuff. My dad, he was all right, but me and my mom</br>were like, &quot;No, we need to fix our papers.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Was he still on a working visa or not?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No, he had already gotten his permanent residency.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, okay.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: So he's the one who helped us get our permanent residency through the</br>Amnesty Program. So, I guess if you had been there longer than ten years,</br>in the States, and had been working and stuff, you had to just prove with</br>the papers that you were working, you were paying your taxes and stuff. So</br>they gave us our green cards, my green card.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: The only thing is I didn't appreciate it, because I get it in '88 and</br>then 1990, I get busted for a joyride.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: A joyride?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Joyride, yeah. Get busted joyriding—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So, you stole a car?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: We stole a car, me and my buddy. The keys were in there, we took off.</br>We got in trouble. I did six months for that. But I never got deported. I</br>just showed them my green card, I got out.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: How old were you at that point?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was eighteen. I was eighteen-years-old. That was the first time I</br>ever got busted, eighteen years old, joyriding. Gave me six months. I got</br>out—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: You were eighteen, so it wasn't juvenile?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No. I went to LA County. I did my time in county jail. I didn't go to</br>prison. Then in 1992, that's when I got busted. That's the first time I</br>went to the pen. I got into an altercation at a party and there were some</br>shots fired, and I got busted. I mean, I didn't do it, but you can't tell</br>how it goes. So, I got busted with the guys that were there too, and we all</br>had to do time. I did three-and-a-half years off of that. They gave me</br>seven years, I did three and a half. Then—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: What was that like?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I mean, I had never done so much time. It was hard. I remember the</br>first year went by really fast, the second year. But then after, I still</br>had that year-and-a-half left, I was like, &quot;Whoa.&quot; It seems forever. It</br>seemed forever.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And were you with dangerous criminals? Was it maximum security, or</br>no?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No. It was my first time, I was in level two. It was minimum. Medium</br>custody. We were in dorm living. But I mean, that's where it's at though. I</br>think it's more dangerous being in dorm living than it is in cell living.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Really?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, because cell living, they close you at nighttime and lock your</br>door and you're just there with your cell-y, but if you're in dorm living,</br>I mean, it's 150 beds, there's like 300 people. If something jumps off, I</br>mean, it's pretty wild.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And you were affiliated with the gang at that point?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, I was already—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did that help or hurt or have any effect?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I mean, it helped. It helped because I'm from Southern California, so</br>when you get to a certain place, people look out for each other. So if you</br>know somebody that's from your area, I mean, &quot;Hey, how you doing? What do</br>you need?&quot; &quot;Oh, I need some tennis shoes. I need some sandals. I need some</br>soap,&quot; whatever. So they looked out for you. Certain groups, people look</br>out for you. It was safe, I just had to participate in stuff. Whenever</br>something happened, you have to jump.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Three-and-a-half years is up, you get out, they're still not after</br>you --</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: That's when the INS hold came in. I was in Chuckwalla, Chuckwalla</br>Valley State Prison. It's over there by Blithe, right next to Arizona. I</br>was supposed to get out and I didn't get out. I went to go see my counselor</br>and I was like, &quot;Hey, what's up? I was supposed to get out yesterday.&quot;</br>She's like, &quot;No, you have an INS hold.&quot; So eventually they came and picked</br>me up. They sent me to Florence Federal Prison in Arizona, I was there a</br>couple weeks and they asked me if I wanted to see the judge or if I wanted</br>to sign deportation. That time I said, &quot;I want to see the judge.&quot; They gave</br>me bail, which wasn't a lot. I paid five thousand dollars for bail. I got</br>out on bail; that's when I got married. I married my long-time girlfriend.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh! So when did you meet her?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I met her though, well, being in trouble. I mean, I knew her family</br>for years. I knew her for years, but when I got in trouble, she was writing</br>me. She was writing me letters and stuff, so when I got out, I was kind of</br>courting her already. So we started going out. She wanted to help me out so</br>I wouldn't get deported, so we got married. And then I had my daughter with</br>her. We had our daughter. I still ended up getting deported though, because</br>I missed my court date. I moved and, I never got my court date, and they</br>came and got me at work, INS. It was the bounty hunters or the Marshalls or</br>something—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh my.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: —because I had skipped bail supposedly.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, I see.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: INS didn't come get me. They were some bounty hunters.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So they let you out of jail and said, &quot;You have to appear before a</br>judge concerning this INS hold&quot;?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Right.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And then you moved, and then—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: And then I never got the letter, so they thought I skipped bail. So</br>the bounty hunters came and got me, took me to the INS building in</br>downtown. Once I was there, my lawyer, he told me to go ahead and just sign</br>deportation, that he could get me my papers easier through the outs. So I</br>listened to him, which was stupid, and I signed my voluntary deportation.</br>And this was in '97, something like that. So I get out. I mean, they deport</br>me. That same day –I’m back in Mexico-I call my wife, &quot;Come and get me.</br>Bring my license. Bring one of your friends, or one of her boyfriends, or</br>husband, whoever you want to bring.&quot; I just crossed. I crossed right</br>across. My license, U.S. citizen. Plus, my name helps, because my name's</br>Abel Martine, but over there you only use your first last name.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, Abel Martin.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: So they're thinking my name's Abel Martin. And I would say it that</br>way. I wouldn't say Abel Martine. &quot;What's your name?&quot; &quot;Abel Martin.&quot; &quot;Where</br>were you born?&quot; &quot;Monrovia, California.&quot; “this guy's a white guy.”</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great. At that point, you had married her, but you hadn't had</br>any kids?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No, not until later on.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Until later on. And then were you still working in ... at the</br>enameling?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was working there.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, you were?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. I came back, I didn't tell them I got deported. I just came</br>back to work, I was using my license, everything.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And had you taken those courses yet?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was already a trainee. I had already taken some courses. I was</br>already an inspector trainee for both magnetic particle and for fluorescent</br>penetrant inspection. I was working already on my certifications.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: How many years was it between when you came back and you got finally</br>deported?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Well, when I got busted or when I was out? Five years.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Five years?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Five years I got in trouble, and then I did time.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, five years and then you did—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: See, I got busted in 2001.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So, it bought you five years of—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, I was there. Five years of freedom. But like I said, I worked.</br>I was working, I was paying my taxes. You know what's funny is the INS told</br>me they knew I was there. They were just waiting for me to mess up they</br>said. They knew I was there all that time. Once I started using my social</br>security, they knew I had already come back.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Well, you screwed up, unfortunately, but even if you hadn't, probably</br>nowadays, if they knew you were there, they would've come and gotten you.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, right away.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Regardless of whether you screwed up or not. Things have changed.</br>[Pause] So you had these two lovely children?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yes. One is from another marriage. From me getting in trouble, I lost</br>my first my wife. During the five years, I got divorced.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, you did?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. I got divorced. I met another girl, real nice girl, and I had</br>my son with her, right before I got busted.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I was already in another relationship.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: But you keep in contact with both?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I keep in contact with both. We maintain friendship, we try to keep</br>in touch for the kids. Well, for my daughter. She's a real good person. We</br>didn't end in bad terms, so we're good. I'm not vindictive. I know how to</br>forget. I know how to forgive, forget. I mean, I hope they do the same with</br>me. It's better to get along, especially for your kids.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So in those five years you got divorced, found a new partner, and you</br>had your son. How old were the kids when you had the final drunken driving—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: When I got in trouble, my son wasn't even born yet. When I got caught</br>for evading, my wife was pregnant—or my ex, she's not with me any more. She</br>was pregnant. When I was in jail, my son was born. I got to see him in</br>visits and stuff, but at first I didn't get to see him until later on.</br>Because at first you got to fight your case, and then you can't see him</br>until later on.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: The final altercation was drunk driving, you were pulled over.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, I didn't want to stop. I knew they were going to get me, so I’m</br>like, “I’m gone,” took off. I probably wouldn't have got as much time. I</br>mean, I should've just stopped, but I figured I'm just going to give them a</br>run for their money. I figured it's just evading, what can they give me? It</br>turned out to be a long-ass time.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Six years.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And did both kids come and visit you?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. They used to both go visit me. Both my exes used to go see me,</br>too. I mean, because my daughter was small, so she used to take my</br>daughter. And my wife at the time used to go take my son. My parents used</br>to go see me. My friends used to go see me too. I had a lot of people go</br>see me. I mean, I wasn't alone. It was good.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's good. Was it the same jail or a different one?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I moved around. I was in Chino, Chuckwalla, I was in Soledad, Wasco,</br>Delano. You move around, you move around. Reception center, it's a place</br>where you're settled.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Was it different from your first time in jail?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: It was easier. It was easier, because I already knew the world. I</br>already knew what I had to do. I already knew how to stay out of trouble,</br>keep to myself. It was better. It was better. I went in there with a little</br>bit more—honestly, I was kind of dumb—but more confidence, because I</br>already knew what time it was.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did you know you were going to have to go back once you got out? Back</br>to Mexico?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: What do you mean?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Did you know once you served your time that they were going to send</br>you back?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Oh, I knew it. I knew it. Yeah, I already knew because I already had</br>the INS hold. I couldn't participate in certain programs, fire camp,</br>because you were a risk. You were a flight risk, whatever. So I already</br>knew I had a hold. They told me I had a hold when I got busted. I was just</br>waiting to get out for them to shoot me back. I already knew they were</br>going to deport me.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: So what was your plan?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Well, my plan was I was going to be here six months and go back. My</br>dad sent me way out here, because I could've stayed at TJ [Tijuana]. I mean</br>it's only two hours away from the house. But, I don't know, he figured out</br>I'll be better off this way. You know how they have the three strikes now</br>in Cali?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: So he was scared for me, crossing the border, they could give me</br>three strikes or whatever. So they were scared for that. That's why they</br>decided to send me out here to Mexico City. And I obliged, I said, &quot;All</br>right. I'll go out there a couple months, maybe a year.&quot; I've been here</br>fourteen, which helped out because I have family here. There's a lot of my</br>family that lives here, and I've met a lot of people here. I mean, I'm</br>alive. I'm all right. I'm all right. The only thing is that I never made a</br>plan for my future, because in my mind, I always want to go back. I don't</br>know if they should hear me, because right here, they know they're talking</br>about they want to have the Mexican dream here in Mexico, the American</br>dream here in Mexico. I want to go back. I want to go back, I'm not going</br>to lie. If I have to be here, which I've been here, I'll do what I can to</br>be a valuable person, to help out where I live and myself and my family.</br>But if I could go back, I would go back in a heartbeat. If they tell me,</br>&quot;Drop everything you have here and go.&quot; Let's go. I'll leave everything.</br>I'll leave everything and go. I mean, I consider it my county. Even though</br>I was involved with the gangs and stuff. But I mean, I didn't consider</br>myself a bad person. I love that place. I mean, I miss it. I miss it. To</br>this day, I can't get used to it. I can't get used to not having a car. I</br>can't get used to being able to ... I mean, out here is just expensive.</br>It's ridiculous. You got out with your family to go to McDonald's or</br>whatever and you're going to waste four days of work. It's crazy. A</br>hamburger, a special costs 150 pesos. Say you have two kids and your wife,</br>that's six hundred pesos, you're going to make that in two days. It's just</br>way out. And driving, I miss driving. I miss driving. I miss my family. I</br>miss being able to go to the beach. I was half hour away from the beach. It</br>was cool. It was good. I miss everything out there. I do miss it a lot.</br>It's hard to get used to it. It's hard to get used to it. The thing is too,</br>I mean, even relationship-wise. Out here, I've been through so many</br>relationships, because they can't get used to my way of life still. Because</br>I'm pro-cannabis and they can't—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: You're pro what?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Pro-cannabis.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh yeah?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah. Out here, they see that as bad. They see it as a drug, addict</br>or whatever. I haven't drunk in five years. I don't even smoke cigarettes.</br>But because I smoke, they see you as a bad person. I don't know. Up there,</br>everything's getting legal now.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: [Laughs]. I was going to say, it's all getting legal. It's tough.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: But how's work out there? I mean, is there work out there really? I</br>mean, like in California, you don't know about California?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Well, I don't live there, but is there work there? Yeah, I think so.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I have a lot of friends that are coming out this way now too. They</br>were out there for years too—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: They're saying there's no work?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Rent is expensive, there's no work out there. I'm like, &quot;Come on.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, and you lived near Pasadena, you lived in an expensive part of</br>California. But I think there's work. But employment rates are low</br>throughout the States.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Is it?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: But since the recessions of 2008, the wages haven't gone up as much.</br>So, people aren't feeling …They’re still feeling poor. Poorer than they</br>were. So you think of yourself as American, not Mexican?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Oh, yeah. I think of myself as Mexican, but I do love America. United</br>States, because we are in America here. I always consider myself as being a</br>Monrovian, Californian. I mean, I paid my taxes, I went to school there. I</br>grew up there. I guess it's not where you're born, it's where you were</br>raised. I love this place though too. I do, because out here, it's a trip.</br>I mean, out here, you won't go broke. If you're a lazy person, you won't</br>have ... there's work everywhere out here. You can do whatever. I mean,</br>helping a lady take her bags to the car, she'll give you ten pesos. If you</br>look for stuff to do here, there's stuff to do here. Just me, I just miss</br>my life you know? I miss my life. It's way different, put on a CD that</br>somebody's going to like ... then somebody’s not going to look right, &quot;What</br>the heck is that?&quot; I mean, it's just hard, especially when you live around</br>everybody who don’t speak English. They don't hear your stuff. I do have a</br>couple friends though that are from out there too though, that are deported</br>also. Because we find each other. You'll see somebody that has tags and</br>you'll be like, &quot;Hey, man. You lived out there before?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I lived in</br>so-and-so. I lived in Huntington Beach,&quot; or &quot;I lived in Long Beach.&quot; &quot;Oh,</br>is that right? Oh man, I lived in Monrovia.&quot; Become friends. That's why I</br>still speak English. I mean, I don't lose my—</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Oh, no. You have not at all.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I try to practice it. Plus, I'm always speaking with my daughter and</br>my son. I listen to English music, I watch movies. I go buy the movies. I'm</br>not guilty of buying bootleg movies, that's not right. But I go buy the</br>movies and I make sure that I can watch them in English. I read books too,</br>I read English books and stuff. I try to, I try to. I just read Gone with</br>the Wind. It's a good book, man. The Outsiders. When my daughter comes out</br>here, she's the one that brings me the books. She should be coming out here</br>in, I'm thinking in August—August, September.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, my dad's out here right now, but he's in Jalisco. He went to</br>stop by to see his brothers and stuff and he's coming down here. He came to</br>get some dental work done because it's cheaper out here.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's what I hear. So you apparently live alone in your own</br>apartment?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, I’ve got my own apartment.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And you can entertain the family when they come?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, exactly. I have a guestroom. I rent from one of my aunts. It</br>was her son's house, my cousin's house, but he built his house apart,</br>because it's upstairs from his mom and dad's house. So he more or less did</br>it so they can help themselves out with the rent. So I rent it from them.</br>I'm all right. I try to maintain positive. I try to keep myself positive.</br>But I mean, I do miss it. I'm glad I can say this. Nobody understands me</br>when I talk to them about it, they're like, &quot;Oh, you're cool out here.&quot; No,</br>you don't understand. I tell these guys here from Mexico, my friends here</br>in Mexico, I tell them, &quot;Imagine you lived here in Tecámac all your life</br>and all the sudden they tell you, 'No, you can't be here.' And they take</br>you somewhere else. What would you do? How would you go about finding</br>friends? How would you go about finding work?&quot; I mean, it messes with you.</br>It does. It does mess with you psychologically. It does depress you. I got</br>out of it. It helped me stop drinking. I stopped drinking, because when you</br>drink, I mean, that makes it worse. It makes it worse, so I thank God I</br>stopped drinking, because I was drinking a lot. A lot. Every day, I didn't</br>care. But I'm better off now.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Yeah, if you drink, it's hard to work too.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Yeah, you can't. You don't go to work. You don't go. But I'm hoping,</br>I'm hoping I can go back. I mean, I need to go to the U.S. embassy and</br>check it. Sometimes everyone tells me, &quot;I mean, you're an ex-gang member.</br>They're not going to let you go back.&quot; But I mean, you never know.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: I think the current administration, nothing good is going to happen</br>[Abel chuckles]. But maybe a new administration, maybe some immigration</br>policy will be more forgiving of deportees, in at least visits.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Well, I mean, I'm thinking of working on a hardship case because my</br>mom and dad are older. And I'm the only son. If they don't want to come</br>back, they're U.S. citizens, who's going to take care of them? We're</br>looking into that. Maybe I can do it that way, because they're telling me</br>have my kids ask for me because my daughter, she already turned twenty,</br>she's twenty-three. So supposedly she could ask for me to return. But</br>that's if you don't have a prior record. I think I'm better off on having</br>my mom and dad asking for me because they're the ones who would need me to</br>help them out, because my daughter, she's on her own. She can do whatever.</br>But I need to check it out.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Keep working on it.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I try to come (to seminars), whenever they have things like this or</br>whenever they have the certificates, I try to take them. I'm trying to</br>build a little curriculum of stuff to have, to show them I'm trying. I</br>mean, I work, and I never got in trouble here. Since I've been here, I've</br>never stepped in jail. Ever. Me getting deported just woke me up, dude. I</br>messed my whole life up for messing around.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And you've learned this new skill in Mexico, masonry.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: So I could use that out there. You get paid good being out there,</br>being a mason. Good money. Carpentry. You learn a little bit of everything</br>out here working.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: It's interesting, I've talked to a lot of deportees who say it's hard</br>to get into the construction industry, but you didn't find it that hard?</br>Was it connections through relatives?</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: No. I mean, you know what it is? I guess I had all my papers. When I</br>first got here, I used to get taken off the bus a lot. This happened today.</br>That's why I was late. They had these checkpoints and they make all the men</br>get off the bus and they search you. I don't know if you heard about stuff</br>like that? So they take all the men out and they check you for weapons and</br>stuff and they let you back on the bus. It took like half hour. [Pause]. I</br>forgot what I was saying.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: I was asking you about your papers.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Oh, about the papers. About what?</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Because I was saying that you got this job in construction—</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Oh, how did I get it? Okay. Well, the reason I got my ID was because</br>they were taking me off the bus and they asked me if I was an MS gang</br>member or whatever, so I went and got my ID. So I've had it since I've been</br>here. So once you have your ID, you can get your Curp [Mexican</br>identification code], you can get your social security number and all that.</br>So it was easy for me to get hooked up. And then later on learning the</br>trade, now I get my own jobs from word of mouth. So I'll tell somebody,</br>&quot;Hey, I mean, if you need something done, let people know I know how to do</br>certain type of work,&quot; whatever. And they're like, &quot;All right. Give me a</br>call right now.&quot; Right now, I'm working at a cousin's house, doing the</br>driveway, pouring concrete and stuff and laying brick down. So from there,</br>I get chances to work, from word of mouth, they call it, letting people</br>know. Because I'll do everything. I'll paint, whatever I can do. Whatever I</br>can do to make money.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: That's great. You're doing really well.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Thank you. I'm trying, I'm trying. Trying to stay positive. Trying to</br>stay grounded.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Well, it's great that your family can come see you and that they do</br>come see you, and hopefully you'll find a way to get back.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: I hope.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: I hope so, too.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: And if not, I'll make the best of it here. I mean, that's the thing</br>that I always keep in mind too. I mean, it's not always going to happen the</br>way you want it. It's just when I was going to get out this last time, I</br>was praying to God that I'm going to get out, and when I get out, I'm going</br>to do good.... God knows where he's going to put you. I'm here.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: Well, good luck with everything.</br>      </br>      </br>Abel: Thank you.</br>      </br>      </br>Anne: And thank you so much.</br>      </div><\p></p>
