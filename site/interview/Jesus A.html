DACA meant that you could apply for citizenship, and you went through</br>   that process?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, like I was saying, growing up without your citizenship and just</br>   as an illegal immigrant, you kind of get the feeling you're a criminal and</br>   that's the kind of path. That's like, I don't know, you tell that to your</br>   kid, &quot;Hey you're illegal&quot; and that's what they kind of start to think as</br>   they get older. Like, “Don't trust authority, don't go to the police.” You</br>   just get in this mindset of wanting to be a criminal because it’s just kind</br>   of what path is chosen for you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So did you become a criminal?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I can’t say too much about that, but, you know, like most people,</br>   yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: But what caused you to leave the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: What caused me? I hadn't seen my dad in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15 years</span> and, well, like</br>   most criminals, the government starts turning some heads.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you detained and deported? Voluntary departure?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: With voluntary departure did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No, it was a really weird experience, was not expecting to walk past</br>   and pay a nickel to get across the border, and also my phone line cutting</br>   out as soon as I got across the bridge from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">El Paso</span>. I was like, “I still</br>   needed internet you know?” [Both laugh].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Who knew? When you walked over the border into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, were you</br>   greeted by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> authorities?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: A taxi. I got into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Juarez</span> and there were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> taxi drivers just</br>   standing there. The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> person to greet me was a cholo he was just like,</br>   &quot;Hey what are doing, where you going?&quot; I was just like, “Nope.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So no assistance, you came with your own money I assume that you had</br>   to...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you have been back for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span> now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I’m at a shelter. It’s not the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time, hopefully it's the last</br>   time. [Pause]. I know the company’s got the best intentions though so…</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, you're waiting for a company that's—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Well, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">New Comienzos</span> to hook me up with a spot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Since you have been back have you pursued any studies?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, I am currently going to enter into Hola Code, which is computer</br>   programming.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's cool. Do you think that you have special capabilities in that</br>   area?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, yes most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. Have you worked for pay since you have been back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Teleperformance</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So it’s a call center?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, a call center. Working for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">FedEx</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How much were you paid for your current or most recent job?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">1,200 pesos</span> a week.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you feel safe in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: More or less.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Have you been a victim of a violent crime while you've been here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Since I’ve been here? No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant than you would've—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No, I feel a lot less vulnerable here, a lot more accepted.</br>   [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you still have family living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you have your mom?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Anyone else?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Just all her sisters and brothers in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Any siblings?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, my brother and my sister. Then my whole dad's side of the</br>   family is over here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Are any of your relatives <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> citizens?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: My brother.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: He was born there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Well, no, he was born here. Oh, and my sister too. My brother was</br>   born in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: But he became a citizen?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, just recently.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, it’s your brother and your sister?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You haven't been here too long. Maybe they'll come to see you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No, no. I don't know, I was...like I said, was kind of a criminal</br>   for a while and burnt all those bridges.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you're estranged?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Well I told them it's probably safer for all of us if I kind of just</br>   [Whoosh noise].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I’m sorry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I was like, “I’ll just kind of build my own life and then when I'm</br>   ready I'll contact you guys.” You make some mistakes in your life and you</br>   don't realize that at some point you can't really turn back, and you know.</br>   It’s just a little bit safer to not turn back to your family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you feel like it would be unsafe to go back for you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay, do you think they would ever think of coming back to live in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Uh, probably not, no.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you currently follow <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> news now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And again, is it through the same kind of sources that we talked</br>   about before?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> politics are just, they're fun.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I'm not sure if they're fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: With <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Donald Trump</span> you're just like, &quot;Whoa what is going on, why is</br>   he saying that?&quot; [Both laugh]. Again, he's just a talking head. A lot of</br>   people don't realize that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think you will return to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">some day</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No, I want to see <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">South America</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Central America</span>. I got really into</br>   the whole contras and all that stuff during <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the 80's</span> with the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">CIA</span> scandal.</br>   I just kind of want to see how it’s left all these countries south of</br>   Mexico. That's the whole reason I came down here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see. You're the traveler?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you want to travel south?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, everyone tells me it’s dangerous. They're like, “It gets more</br>   dangerous the further south you go.” I was like, “Well you only get <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span></br>   life you know.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, they say it’s pretty dangerous in that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Northern Triangle</span>, in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guatemala</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">El Salvador</span>, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Honduras</span>. But some of the other places aren’t</br>   as bad. Do you currently participate or volunteer in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Right now, I am, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: With New Comienzos?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus Eloy</span></br> </br> </br>   Narrator</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita Isaacs</span></br> </br> </br>   Interviewer</br> </br> </br>   (Follow-up interview <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">5 months later</span>)</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">June 5, 2019</span></br> </br> </br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, Mexico</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the past few months</span> been difficult for you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No. It's actually been a lot easier.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, things have gotten better then?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I finally got my own place to live at. I have a job, so that's cool.</br>   And at my job, I get to speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and it's optional, both</br>   languages.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Great. So, when we saw you, what were you doing? You were</br>   unemployed?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I was unemployed. I had just gotten to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, so it was a</br>   little difficult. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What about your social life, has that gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, it has. I opened up a lot more. I got into a relationship.</br>   Recently, just got out. So, it was like the doors closed on me real quick,</br>   and now I'm more outgoing, a little bit more open to everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you're single again?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Has anything gotten worse? Being single? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Being single. [Laughs]. But yeah, other than that...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Looks like everything worked out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, have you become aware of any programs that help returning</br>   migrants?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah. I went with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Israel</span> to some meeting where it was like all the</br>   other big programs that actually help people out. And it was kind of</br>   amazing to see that there was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">nine</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">ten</span> different people</br>   representing their own associations and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, these were sort of non-governmental programs, or were they...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: As far as I know, yeah. Non-governmental.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay. What kind of programs? Do you know what they were about? Do</br>   you remember their names?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I know a few of them. I don't know them by name. But I know some of</br>   them were centered towards helping women returning, some of them were just</br>   centered towards helping migrants from southern countries.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Sort of economically, psychologically...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, just everything. Pretty much what <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">New Comienzos</span> does, but ours</br>   is more centered towards <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span> returnees and deportees. Some of</br>   these were more centered towards the specifics, like just women, women</br>   abused, stuff like that. So, that was pretty cool.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you gotten any assistance from any of these programs?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: From New Comienzos, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you taken any classes or enrolled in an educational program</br>   since we talked?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I was taking a computer programming and hacking course, but I got</br>   sick. I got really sick.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh, no. What happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I moved to the biggest city in the world. Well, one of the biggest</br>   and it was just a matter of time until I got sick. Yeah. I got really sick.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Stomach problems.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Well, it was like a flu, and it was just all these things. I was</br>   shaking really bad and I was throwing up all the time. It just makes sense.</br>   Moving from the small town that I was in—well, I guess I was in Chihuahua</br>   at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, and coming here—<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">twenty-four million</span> people. I was bound to get</br>   sick, eventually.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. So, do you currently have a job?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How many hours do you work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Let's see. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">Three</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">six</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">nine</span> times <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">Forty-five</span>.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">Forty-five hours</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">Forty-five or more</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How much are you earning?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: It's a commission-based structure, but we're making <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">US</span> dollars in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's the job?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Just being a carrier, connecting semi loads to semi drivers.</br>   [Chuckles]. So just kind of being a broker.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah. And then, pretty much doing that. It's a little tough, because</br>   you got to wrap your mind around the entire industry. You're not just</br>   connecting one person to another. You have to understand all the standards</br>   and what the drivers want—connect with them on a personal level, if they're</br>   going to go see their families over <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the weekend</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Who do you currently live with?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: By myself right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Which of your relatives live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>? Do your grandparents live</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> the country?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> the country.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: My dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, grandparents on your dad's side?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Anybody else, other than grandparents? Do you have any brothers and</br>   sisters who live here? Your parents are in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, well my mom's in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> with her family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Your dad?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: He's down here. Yeah. Chihuahua.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No children?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No, not yet. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Partner? That was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">last week</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How long has it been since you broke up?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a week</span>. How did you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You said you broke up!</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: You're following me around. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You said you broke up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No, we're trying to work things out. We did hang out <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">last night</span>, but</br>   it's just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> different cultures. It's hard to kind of wrap your mind</br>   around being in a relationship, especially when my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> is más o menos.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: And trying to communicate trust. Because we have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> different</br>   standards of trust too. Because I come from a small town, and she's—well</br>   this huge city so communication's different, cultural-wise and also, I</br>   don't know. A lot of different factors into it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, she's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That's really interesting, because I hadn't thought about that. So,</br>   sort of in a relationship, how does that cultural difference manifest</br>   itself?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Cultural differences? Like I said, she's from the big city too, so</br>   it's not just the cultural difference, but it's like a big city cultural</br>   difference too. I don't know. I come from a small town where you don't</br>   really hang out with your ex. You're not really connected with the people</br>   that did you wrong because everybody in the town knows each other. Why are</br>   you going to go and hang out with this person? Especially when you're</br>   dating someone else. Why would you go back with your ex? But this is such a</br>   big city, and it makes sense that you wouldn't want to... It's so easy to</br>   get lost here so why would you want to lose connection with somebody you</br>   already know? I don't know if that makes any sense. So then for me, it was</br>   like, 'Why are you still talking to your ex?&quot; So, a little bit of jealousy</br>   on my part, but then a little jealousy on her part too. Because whenever</br>   she'd see me talking to another girl, even if it was work related, it was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you talking to her?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I'm also curious whether living in the States and having</br>   relationships in the States makes you approach your relationship</br>   differently than a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> woman would. And what are those differences?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: The differences that I've noticed so far, I feel like coming from</br>   the States and being binational, I'm quicker to move on in the</br>   relationship. It's like, &quot;Oh, let's move in together.&quot; Over there, you're</br>   more independent, there's more money, so you're more willing to get your</br>   own apartment and be like, &quot;Hey, just come stay at my place.&quot; And then they</br>   stay for a week or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>. And over here it's like, &quot;Oh hey, come and stay at</br>   my place.&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, I can't do that, because my mom, this and</br>   that.&quot; And moving in with your partner here, is pretty much like getting</br>   married. So, it's a big cultural difference there too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: The other thing I was wondering about was sort of machismo?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Machismo?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think that growing up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>—I don't even know how to</br>   ask the question.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: You can ask it either way.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Like I don't even know. Are you different from other <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> men in</br>   a relationship kind of is the question.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah. That's the difficult thing, is not only am I binational and</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span>, I'm from the north of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. A lot of my culture from the north</br>   over there, it's really about machismo. And I was like, &quot;Oh man.&quot; Over</br>   there, the reality is still women being abused, and all that stuff. So,</br>   when I tend to drink, sometimes I get angry and I started getting</br>   aggressive and like I told my ex, I was like, &quot;I can't drink, I can't</br>   drink. Not with you.&quot; We tried drinking a few times, and things just kind</br>   of got out of control. She would become controlling, and then I'd start to</br>   get angry. I start to see my dad's side inside of me. And I'm just like,</br>   &quot;No, this just can't happen.&quot; So, that's where we were running into issues</br>   too. And coming from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, I was raised in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">the Pacific Northwest</span> and</br>   there's a big movement for Civil Rights and stuff over there too, women's</br>   rights and equality. So, I have a lot of those same mentalities still, like</br>   respect women, try and keep things fair. But then over here, I feel like</br>   women have been brought down so much, that they want to see how much more</br>   they can get.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: It got to a point where I was being controlled on who I could hang</br>   out with, what I was doing, where I was going, and then I was like, &quot;Whoa,</br>   this is too much. I got respect for you, but you can't yell at me because</br>   there's a girl in the same room as me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I guess in the States too, that was different. Right? So, the women</br>   are different.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What you're saying is, because you told me—it's interesting that you</br>   found programs that were interested in women's rights, sort of. That sounds</br>   like more of an Americanized guy almost. But what you're also talking about</br>   is, maybe women in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> are less possessive, or understanding more. What</br>   do you think?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Like I said, [Sigh], over here, and I hate to say this, it's like</br>   law is lawless. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Israel</span> has brought this up before too. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">1%</span> of crimes get</br>   solved here. The reality is, if a husband gets mad at their wife, whatever</br>   amount of violence he brings onto her, chances are it's not going to get</br>   resolved, and not quickly and it's not going to be fair way. So, I just</br>   feel like—oh wait, what was the question <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> more time? Sorry about that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I was wondering whether women are more jealous or possessive here</br>   than in the States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah. So, I feel like up in the States because the laws are more</br>   fair, if you hit a woman up in the States, the law's going to come down on</br>   you. Regardless of whether or not you actually did hit them, or didn't, the</br>   law's going to come down, and it's going to take it down on the man</br>   whatever way possible. And so, women over there are more willing to be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're messing around with this other girl. I'll</br>   go mess around with someone else.&quot; So, it's safer for them. They can go out</br>   to the club and be like, &quot;This guy, he doesn't mean this. So, I'm going to</br>   go out with my girls, hook up with another dude.” Over here, if they try</br>   and do that, sometimes you get the issue of where the guy gets jealous and</br>   like I said, the crimes don't get solved here very quick, so...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: They get away with more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: They get away with more. That's a really harsh reality is that I</br>   think women live in fear here. The possibility that, &quot;I can't go out to the</br>   club and hang out with my girls, just in case the guy thinks something.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. Also, I'm just thinking that when I grew up, I could hang</br>   around with guys, and my boyfriend would say, &quot;Okay. They're just your</br>   friends.&quot; They accepted it. I wonder whether—that's also what I was trying</br>   to ask—whether girls are more possessive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah, definitely. That's the weird thing. That's what was weird to</br>   me in this relationship. I just let her, &quot;No, you can hang out with your</br>   friends. Go on ahead. Go- bye.&quot; Even with their ex, I was like, &quot;I really</br>   don't like it.&quot; We argued about it for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a few weeks</span> and I was like, &quot;You</br>   know what, you're from a big city. I just don't understand. I'm not seeing</br>   the world through your eyes, but I'm going to just let it go. Go on ahead,</br>   if you want to hang out with him.&quot; And she would hang out with him every</br>   once in a while. And it was kind of eating me up inside. And then, like I</br>   said, I got drunk one day, snagged her cell phone, and I was like, &quot;Let me</br>   go through this really quick.&quot; And she had erased all the messages with her</br>   ex.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was just like, &quot;Whoa, what are you doing?&quot; And then I snapped out</br>   of it, “I can't be drinking around you. I can't believe I did that. That's</br>   not me. That's not who I am.” But then, I had already given her a reason to</br>   be like, &quot;Wow, you're going to get violent, and snag the phone out of my</br>   hands.&quot; And I'm just like, &quot;That's not who I am.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you're bicultural in that respect too. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah. You can see where I was fighting myself that time. Just like,</br>   &quot;Give me it.&quot; &quot;No. Sorry. Here you go.&quot; And then, it was like I blocked</br>   everything out. Forget that she'd deleted the messages, but then it kept</br>   eating me up inside. Like, &quot;What'd you delete? What'd you delete?&quot;</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know. I just never brought it up. It's like I wanted to</br>   know what was on those conversations, but then again, I was like, &quot;What am</br>   I going to gain from that?&quot; And I had been talking to my ex, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the first two   months</span> we were together, and I felt really bad. I wasn't going to delete</br>   the messages because I wanted to show her. I wanted enough time to pass by</br>   and be like, &quot;Hey, this might hurt us, but I want you to know that this was</br>   what I was doing.&quot; She waited until I was asleep, grabbed my phone and</br>   unlocked it, went through it, took pictures of all our conversations and</br>   then kept using it against me. I was like, &quot;What are you doing? And you're</br>   weaponizing something that I was going to show you. I didn't delete it for</br>   a reason. If I wanted to hide it from you, I would have just deleted it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Would that have happened in the States, all of this?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Easily. [Chuckles]. Yeah. I think a girl would have grabbed my phone</br>   immediately. Just waited until I fell asleep. But I don't know. Honestly, I</br>   feel like over there, you're more comfortable, because you know that you</br>   can both go and screw around, if it comes down to that. Over here, they're</br>   constantly thinking like, &quot;He's going to do something.&quot; It's weird. I</br>   almost feel like it's part of the culture for men to be more able to do</br>   whatever they want, and women just be at the house. It's a part of the</br>   culture that I don't really like. I don't really enjoy it because there's a</br>   lot of fear. I don't know if that made sense. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: It makes total sense, total sense. And it's something that I just</br>   hadn't really had the opportunity to talk about. So, do you have siblings</br>   who live here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, no children, no partner for the moment. Aunt, uncles, cousins</br>   live here, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>? Not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, but <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Are you in contact with any of these people?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No, but my mom's going to be coming down soon.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: She said my aunt and uncle are running for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Presidente Municipal de   </span>Durango, so I don't know. Maybe I'd heard it wrong, but I don't know.</br>   That's kind of cool. It means that my family has got political ties and</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: That's cool. Yeah. My mom's like, &quot;Just so you know, your family's</br>   bigger than you think. And when I come down there, I want to explain it to</br>   you.&quot; So, I'm excited. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That's pretty emotional.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you know when?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: I'm not sure. Not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">a hundred percent</span>. She just got her residence, so</br>   that's good. I was like, &quot;Congratulations. You made it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That's really great. So, your mother lives in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. Who else of</br>   your relatives live in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: My aunts, uncles, my brother, sister.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No children?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No children, that I know of.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you're in touch with your mom, obviously. Are you in touch with</br>   your brothers and sisters?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: With your aunts or uncles that live in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Are you considering going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: No. Maybe. I don't know. [Chuckles] It's like, &quot;Why make the same</br>   mistake twice?&quot; I kind of want to see <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>. I want to see different</br>   countries.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span>: Why <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>? Because it's a cleaner <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>, so I've heard. I</br>   don't know if it is. I hear a lot of people say <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>'s like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>, but it's greener. There's more forest, and it's cleaner, and the</br>   crime's not as bad. I feel like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span>'s my standard now, and I either</br>   want to go better, or see what's gotten worse, go further south. See these</br>   countries that are suffering from organized crime and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>'s nicer too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jesus</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Immigration status, Being secretive, Broken system, Hiding/lying">Yes, like I was saying, growing up without your citizenship and just   as an illegal immigrant, you kind of get the feeling you're a criminal and   that's the kind of path. That's like, I don't know, you tell that to your   kid, &quot;Hey you're illegal&quot; and that's what they kind of start to think as   they get older. Like, “Don't trust authority, don't go to the police.” You   just get in this mindset of wanting to be a criminal because it’s just kind   of what path is chosen for you.    </span> Anne: So did you become a criminal?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I can’t say too much about that, but, you know, like most people,</br>   yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But what caused you to leave the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: What caused me? I hadn't seen my dad in 15 years and, well, like</br>   most criminals, the government starts turning some heads.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you detained and deported? Voluntary departure?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: With voluntary departure did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, it was a really weird experience, was not expecting to walk past</br>   and pay a nickel to get across the border, and also my phone line cutting</br>   out as soon as I got across the bridge from El Paso. I was like, “I still</br>   needed internet you know?” [Both laugh].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who knew? When you walked over the border into Mexico, were you</br>   greeted by Mexican authorities?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: A taxi. I got into Juarez and there were two taxi drivers just</br>   standing there. The first person to greet me was a cholo he was just like,</br>   &quot;Hey what are doing, where you going?&quot; I was just like, “Nope.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So no assistance, you came with your own money I assume that you had</br>   to...?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you have been back for six months?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You live in Mexico City now?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I’m at a shelter. It’s not the first time, hopefully it's the last</br>   time. [Pause]. I know the company’s got the best intentions though so…</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, you're waiting for a company that's—</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well, New Comienzos to hook me up with a spot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Since you have been back have you pursued any studies?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, I am currently going to enter into Hola Code, which is computer</br>   programming.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's cool. Do you think that you have special capabilities in that</br>   area?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, yes most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Have you worked for pay since you have been back?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, Teleperformance.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it’s a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, a call center. Working for FedEx.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How much were you paid for your current or most recent job?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: 1,200 pesos a week.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: More or less.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you been a victim of a violent crime while you've been here?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Since I’ve been here? No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant than you would've—</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, I feel a lot less vulnerable here, a lot more accepted.</br>   [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you still have family living in the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you have your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Anyone else?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Just all her sisters and brothers in the United States.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Any siblings?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, my brother and my sister. Then my whole dad's side of the</br>   family is over here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are any of your relatives U.S. citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: My brother.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He was born there?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well, no, he was born here. Oh, and my sister too. My brother was</br>   born in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But he became a citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, just recently.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it’s your brother and your sister?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You haven't been here too long. Maybe they'll come to see you.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, no. I don't know, I was...like I said, was kind of a criminal</br>   for a while and burnt all those bridges.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you're estranged?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well I told them it's probably safer for all of us if I kind of just</br>   [Whoosh noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I’m sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was like, “I’ll just kind of build my own life and then when I'm</br>   ready I'll contact you guys.” You make some mistakes in your life and you</br>   don't realize that at some point you can't really turn back, and you know.</br>   It’s just a little bit safer to not turn back to your family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you feel like it would be unsafe to go back for you?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay, do you think they would ever think of coming back to live in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Uh, probably not, no.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you currently follow U.S. news now?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And again, is it through the same kind of sources that we talked</br>   about before?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, U.S. politics are just, they're fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I'm not sure if they're fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: With Donald Trump you're just like, &quot;Whoa what is going on, why is</br>   he saying that?&quot; [Both laugh]. Again, he's just a talking head. A lot of</br>   people don't realize that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think you will return to the United States some day?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, I want to see South America, Central America. I got really into</br>   the whole contras and all that stuff during the 80's with the CIA scandal.</br>   I just kind of want to see how it’s left all these countries south of</br>   Mexico. That's the whole reason I came down here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. You're the traveler?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you want to travel south?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, everyone tells me it’s dangerous. They're like, “It gets more</br>   dangerous the further south you go.” I was like, “Well you only get one</br>   life you know.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, they say it’s pretty dangerous in that Northern Triangle, in</br>   Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. But some of the other places aren’t</br>   as bad. Do you currently participate or volunteer in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Right now, I am, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: With New Comienzos?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Jesus Eloy</br> </br> </br>   Narrator</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita Isaacs</br> </br> </br>   Interviewer</br> </br> </br>   (Follow-up interview 5 months later)</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   June 5, 2019</br> </br> </br>   in Mexico City, Mexico</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, have the past few months been difficult for you?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No. It's actually been a lot easier.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, things have gotten better then?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I finally got my own place to live at. I have a job, so that's cool.</br>   And at my job, I get to speak English and Spanish and it's optional, both</br>   languages.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Great. So, when we saw you, what were you doing? You were</br>   unemployed?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was unemployed. I had just gotten to Mexico City, so it was a</br>   little difficult. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about your social life, has that gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, it has. I opened up a lot more. I got into a relationship.</br>   Recently, just got out. So, it was like the doors closed on me real quick,</br>   and now I'm more outgoing, a little bit more open to everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're single again?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Has anything gotten worse? Being single? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Being single. [Laughs]. But yeah, other than that...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Looks like everything worked out.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, have you become aware of any programs that help returning</br>   migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. I went with Israel to some meeting where it was like all the</br>   other big programs that actually help people out. And it was kind of</br>   amazing to see that there was like nine or ten different people</br>   representing their own associations and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, these were sort of non-governmental programs, or were they...?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: As far as I know, yeah. Non-governmental.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. What kind of programs? Do you know what they were about? Do</br>   you remember their names?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I know a few of them. I don't know them by name. But I know some of</br>   them were centered towards helping women returning, some of them were just</br>   centered towards helping migrants from southern countries.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sort of economically, psychologically...?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, just everything. Pretty much what New Comienzos does, but ours</br>   is more centered towards United States returnees and deportees. Some of</br>   these were more centered towards the specifics, like just women, women</br>   abused, stuff like that. So, that was pretty cool.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you gotten any assistance from any of these programs?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: From New Comienzos, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you taken any classes or enrolled in an educational program</br>   since we talked?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was taking a computer programming and hacking course, but I got</br>   sick. I got really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, no. What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I moved to the biggest city in the world. Well, one of the biggest</br>   and it was just a matter of time until I got sick. Yeah. I got really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Stomach problems.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well, it was like a flu, and it was just all these things. I was</br>   shaking really bad and I was throwing up all the time. It just makes sense.</br>   Moving from the small town that I was in—well, I guess I was in Chihuahua</br>   at first, and coming here—twenty-four million people. I was bound to get</br>   sick, eventually.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, do you currently have a job?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many hours do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Let's see. Three, four, five, six, nine times five. Forty-five.</br>   Forty-five hours. Forty-five or more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much are you earning?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: It's a commission-based structure, but we're making US dollars in</br>   Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the job?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Just being a carrier, connecting semi loads to semi drivers.</br>   [Chuckles]. So just kind of being a broker.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. And then, pretty much doing that. It's a little tough, because</br>   you got to wrap your mind around the entire industry. You're not just</br>   connecting one person to another. You have to understand all the standards</br>   and what the drivers want—connect with them on a personal level, if they're</br>   going to go see their families over the weekend.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who do you currently live with?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: By myself right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which of your relatives live in Mexico? Do your grandparents live</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Mexico City, or Mexico the country?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Mexico the country.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: My dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, grandparents on your dad's side?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Anybody else, other than grandparents? Do you have any brothers and</br>   sisters who live here? Your parents are in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, well my mom's in the States with her family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: He's down here. Yeah. Chihuahua.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No children?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, not yet. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Partner? That was last week.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long has it been since you broke up?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, about a week. How did you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said you broke up!</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: You're following me around. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said you broke up.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, we're trying to work things out. We did hang out last night, but</br>   it's just two different cultures. It's hard to kind of wrap your mind</br>   around being in a relationship, especially when my Spanish is más o menos.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: And trying to communicate trust. Because we have two different</br>   standards of trust too. Because I come from a small town, and she's—well</br>   this huge city so communication's different, cultural-wise and also, I</br>   don't know. A lot of different factors into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, she's Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's really interesting, because I hadn't thought about that. So,</br>   sort of in a relationship, how does that cultural difference manifest</br>   itself?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Cultural differences? Like I said, she's from the big city too, so</br>   it's not just the cultural difference, but it's like a big city cultural</br>   difference too. I don't know. I come from a small town where you don't</br>   really hang out with your ex. You're not really connected with the people</br>   that did you wrong because everybody in the town knows each other. Why are</br>   you going to go and hang out with this person? Especially when you're</br>   dating someone else. Why would you go back with your ex? But this is such a</br>   big city, and it makes sense that you wouldn't want to... It's so easy to</br>   get lost here so why would you want to lose connection with somebody you</br>   already know? I don't know if that makes any sense. So then for me, it was</br>   like, 'Why are you still talking to your ex?&quot; So, a little bit of jealousy</br>   on my part, but then a little jealousy on her part too. Because whenever</br>   she'd see me talking to another girl, even if it was work related, it was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you talking to her?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm also curious whether living in the States and having</br>   relationships in the States makes you approach your relationship</br>   differently than a Mexican woman would. And what are those differences?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: The differences that I've noticed so far, I feel like coming from</br>   the States and being binational, I'm quicker to move on in the</br>   relationship. It's like, &quot;Oh, let's move in together.&quot; Over there, you're</br>   more independent, there's more money, so you're more willing to get your</br>   own apartment and be like, &quot;Hey, just come stay at my place.&quot; And then they</br>   stay for a week or two. And over here it's like, &quot;Oh hey, come and stay at</br>   my place.&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, I can't do that, because my mom, this and</br>   that.&quot; And moving in with your partner here, is pretty much like getting</br>   married. So, it's a big cultural difference there too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The other thing I was wondering about was sort of machismo?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Machismo?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that growing up in the States—I don't even know how to</br>   ask the question.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: You can ask it either way.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences, Relationships">Anita: Like I don't even know. Are you different from other Mexican men in   a relationship kind of is the question.     Jesus: Yeah. That's the difficult thing, is not only am I binational and   Hispanic, I'm from the north of Mexico. A lot of my culture from the north   over there, it's really about machismo. And I was like, &quot;Oh man.&quot; Over   there, the reality is still women being abused, and all that stuff. So,   when I tend to drink, sometimes I get angry and I started getting   aggressive and like I told my ex, I was like, &quot;I can't drink, I can't   drink. Not with you.&quot; We tried drinking a few times, and things just kind   of got out of control. She would become controlling, and then I'd start to   get angry. I start to see my dad's side inside of me. And I'm just like,   &quot;No, this just can't happen.&quot; So, that's where we were running into issues   too. And coming from the States, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest and   there's a big movement for Civil Rights and stuff over there too, women's   rights and equality. So, I have a lot of those same mentalities still, like   respect women, try and keep things fair. But then over here, I feel like   women have been brought down so much, that they want to see how much more   they can get.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Relationships, Falling in love, Return to Mexico, Challenges, Language, Cultural differences">Anita: Partner? That was last week.     Jesus: Yeah. [Laughs]     Anita: How long has it been since you broke up?     Jesus: Yeah, about a week. How did you know?     Anita: You said you broke up!

Anita: So, these were sort of non-governmental programs, or were they...?     Jesus: As far as I know, yeah. Non-governmental.     Anita: Okay. What kind of programs? Do you know what they were about? Do   you remember their names?     Jesus: I know a few of them. I don't know them by name. But I know some of   them were centered towards helping women returning, some of them were just   centered towards helping migrants from southern countries.     Anita: Sort of economically, psychologically...?     Jesus: Yeah, just everything. Pretty much what New Comienzos does, but ours   is more centered towards United States returnees and deportees. Some of   these were more centered towards the specifics, like just women, women   abused, stuff like that. So, that was pretty cool.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">Israel</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico">Israel</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Employment, Return to Mexico, Jobs">Anita: So, have the past few months been difficult for you?

But yeah, other than that...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Looks like everything worked out.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, have you become aware of any programs that help returning</br>   migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. I went with Israel to some meeting where it was like all the</br>   other big programs that actually help people out.

So, that was pretty cool.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you gotten any assistance from any of these programs?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: From New Comienzos, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you taken any classes or enrolled in an educational program</br>   since we talked?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was taking a computer programming and hacking course, but I got</br>   sick. I got really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, no. What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I moved to the biggest city in the world. Well, one of the biggest</br>   and it was just a matter of time until I got sick. Yeah. I got really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Stomach problems.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well, it was like a flu, and it was just all these things. I was</br>   shaking really bad and I was throwing up all the time. It just makes sense.</br>   Moving from the small town that I was in—well, I guess I was in Chihuahua</br>   at first, and coming here—twenty-four million people. I was bound to get</br>   sick, eventually.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, do you currently have a job?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many hours do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Let's see. Three, four, five, six, nine times five. Forty-five.</br>   Forty-five hours. Forty-five or more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much are you earning?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: It's a commission-based structure, but we're making US dollars in</br>   Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the job?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Just being a carrier, connecting semi loads to semi drivers.</br>   [Chuckles]. So just kind of being a broker.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. And then, pretty much doing that. It's a little tough, because</br>   you got to wrap your mind around the entire industry. You're not just</br>   connecting one person to another. You have to understand all the standards</br>   and what the drivers want—connect with them on a personal level, if they're</br>   going to go see their families over the weekend.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who do you currently live with?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: By myself right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which of your relatives live in Mexico? Do your grandparents live</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Mexico City, or Mexico the country?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Mexico the country.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: My dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, grandparents on your dad's side?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Anybody else, other than grandparents? Do you have any brothers and</br>   sisters who live here? Your parents are in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, well my mom's in the States with her family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: He's down here. Yeah. Chihuahua.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No children?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, not yet. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Partner? That was last week.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long has it been since you broke up?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, about a week. How did you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said you broke up!</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: You're following me around. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said you broke up.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, we're trying to work things out. We did hang out last night, but</br>   it's just two different cultures. It's hard to kind of wrap your mind</br>   around being in a relationship, especially when my Spanish is más o menos.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: And trying to communicate trust. Because we have two different</br>   standards of trust too. Because I come from a small town, and she's—well</br>   this huge city so communication's different, cultural-wise and also, I</br>   don't know. A lot of different factors into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, she's Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's really interesting, because I hadn't thought about that. So,</br>   sort of in a relationship, how does that cultural difference manifest</br>   itself?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Cultural differences? Like I said, she's from the big city too, so</br>   it's not just the cultural difference, but it's like a big city cultural</br>   difference too. I don't know. I come from a small town where you don't</br>   really hang out with your ex. You're not really connected with the people</br>   that did you wrong because everybody in the town knows each other. Why are</br>   you going to go and hang out with this person? Especially when you're</br>   dating someone else. Why would you go back with your ex? But this is such a</br>   big city, and it makes sense that you wouldn't want to... It's so easy to</br>   get lost here so why would you want to lose connection with somebody you</br>   already know? I don't know if that makes any sense. So then for me, it was</br>   like, 'Why are you still talking to your ex?&quot; So, a little bit of jealousy</br>   on my part, but then a little jealousy on her part too. Because whenever</br>   she'd see me talking to another girl, even if it was work related, it was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you talking to her?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm also curious whether living in the States and having</br>   relationships in the States makes you approach your relationship</br>   differently than a Mexican woman would. And what are those differences?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: The differences that I've noticed so far, I feel like coming from</br>   the States and being binational, I'm quicker to move on in the</br>   relationship. It's like, &quot;Oh, let's move in together.&quot; Over there, you're</br>   more independent, there's more money, so you're more willing to get your</br>   own apartment and be like, &quot;Hey, just come stay at my place.&quot; And then they</br>   stay for a week or two. And over here it's like, &quot;Oh hey, come and stay at</br>   my place.&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, I can't do that, because my mom, this and</br>   that.&quot; And moving in with your partner here, is pretty much like getting</br>   married. So, it's a big cultural difference there too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The other thing I was wondering about was sort of machismo?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Machismo?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that growing up in the States—I don't even know how to</br>   ask the question.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: You can ask it either way.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like I don't even know. Are you different from other Mexican men in</br>   a relationship kind of is the question.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. That's the difficult thing, is not only am I binational and</br>   Hispanic, I'm from the north of Mexico. A lot of my culture from the north</br>   over there, it's really about machismo. And I was like, &quot;Oh man.&quot; Over</br>   there, the reality is still women being abused, and all that stuff. So,</br>   when I tend to drink, sometimes I get angry and I started getting</br>   aggressive and like I told my ex, I was like, &quot;I can't drink, I can't</br>   drink. Not with you.&quot; We tried drinking a few times, and things just kind</br>   of got out of control. She would become controlling, and then I'd start to</br>   get angry. I start to see my dad's side inside of me. And I'm just like,</br>   &quot;No, this just can't happen.&quot; So, that's where we were running into issues</br>   too. And coming from the States, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest and</br>   there's a big movement for Civil Rights and stuff over there too, women's</br>   rights and equality. So, I have a lot of those same mentalities still, like</br>   respect women, try and keep things fair. But then over here, I feel like</br>   women have been brought down so much, that they want to see how much more</br>   they can get.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: It got to a point where I was being controlled on who I could hang</br>   out with, what I was doing, where I was going, and then I was like, &quot;Whoa,</br>   this is too much. I got respect for you, but you can't yell at me because</br>   there's a girl in the same room as me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I guess in the States too, that was different. Right? So, the women</br>   are different.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What you're saying is, because you told me—it's interesting that you</br>   found programs that were interested in women's rights, sort of. That sounds</br>   like more of an Americanized guy almost. But what you're also talking about</br>   is, maybe women in the US are less possessive, or understanding more. What</br>   do you think?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico,  safety, Cultural differences, Relationships, Lawyer, Corruption">Jesus: Like I said, [Sigh], over here, and I hate to say this, it's like   law is lawless. Israel has brought this up before too. 1% of crimes get   solved here. The reality is, if a husband gets mad at their wife, whatever   amount of violence he brings onto her, chances are it's not going to get   resolved, and not quickly and it's not going to be fair way. So, I just   feel like—oh wait, what was the question one more time? Sorry about that.     Anita: I was wondering whether women are more jealous or possessive here   than in the States?     Jesus: Yeah. So, I feel like up in the States because the laws are more   fair, if you hit a woman up in the States, the law's going to come down on   you. Regardless of whether or not you actually did hit them, or didn't, the   law's going to come down, and it's going to take it down on the man   whatever way possible. And so, women over there are more willing to be   like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're messing around with this other girl. I'll   go mess around with someone else.&quot; So, it's safer for them. They can go out   to the club and be like, &quot;This guy, he doesn't mean this. So, I'm going to   go out with my girls, hook up with another dude.” Over here, if they try   and do that, sometimes you get the issue of where the guy gets jealous and   like I said, the crimes don't get solved here very quick, so...    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Relationships, Cultural differences">I'm also curious whether living in the States and having   relationships in the States makes you approach your relationship   differently than a Mexican woman would.

The first person to greet me was a cholo he was just like,</br>   &quot;Hey what are doing, where you going?&quot; I was just like, “Nope.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So no assistance, you came with your own money I assume that you had</br>   to...?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you have been back for six months?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You live in Mexico City now?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I’m at a shelter. It’s not the first time, hopefully it's the last</br>   time. [Pause]. I know the company’s got the best intentions though so…</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, you're waiting for a company that's—</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well, New Comienzos to hook me up with a spot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Since you have been back have you pursued any studies?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, I am currently going to enter into Hola Code, which is computer</br>   programming.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's cool. Do you think that you have special capabilities in that</br>   area?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, yes most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Have you worked for pay since you have been back?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, Teleperformance.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it’s a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, a call center. Working for FedEx.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How much were you paid for your current or most recent job?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: 1,200 pesos a week.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: More or less.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you been a victim of a violent crime while you've been here?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Since I’ve been here? No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant than you would've—</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, I feel a lot less vulnerable here, a lot more accepted.</br>   [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you still have family living in the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you have your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Anyone else?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Just all her sisters and brothers in the United States.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Any siblings?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, my brother and my sister. Then my whole dad's side of the</br>   family is over here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are any of your relatives U.S. citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: My brother.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He was born there?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well, no, he was born here. Oh, and my sister too. My brother was</br>   born in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But he became a citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, just recently.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it’s your brother and your sister?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You haven't been here too long. Maybe they'll come to see you.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, no. I don't know, I was...like I said, was kind of a criminal</br>   for a while and burnt all those bridges.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you're estranged?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well I told them it's probably safer for all of us if I kind of just</br>   [Whoosh noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I’m sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was like, “I’ll just kind of build my own life and then when I'm</br>   ready I'll contact you guys.” You make some mistakes in your life and you</br>   don't realize that at some point you can't really turn back, and you know.</br>   It’s just a little bit safer to not turn back to your family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you feel like it would be unsafe to go back for you?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay, do you think they would ever think of coming back to live in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Uh, probably not, no.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you currently follow U.S. news now?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, most definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And again, is it through the same kind of sources that we talked</br>   about before?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, U.S. politics are just, they're fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I'm not sure if they're fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: With Donald Trump you're just like, &quot;Whoa what is going on, why is</br>   he saying that?&quot; [Both laugh]. Again, he's just a talking head. A lot of</br>   people don't realize that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think you will return to the United States some day?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, I want to see South America, Central America. I got really into</br>   the whole contras and all that stuff during the 80's with the CIA scandal.</br>   I just kind of want to see how it’s left all these countries south of</br>   Mexico. That's the whole reason I came down here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. You're the traveler?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you want to travel south?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, everyone tells me it’s dangerous. They're like, “It gets more</br>   dangerous the further south you go.” I was like, “Well you only get one</br>   life you know.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, they say it’s pretty dangerous in that Northern Triangle, in</br>   Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. But some of the other places aren’t</br>   as bad. Do you currently participate or volunteer in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Right now, I am, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: With New Comienzos?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Jesus Eloy</br> </br> </br>   Narrator</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita Isaacs</br> </br> </br>   Interviewer</br> </br> </br>   (Follow-up interview 5 months later)</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   June 5, 2019</br> </br> </br>   in Mexico City, Mexico</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, have the past few months been difficult for you?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No. It's actually been a lot easier.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, things have gotten better then?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I finally got my own place to live at. I have a job, so that's cool.</br>   And at my job, I get to speak English and Spanish and it's optional, both</br>   languages.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Great. So, when we saw you, what were you doing? You were</br>   unemployed?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was unemployed. I had just gotten to Mexico City, so it was a</br>   little difficult. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about your social life, has that gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, it has. I opened up a lot more. I got into a relationship.</br>   Recently, just got out. So, it was like the doors closed on me real quick,</br>   and now I'm more outgoing, a little bit more open to everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're single again?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Has anything gotten worse? Being single? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Being single. [Laughs]. But yeah, other than that...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Looks like everything worked out.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, have you become aware of any programs that help returning</br>   migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. I went with Israel to some meeting where it was like all the</br>   other big programs that actually help people out. And it was kind of</br>   amazing to see that there was like nine or ten different people</br>   representing their own associations and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, these were sort of non-governmental programs, or were they...?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: As far as I know, yeah. Non-governmental.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. What kind of programs? Do you know what they were about? Do</br>   you remember their names?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I know a few of them. I don't know them by name. But I know some of</br>   them were centered towards helping women returning, some of them were just</br>   centered towards helping migrants from southern countries.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sort of economically, psychologically...?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, just everything. Pretty much what New Comienzos does, but ours</br>   is more centered towards United States returnees and deportees. Some of</br>   these were more centered towards the specifics, like just women, women</br>   abused, stuff like that. So, that was pretty cool.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you gotten any assistance from any of these programs?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: From New Comienzos, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you taken any classes or enrolled in an educational program</br>   since we talked?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was taking a computer programming and hacking course, but I got</br>   sick. I got really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, no. What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I moved to the biggest city in the world. Well, one of the biggest</br>   and it was just a matter of time until I got sick. Yeah. I got really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Stomach problems.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Well, it was like a flu, and it was just all these things. I was</br>   shaking really bad and I was throwing up all the time. It just makes sense.</br>   Moving from the small town that I was in—well, I guess I was in Chihuahua</br>   at first, and coming here—twenty-four million people. I was bound to get</br>   sick, eventually.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, do you currently have a job?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many hours do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Let's see. Three, four, five, six, nine times five. Forty-five.</br>   Forty-five hours. Forty-five or more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much are you earning?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: It's a commission-based structure, but we're making US dollars in</br>   Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the job?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Just being a carrier, connecting semi loads to semi drivers.</br>   [Chuckles]. So just kind of being a broker.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. And then, pretty much doing that. It's a little tough, because</br>   you got to wrap your mind around the entire industry. You're not just</br>   connecting one person to another. You have to understand all the standards</br>   and what the drivers want—connect with them on a personal level, if they're</br>   going to go see their families over the weekend.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who do you currently live with?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: By myself right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which of your relatives live in Mexico? Do your grandparents live</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Mexico City, or Mexico the country?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Mexico the country.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: My dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, grandparents on your dad's side?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Anybody else, other than grandparents? Do you have any brothers and</br>   sisters who live here? Your parents are in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, well my mom's in the States with her family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: He's down here. Yeah. Chihuahua.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No children?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, not yet. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Partner? That was last week.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long has it been since you broke up?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, about a week. How did you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said you broke up!</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: You're following me around. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said you broke up.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, we're trying to work things out. We did hang out last night, but</br>   it's just two different cultures. It's hard to kind of wrap your mind</br>   around being in a relationship, especially when my Spanish is más o menos.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: And trying to communicate trust. Because we have two different</br>   standards of trust too. Because I come from a small town, and she's—well</br>   this huge city so communication's different, cultural-wise and also, I</br>   don't know. A lot of different factors into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, she's Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's really interesting, because I hadn't thought about that. So,</br>   sort of in a relationship, how does that cultural difference manifest</br>   itself?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Cultural differences? Like I said, she's from the big city too, so</br>   it's not just the cultural difference, but it's like a big city cultural</br>   difference too. I don't know. I come from a small town where you don't</br>   really hang out with your ex. You're not really connected with the people</br>   that did you wrong because everybody in the town knows each other. Why are</br>   you going to go and hang out with this person? Especially when you're</br>   dating someone else. Why would you go back with your ex? But this is such a</br>   big city, and it makes sense that you wouldn't want to... It's so easy to</br>   get lost here so why would you want to lose connection with somebody you</br>   already know? I don't know if that makes any sense. So then for me, it was</br>   like, 'Why are you still talking to your ex?&quot; So, a little bit of jealousy</br>   on my part, but then a little jealousy on her part too. Because whenever</br>   she'd see me talking to another girl, even if it was work related, it was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you talking to her?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm also curious whether living in the States and having</br>   relationships in the States makes you approach your relationship</br>   differently than a Mexican woman would. And what are those differences?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: The differences that I've noticed so far, I feel like coming from</br>   the States and being binational, I'm quicker to move on in the</br>   relationship. It's like, &quot;Oh, let's move in together.&quot; Over there, you're</br>   more independent, there's more money, so you're more willing to get your</br>   own apartment and be like, &quot;Hey, just come stay at my place.&quot; And then they</br>   stay for a week or two. And over here it's like, &quot;Oh hey, come and stay at</br>   my place.&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, I can't do that, because my mom, this and</br>   that.&quot; And moving in with your partner here, is pretty much like getting</br>   married. So, it's a big cultural difference there too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The other thing I was wondering about was sort of machismo?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Machismo?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that growing up in the States—I don't even know how to</br>   ask the question.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: You can ask it either way.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like I don't even know. Are you different from other Mexican men in</br>   a relationship kind of is the question.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. That's the difficult thing, is not only am I binational and</br>   Hispanic, I'm from the north of Mexico. A lot of my culture from the north</br>   over there, it's really about machismo. And I was like, &quot;Oh man.&quot; Over</br>   there, the reality is still women being abused, and all that stuff. So,</br>   when I tend to drink, sometimes I get angry and I started getting</br>   aggressive and like I told my ex, I was like, &quot;I can't drink, I can't</br>   drink. Not with you.&quot; We tried drinking a few times, and things just kind</br>   of got out of control. She would become controlling, and then I'd start to</br>   get angry. I start to see my dad's side inside of me. And I'm just like,</br>   &quot;No, this just can't happen.&quot; So, that's where we were running into issues</br>   too. And coming from the States, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest and</br>   there's a big movement for Civil Rights and stuff over there too, women's</br>   rights and equality. So, I have a lot of those same mentalities still, like</br>   respect women, try and keep things fair. But then over here, I feel like</br>   women have been brought down so much, that they want to see how much more</br>   they can get.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: It got to a point where I was being controlled on who I could hang</br>   out with, what I was doing, where I was going, and then I was like, &quot;Whoa,</br>   this is too much. I got respect for you, but you can't yell at me because</br>   there's a girl in the same room as me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I guess in the States too, that was different. Right? So, the women</br>   are different.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What you're saying is, because you told me—it's interesting that you</br>   found programs that were interested in women's rights, sort of. That sounds</br>   like more of an Americanized guy almost. But what you're also talking about</br>   is, maybe women in the US are less possessive, or understanding more. What</br>   do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Like I said, [Sigh], over here, and I hate to say this, it's like</br>   law is lawless. Israel has brought this up before too. 1% of crimes get</br>   solved here. The reality is, if a husband gets mad at their wife, whatever</br>   amount of violence he brings onto her, chances are it's not going to get</br>   resolved, and not quickly and it's not going to be fair way. So, I just</br>   feel like—oh wait, what was the question one more time? Sorry about that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I was wondering whether women are more jealous or possessive here</br>   than in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. So, I feel like up in the States because the laws are more</br>   fair, if you hit a woman up in the States, the law's going to come down on</br>   you. Regardless of whether or not you actually did hit them, or didn't, the</br>   law's going to come down, and it's going to take it down on the man</br>   whatever way possible. And so, women over there are more willing to be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're messing around with this other girl. I'll</br>   go mess around with someone else.&quot; So, it's safer for them. They can go out</br>   to the club and be like, &quot;This guy, he doesn't mean this. So, I'm going to</br>   go out with my girls, hook up with another dude.” Over here, if they try</br>   and do that, sometimes you get the issue of where the guy gets jealous and</br>   like I said, the crimes don't get solved here very quick, so...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They get away with more.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: They get away with more. That's a really harsh reality is that I</br>   think women live in fear here. The possibility that, &quot;I can't go out to the</br>   club and hang out with my girls, just in case the guy thinks something.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Also, I'm just thinking that when I grew up, I could hang</br>   around with guys, and my boyfriend would say, &quot;Okay. They're just your</br>   friends.&quot; They accepted it. I wonder whether—that's also what I was trying</br>   to ask—whether girls are more possessive.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah, definitely. That's the weird thing. That's what was weird to</br>   me in this relationship. I just let her, &quot;No, you can hang out with your</br>   friends. Go on ahead. Go- bye.&quot; Even with their ex, I was like, &quot;I really</br>   don't like it.&quot; We argued about it for a few weeks and I was like, &quot;You</br>   know what, you're from a big city. I just don't understand. I'm not seeing</br>   the world through your eyes, but I'm going to just let it go. Go on ahead,</br>   if you want to hang out with him.&quot; And she would hang out with him every</br>   once in a while. And it was kind of eating me up inside. And then, like I</br>   said, I got drunk one day, snagged her cell phone, and I was like, &quot;Let me</br>   go through this really quick.&quot; And she had erased all the messages with her</br>   ex.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I was just like, &quot;Whoa, what are you doing?&quot; And then I snapped out</br>   of it, “I can't be drinking around you. I can't believe I did that. That's</br>   not me. That's not who I am.” But then, I had already given her a reason to</br>   be like, &quot;Wow, you're going to get violent, and snag the phone out of my</br>   hands.&quot; And I'm just like, &quot;That's not who I am.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're bicultural in that respect too. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. You can see where I was fighting myself that time. Just like,</br>   &quot;Give me it.&quot; &quot;No. Sorry. Here you go.&quot; And then, it was like I blocked</br>   everything out. Forget that she'd deleted the messages, but then it kept</br>   eating me up inside. Like, &quot;What'd you delete? What'd you delete?&quot;</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know. I just never brought it up. It's like I wanted to</br>   know what was on those conversations, but then again, I was like, &quot;What am</br>   I going to gain from that?&quot; And I had been talking to my ex, the first two</br>   months we were together, and I felt really bad. I wasn't going to delete</br>   the messages because I wanted to show her. I wanted enough time to pass by</br>   and be like, &quot;Hey, this might hurt us, but I want you to know that this was</br>   what I was doing.&quot; She waited until I was asleep, grabbed my phone and</br>   unlocked it, went through it, took pictures of all our conversations and</br>   then kept using it against me. I was like, &quot;What are you doing? And you're</br>   weaponizing something that I was going to show you. I didn't delete it for</br>   a reason. If I wanted to hide it from you, I would have just deleted it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Would that have happened in the States, all of this?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Easily. [Chuckles]. Yeah. I think a girl would have grabbed my phone</br>   immediately. Just waited until I fell asleep. But I don't know. Honestly, I</br>   feel like over there, you're more comfortable, because you know that you</br>   can both go and screw around, if it comes down to that. Over here, they're</br>   constantly thinking like, &quot;He's going to do something.&quot; It's weird. I</br>   almost feel like it's part of the culture for men to be more able to do</br>   whatever they want, and women just be at the house. It's a part of the</br>   culture that I don't really like. I don't really enjoy it because there's a</br>   lot of fear. I don't know if that made sense. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It makes total sense, total sense. And it's something that I just</br>   hadn't really had the opportunity to talk about. So, do you have siblings</br>   who live here?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, no children, no partner for the moment. Aunt, uncles, cousins</br>   live here, in Mexico? Not Mexico City, but Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are you in contact with any of these people?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No, but my mom's going to be coming down soon.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: She said my aunt and uncle are running for Presidente Municipal de</br>   Durango, so I don't know. Maybe I'd heard it wrong, but I don't know.</br>   That's kind of cool. It means that my family has got political ties and</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: That's cool. Yeah. My mom's like, &quot;Just so you know, your family's</br>   bigger than you think. And when I come down there, I want to explain it to</br>   you.&quot; So, I'm excited. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's pretty emotional.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you know when?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: I'm not sure. Not a hundred percent. She just got her residence, so</br>   that's good. I was like, &quot;Congratulations. You made it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's really great. So, your mother lives in the US. Who else of</br>   your relatives live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: My aunts, uncles, my brother, sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No children?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No children, that I know of.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're in touch with your mom, obviously. Are you in touch with</br>   your brothers and sisters?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: With your aunts or uncles that live in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are you considering going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: No. Maybe. I don't know. [Chuckles] It's like, &quot;Why make the same</br>   mistake twice?&quot; I kind of want to see Canada. I want to see different</br>   countries.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why Canada?</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Why Canada? Because it's a cleaner United States, so I've heard. I</br>   don't know if it is. I hear a lot of people say Canada's like the United</br>   States, but it's greener. There's more forest, and it's cleaner, and the</br>   crime's not as bad. I feel like America's my standard now, and I either</br>   want to go better, or see what's gotten worse, go further south. See these</br>   countries that are suffering from organized crime and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Canada's nicer too.</br> </br> </br>   Jesus: Yeah. So, I've heard.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
