And we really appreciate you</br>   being here. We understand that it could be difficult when you think back.</br>   So if it is, I'm really sorry, and I hope that it's not painful.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Well, not as much as what people will think, but yeah, it is.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, of course. So again, we're really thankful. So <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>, when did</br>   you go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I've been there since I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years old</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And then, when did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">22 years old</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">29</span>. Well, I've been back on and off. Been firmly here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about five years</span>. But after I left the military, I came back here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You were in the military in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So tell me. You grew up as an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Where did you grow up?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New York City</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Where in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New York</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Brooklyn</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New York</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Okay. I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Red Hook</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Now it's nicer. Back in the day, it was still gangs. It was still a</br>   lot of discrimination, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Blacks</span> against <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanics</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanics</span> against</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanics</span>. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, growing up, you felt like you were an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I didn't know I was illegal until I actually applied to college.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah. So that was of a little trip and then-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Then you went to college?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: By the military. So I had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> options. Lawyer told me, because my</br>   father didn't register to pay taxes, that I couldn't legally get my own</br>   papers started. So either I had to get married by an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizen, have</br>   a baby by an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizen, or join the military. So that's whenever</br>   9/11 was going on. And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a few years later</span>, so that's when I decided to</br>   join up. My brother joined when 9/11 was going on. He actually went to</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="EVENT">Desert Storm</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And I was given the options. So I didn't want a kid. I didn't want</br>   a family, I didn't want a wife. So I said the best option was the military.</br>   And military pays for the school. So I got a scholarship for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">NYU</span>. After I</br>   went to apply for that, they renounced my scholarship because I was</br>   illegal. So I had to apply like everyone else, and lost my spot. But being</br>   in the military, we have certain leeways where you can actually get</br>   reassigned your spot that was given to you. So I didn't lose a spot right</br>   there in the moment, but it was very hard to study and be in the military.</br>   The military had assumptions. I was stateside maybe <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four months</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three   months</span>, or even <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">weeks</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you were trying to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">NYU</span> while you were in the military.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes. Most of it was virtual studies. Some of them were actually</br>   in-class studies. But after that, I actually was able to conclude</br>   university. But basically my time that I came back, I would go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New York</span></br>   because I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Fort Benning</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>. That's where we were stationed out</br>   there, and I'm out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Virginia</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Norfolk</span>. We went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Fort Benning</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span></br>   because that's an airborne school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Whenever I was stateside, I would have traveled to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New York</span>, get my</br>   classes, my exams, talk to my teachers, do everything I could in the time I</br>   was given. And if I was called upon, then I will come back and leave.</br>   That's basically how I struggled.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you graduated.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Congratulations.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Wow. That's great. What did you major in?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Psychology.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What a success story.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Not really. I mean, people come and look at me and they don't see</br>   your typical <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> that was deported because of drugs or was deported</br>   because of gang fights or was deported because of the wrong place, wrong</br>   time. I actually came back because I gave up on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. There's</br>   a lot of things that when you're in the military, you see, you just keep it</br>   on the down low. And things you see over there, friends you see, friends</br>   you see leave, friends you see gone. And it's just difficult to actually</br>   believe in a system that protects you while you're in there, and</br>   does…supposedly cares about you, and brainwashes you. It's very different</br>   when you're on the outside.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: When you're not needed anymore, or you gave up on being that</br>   military &quot;all you can be&quot; motto BS, it really changes you. I mean, there</br>   are certain jobs that tell you that you're doing good for people, and</br>   there's also the little flip coin where you see shit over there and you're</br>   like, &quot;Ugh, this is not what I signed up for.&quot; And then you come back to</br>   the States, and you see ignorant people talk down on people about their</br>   rights, about their cultures, about their maybe situations. And it’s not</br>   enough for…it was not enough for me to stay there because in a literal</br>   sense, I gave up on humanity from the States because I saw so much more</br>   humanity from the people we were fighting, the people we were trying to</br>   kill, and other people around the world, that their mindsets were very</br>   different from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> mindsets.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I think the majority of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> have that patriotic stigmatism</br>   inside of them. And they really don't see outside of the borders, outside</br>   of the world. I mean the news, the media covers certain things, but it</br>   doesn't really cover a lot of aspects of what can really change the mindset</br>   of everyone. There's a famous book called on the Living the Society, where</br>   a quote was given from <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Buddha</span>, where if you give up on society, when you</br>   lose faith in humanity, is when humanity is lost. So that has always been</br>   something positive to me. So, every time I can help someone out or</br>   orientate someone, I try and do it. I try and do the best to change their</br>   minds and actually see them a different world where they were brought up,</br>   basically. So yeah. It was difficult.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So was it really the military that changed your view of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes. I lost my fiance in combat. She went MIA for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a month</span>. We</br>   didn’t know…I didn't know what was going on. We were about to get… we were</br>   engaged, and we were going to get married. And basically it's things that</br>   happen, that communication doesn't get to you fast enough. You really don't</br>   know what MIA? What's going on? They haven't had the count, then people</br>   lose communication, she was stationed somewhere else. And as fast as you go</br>   somewhere else, the files are sent, encryptions or whatever. And it takes a</br>   while. So, whenever it was declared, it was just like...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I mean, I lost my friends. I lost my best friend. And it was</br>   difficult to go through that process whenever you actually start losing</br>   brothers in arms because you live and you breathe and you bleed together.</br>   They're your front-line family. You really had to trust your man to your</br>   left and your man to your right. If you don't trust them, there's no trust,</br>   then there's no brotherhood.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And that is what was taught to us since day one. I mean, you've had</br>   to be the best you can be to join certain squadrons. But whenever that</br>   happened to her, which is…I just started doubting everything. I started</br>   reliving, how some friends have PTS, some friends are gone, their families</br>   didn't get enough pay. They got a very shitty compensation for losing</br>   somebody.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Then her as well, living my experience. As someone that was in</br>   there, you know what you signed up for, but you really don't expect it. And</br>   whenever things happen unexpected that change your life, that you actually</br>   want to keep living, or you actually want to keep fighting for. And there</br>   was a motto there that says that, &quot;It can either get you killed or can</br>   either make you live more.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So whenever that happened, I just broke down. Didn't know what to</br>   do. I tried to just stay there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a couple of months</span>. Everything</br>   kept reminding me about her, every time we spent. And since I wasn't really</br>   at home because of school and everything, she would travel with me. So she</br>   was the person that actually kept me sane.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And whenever that happened, I just kinda lost it. I didn't know</br>   where to go, what to do, what to think. Psychology teaches you that there's</br>   always a mid and a start point. The end point is when you're dead, but the</br>   mid can always reset. The start point can always jump to the mid without</br>   even any progression or anything going through it. So it was very difficult</br>   for me to actually leave the military because I left the military because</br>   of that decision too. And go to the real world and find out that there's</br>   nothing you can do in the real world, because basically they trained you to</br>   become a certain person. And there's not a lot of things you can do in the</br>   military, outside of civilian, besides being an officer or any kind of</br>   raising or anything that actually requires for tactical issues to be used</br>   in that society. And we were never taught to be businessmen. We were never</br>   taught to think as a different position. We were always taught to be</br>   analytic and decisions that would keep us alive and make sure that we got</br>   the job done.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So were you hoping that getting your degree would move you along to</br>   finding a position in society or was that-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I was hoping it would, but I really mainly did it because my</br>   childhood wasn't easy. My childhood was very tough as well. So the scars</br>   dumped me out whenever I finished everything. And I guess there was a part</br>   of me that we always want to travel. And so I did travel. I left the</br>   States. I started traveling. Didn't know where to go. So, best option was</br>   Mexico because my family and my friends were really worried. They were</br>   worried that I would go to any part of the world and be sucked up. I'd be</br>   giving an opportunity for someone to actually change my mind because at</br>   that moment I was very angry with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. So my friends would be</br>   thought that if I left anywhere to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Europe</span> or anywhere to China or stuff</br>   like that, that I could easily be given that BS working against the system,</br>   stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So a lot of my family voted. My friends also were very lenient for</br>   me to come to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> because I have family here that I haven't met since I</br>   was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years old</span>, I didn't even know them. So I decided to come here and I</br>   traveled Mexico when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got here, started meeting all the kind of</br>   family I had. And I decided to stay, I mean, I decided to say because it</br>   was closer to be with my niece and nephew. And it’s closer to my family,</br>   it’s closer to what I'm used to. I do go to visit sometimes, but right now</br>   it's just trying to find myself. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">The first year</span> I was here was very tough.</br>   When I let my family down and my friends down, I did everything imaginable</br>   that was not as a good person to do or what I was taught to do.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I use what I was taught to actually do bad things here. And after</br>   that, it was downhill until, people who love me came down and kinda set me</br>   straight. And they told me that my father-in-law really talked me into it</br>   and saying that I had to change because if I was still here it’s because I</br>   want to be, and I'm still here because I want to keep moving on. So I've</br>   been trying to move on slowly. I've been trying to set my life straight</br>   here. I guess all the rebellion that I was supposed to do when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span> or</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span>, I kind of redid it here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. And I just kind of learned that I</br>   had to do something a little bit different in my life and also in memory of</br>   my friends, in memory of her that I had to give myself an opportunity to</br>   actually give my true potential.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So I changed my life around here and I started working in different</br>   jobs and good jobs and always helping out anyone I can, if I can go ahead</br>   and shed some light, I always see kids in the street or people who come</br>   back from the States who want that thug life or who were in a thug life.</br>   Think about that mindset. Just tell him like, “Hey man, I don't talk like</br>   you. But trust me, I was just like you when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span>, I was just like when</br>   I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span>, it's not a way to go.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I mean if you want a family, you want a future, you just aspire to</br>   something better to be yourself and just get the opportunity to actually</br>   grow into something that was not drilled into you in your hood. That you</br>   are meant to be a doctor, scientist, lawyer, whatever you want to be.</br>   You're in the hood. You're driven to be a drug dealer, a drug addict, a</br>   drug hustler, swinging, doping, everything, gang banger. So most kids that</br>   come here are not orientated, or they don't have that guidance or they feel</br>   that they are man enough to handle the situation instead of actually</br>   analyzing their position and saying, I don't need to fight. I need to just</br>   become, do me, grow and actually make myself proud of yourself.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So that sounds wonderful. So what jobs do you have now that you're</br>   proud of?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Well, software engineer job is right now what I'm actually been</br>   doing. I've started a job thanks to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">HolaCode</span>, that is right now <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the</br>   good companies to work here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico city</span> is actually ranked amongst the</br>   top <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">10</span>. And it's awesome. They have a different culture mindset. They're</br>   not segregated. They have an open mindset of how you learn, how you adapt,</br>   who teaches you, who goes with you if you have a problem, they're always</br>   taking care of you. They're always asking you are you okay. Recently I got</br>   sick because of some of the food here and they were very understanding.</br>   They were like, you don't need to be here, go home. The code is going to be</br>   here. The work's going to be here, but if you're not okay, then we can't</br>   have you here because you can't work like this. You understand that you're</br>   not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">a hundred percent</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So just go home and recover and come back. And that was kinda like</br>   the best part, because some other jobs they really treat you like a slave.</br>   [Chuckles]. They tell you, “Oh you got to work.” Doesn't matter if you're</br>   sick or if you're sick, you can go to the medical institutions here in</br>   Mexico City but which are all horrible. And you lose more if you actually</br>   get sick, than you actually go to work. So that's the shitty society that</br>   we live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. But there's compensation when actually you start working</br>   for what you want, going and studying and actually doing courses that will</br>   give you an empowerment in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> society to let you know, “Hey, I am</br>   ready. I am able to do this job. And I'm just as qualified as anyone who</br>   actually did study here or actually does have a major here, and I can</br>   actually show it to you.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. That’s great. So when you came back, did you have a</br>   visa where you could go back and forth from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I'm a resident.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You're a resident of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you came back voluntarily because you were disillusioned with the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And when you came, you came to see family, you started with family?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah. Came for family. And also because I never really got to the</br>   vacations that I wanted. So I mean, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> has a lot of beaches, a lot of</br>   pretty beaches. So I would suppose I seen them too, so that’s nice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: But it was tough. The adjustment was tough because you were still</br>   mourning-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah. It was like, you're going to evolve a lot of bad decisions</br>   along the way. And the worst part is because I did not know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. I</br>   actually grew up in a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Spanish</span> household where that wasn't really used. It</br>   was always <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. So whenever that happened, I came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and I felt</br>   that I didn't have the social skills or the communication skills to</br>   actually interact with someone here. I would literally use my phone to</br>   actually show pictures or show the translator saying what I wanted, what I</br>   needed. So it was very tough. But the bad thing about it is that the good</br>   people that are here fortunately don't really know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and the bad</br>   people that are here do know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. So whenever you start walking around,</br>   start going around, started going sightseeing, you find that kind of</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> vibe there, and you start talking to them, I felt good because it</br>   sucked not to being able talk to somebody.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I really would just stare at people and try and learn their</br>   language and something that is my language that I'd never really learned.</br>   And those people who have spoken <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> were like, “Hey, it's another</br>   person who was lost, let's orientate him to our lifestyle.” So that's what</br>   happened there. And slowly but surely I started learning <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, started</br>   moving around. I didn't know how to move around because the government</br>   here, doesn't give you a lot of aid in letting you know what to do or where</br>   to go or how to do it, or actually translate the papers to you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Because I mean, everyone, if you ask around, you can get somewhere,</br>   but it also depends on the government as well to actually say, “Hey, there</br>   are some Mexicans that were never raised here, but there are from here and</br>   that need that translation in English to let them know what can we just do,</br>   how to do it and where to go and how much is it going to cost them and not</br>   get swayed into something that's not the correct way, or that you pay more</br>   for a document that's not supposed to be paid for, stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah. You get taken advantage of.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Exactly.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So how long did it take you to learn the language and pull yourself</br>   out of your grief and your bad decisions?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">A year and a half</span> it took me to actually change my life since I was</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And after that, then I started working on getting my documents,</br>   getting my papers. And it really did take me a year and a half to actually</br>   change who I had become in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. And I look back at myself and I feel</br>   disappointed because I had actually certain values, certain cultures,</br>   certain things that were taught to me. And that was shown to me also in the</br>   military that I should have not let the grief get the best of me, but</br>   sometimes, your mind just plays nasty little tricks on you, that you don't</br>   know what's going on, and you really want to escape what you were taught.</br>   You want to escape everything. You just want that pain to go away. You want</br>   that whole suffering of what's going on to just go away. I guess the easier</br>   decisions are always the hardest to come back out of them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So when you look back on your time in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, you were there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">20   years</span>, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">22</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">23</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">22</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">23 years</span>. You told me about the bad. Was there any good?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: School, friends, family. Best memories of me are always with my</br>   friends. I wasn't really close to my family. My family was very difficult</br>   to live with. The only reason I actually was a very good scholar was</br>   because my dad didn't like for us to come home with a B, he would say that</br>   he was laid off, he would work his ass off for us to actually learn</br>   something in school. And that a B is not worth it, that he wanted A's. So</br>   if we did get a B, it was a beating for sure. I'm not talking about the</br>   little slap on the wrist it was a real good beating.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: My mom was, she didn't have a lot of things to do. She's always</br>   been a hustler. So she always sold products to show up catalogs, stuff like</br>   that, like little household items. And she has always been very resentful</br>   that she came to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. And it's been very hard living with that</br>   person because she's always bitter. And that bitterness was always giving</br>   out, and beatings and yelling. So since I was little, I always try to stay</br>   away from home.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I started working since I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">11</span>, because I didn't want to stay</br>   home anymore. So I started finding my own way of money because my father</br>   taught me that if I wanted things I had to pay for it. So they would never</br>   give me allowance, they would never give me money, they would just only</br>   give me enough for the transportation. And when <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the New York</span> started giving</br>   the school aid, I mean, they didn't give me any more money, so they</br>   wouldn't give me anything. And after that, it was just very difficult to</br>   actually live with both of those types of people. When I grew older, my</br>   father was very scared of me because of what I had become. He knew that he</br>   couldn't push me around anymore. He knew that very clearly. And I let him</br>   know that too, because I was not very happy with him after seeing him after</br>   six years.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So he tried to impose that father authority. And I told him that,</br>   no, he lost the privilege. My mother also learned the hard way that she</br>   wasn't able to talk to me anymore the way she did when I was younger. And I</br>   went through every kind of thing imaginable by mom. My mom threw plates,</br>   tools, bamboo sticks, anything she could really get her hands on to make</br>   her point that she was not to be messed with. She even threw an iron at our</br>   heads once. I remember me and my brother ducking at that. So I guess all</br>   those memories and all those childhood relations actually made me very</br>   aware that…since very little that I was in here for myself, that I didn't</br>   count nobody.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And the beauty part was when I met my friends, friends that kinda</br>   had the same situations or were living the same lifestyles, we grew too</br>   close together. We were always working together or working to become</br>   better, working to get out of the hood, not become those kinds of children,</br>   prodigies of being a drug dealer or the gang bangers, stuff like that. So</br>   that was really cool. So we actually had this kind of friends and that was</br>   the best part growing up, but having to share that suffering with someone</br>   else, that's probably going through the same thing or differently, but in</br>   the same, we're all suffering. And out of that suffering, you make a unity</br>   and you make friendships. You make something bad good. And my best memories</br>   have always been playing, hanging with all my friends, parties with my</br>   friends, doing things with all my friends that have been my best memories.</br>   I have good memories of my family when we have reunions, but they're very</br>   little, but the best memories have always been that I can count on friends.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And are you still in contact with them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Oh yes. I'm still-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That is great. So when you look forward, I mean, you’ve had a tough</br>   life, a really tough life, and you know, the country where you grew up, you</br>   feel denied…you're disillusioned with that country. And you're now in a new</br>   country. What are your dreams for you now? What are your dreams?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: To become a good enough programmer to actually do a startup and get</br>   the opportunity that many people don't get. A lot of people are really</br>   smart here. A lot of people have the skills and mindsets to become a good</br>   businessman, a good teacher, stuff like that. So basically be able to</br>   contribute the same way. All the posts have been attributing to young minds</br>   to let them know that there's a different way to live life here. And that's</br>   actually what I want to do. I've always wanted to do that. In some little</br>   way, I've always tried to help someone find a job. Someone find a way to</br>   get things. So that's my idea.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: My dream and hope is to one day actually have a company that's</br>   actually ran with immigrants. Doesn't matter if they're deported, not</br>   deported or not even from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>, anyone who wants to come</br>   and work who has the time to show it because we're not the only country</br>   that's in mourning. Right now, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guatemala</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Argentina</span> are going through rough</br>   times; the economy is going through a very hard time and there's kids and</br>   people out there that actually are very smart.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Get the word out there that there are places in certain countries</br>   that are willing to invest in kids and willing to invest in certain</br>   futures. As long as you actually put the time in, put the effort, put the</br>   work in, and you actually show that you're committed to actually becoming</br>   something else and wants to change your life around. So my idea is to have</br>   a job or work environment that we can give that to those people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. It sounds like you have the capabilities and the drive</br>   to do it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you hope to have a family or do you have a family of your own?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: My guess somewhere in my head, I'm still hurt. I've had partners</br>   here, but I have never really committed myself. And my last relationship</br>   shed some light on that. It was very hard to hear the truth and to actually</br>   say, wow, you're right. Usually I'm never wrong. Usually I'm always the</br>   kind of person that is very analytic and chooses his battles that he knows</br>   he's going to win. And if I can't win that battle, I'll learn it and make</br>   sure I can win it. So whenever that happened, it was a little shot to the</br>   head, made me think. So right now, I don't want a family. I do strive on</br>   having a family one day. It is a dream of mine. But I guess I actually want</br>   to give myself time to become a better person, a better man, and actually</br>   first complete my training because I'm still studying, I'm still learning.</br>   So I want to be able to go ahead and have a good foundation on my job, that</br>   that foundation can go ahead and provide for something else and also</br>   provide for a family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is there anything that you would like to say—we're going to finish up</br>   now—but is there anything that you haven't covered that you would like to</br>   say to the people that will read this report about being a returning</br>   migrant?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I guess it's just really to open their minds, brain and horizons. I</br>   actually take the time to meet people, learn people because nowadays you</br>   see social media, people are stuck in social media. I mean, we don't have</br>   the good old times where people actually sit down and talk and actually</br>   meet and learn about each other, unless you're actually trying to become a</br>   partner or stuff like that. Even whenever you're going out with your</br>   friends, just talk, stop being on social media, stop posting pictures. Yes,</br>   pictures are going to last forever, but those memories are going to last</br>   longer. And I guess just to always keep an open mind and help people in</br>   need.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Great. well, thank you.</br> </br> &lt;div&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   Follow up on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">June 12, 2019</span></br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> &lt;/div&gt;</br> &lt;div&gt;</br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: This is <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span> and I am doing a follow-up survey with <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And thank you for coming.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: It's been crazy.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: This is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">our last hour</span> doing interviews so I'm so glad you're</br> here.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I know the guy downstairs told me, &quot;You're literally the last</br> guy we're going to...&quot; I'm like, &quot;Oh yes. Can you tell her that?&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, has <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the last year</span> been difficult?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Bumpy roads, on and off, yes. After we last met, after</br> graduation, from there getting a job was fairly easy-</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It was easy, good.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: But then after coding and I didn't feel it was my knack to do</br> that. I got it, I understood it, I understand the logical processes, I</br> know how to do it and know how to work it, I was actually a good</br> element in the job, but it just wasn't something that I was very</br> passionate about. And that's whenever I asked them about business</br> analyst and project management. They told me that from my previous</br> background experience I'll be a good fit, but since I was already a</br> developer, I couldn't jump.</br>   </br>   </br> Anne: So, in the company that you're working?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And I told him that, &quot;Well, I was here under the pretense that</br> you guys offer that, you guys offer growth and stuff like that.&quot; And</br> they're like, &quot;Yeah but we offer growth in your same sector. I mean,</br> you're a developer. If you want to grow to be a Senior Mid Architect or</br> something that will help you.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> Conversation briefly interrupted.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And so, decided to leave that company.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long were you there?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Six months</span>. I was there <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span>, but then someone corrupted</br> me. They're like, &quot;Hey, we can use a business analyst like you.&quot; And</br> I'm like, &quot;Ooh, I want to go.&quot; And like, &quot;Can you help me go there?&quot;</br> And he was a manager there. I'm like, &quot;Yeah, we'll try.&quot; And then when</br> we talked to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Human Resources</span>, they're like, &quot;Yeah, you can't switch</br> that fast. You have to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">at least a year</span> tenure here and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">that year</span> you</br> have to be here.&quot; And, since I was learning fast, I was getting jumped</br> into groups that were a lot more expert than me. So, I felt</br> overwhelmed. I'm like, &quot;Huh, I don't know what to do about that here.&quot;</br> Guys there were actually really cool, they taught me a lot of neat</br> tricks, coding methods, how to go ahead and process things better.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So, that was actually very helpful. After that, my mentor left</br> and I felt kinda bummed and I'm like, &quot;God damn he left. Like I'm</br> alone.&quot; I was still professional enough to go ahead and work and things</br> on my own. Then I started doing courses on Business Analyst and then a</br> company that we were working for saw my resume. And so I'm like, &quot;Hey,</br> you're a developer, but you're a project manager.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah.</br> Before I actually came into this, I was working other jobs, passing</br> back and forth. But my main focus is business analyst and project</br> management. But I've never really done that because most of the project</br> managements that I've gone through have been call centers. Requisitions</br> orders, where the client needs, innovations, critical thinking ideas,</br> expand the communications broad line, not really programming or</br> applications in technical industries. I'm not very familiar with that.</br> But, now that I'm a technical... Well I mean developer. I know those</br> things now, so I can go ahead and do that.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: They're like, &quot;Hey, you want a job?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Oh, what are</br> you offering?&quot; And he was like, &quot;Well, we'll take you away from them,</br> if they don't have a problem with that, because you signed a</br> confidentiality report. So, they don't put that in your face and you</br> can't work for me because we're technically partners.&quot; And I was like,</br> &quot;Oh, okay. Yeah, it works for me.&quot; So, told the company, &quot;Hey, thank</br> you. I'm leaving.&quot; And they're like, &quot;Why are you leaving?&quot; I was like,</br> &quot;Because I want to be a business analyst, project manager.&quot; I'm</br> thankful, all the code gave me what I need as a developer to understand</br> project management and technical concerns because project management</br> that I was only qualified for were call centers or things that they</br> didn't have to require technical savviness. They had to be</br> telecommunications and stuff like that.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: That is more media focal points instead of technical focal</br> points. So, they gave me what I need to go ahead and do that. So,</br> whenever I started working there, I've been with him for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven or eight months</span> with him already. And I ascended, I started off as a Junior</br> Project Manager, but their process was horrible. They didn't have a lot</br> of rules, they didn't have a lot of organizations, they didn't have a</br> lot of things set up in the programming. And I thought it was a</br> startup, but they mentioned to me that they have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about 20 years</span> or plus</br> presence. So, I was very shocked because the company that long in</br> trajectory should have things set up really good. So, whenever I</br> started doing an implementation, it's like, &quot;I have real faith in you.</br> You can go ahead and go what you feel like, just make sure the changes</br> you make, you go by me and so I can go on and have your back.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: Because, the CEO was skeptical. He was like, &quot;Why are we going</br> to get a programmer project manager then switch over?&quot; And they're</br> like, &quot;I have faith in the kid.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Oh, thanks.&quot; So, I decided</br> to prove the CEO wrong. And I started to make a lot of changes. So,</br> there's something called &quot;confluence&quot;, which is an article knowledge</br> base. Which is what clients and us use to know process, follow-ups,</br> skim designs, anything of sorts for the company, how it works and also</br> how they work too. I restructured my area, how procedures work, how</br> setups work, how support is going to be and how help desk is going to</br> be, how Q&amp;amp;A is going to be, how developers should work. After that,</br> it took me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about two months</span> to implement those changes. I made changes</br> to the team, started making more decision calls to get known.</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: CEO recognized what I was doing. Then he just gave me a project</br> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">last month</span>, until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this month</span> I'm doing it, creating a new platform for</br> ticketing system for them, because the one that we have currently is</br> not working properly or it's not fulfilling their needs with</br> customer-client relationship. So, I'm doing that one right now and it's</br> been bumpy ride. I'm kinda working all the time, going all over Mexico</br> City sometimes to visit clients, to take some ease off saying like,</br> &quot;Hey, what's going on? You have this problem.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;okay, so</br> let's get things straight. Yes, we have a bad trajectory of bad blood</br> between us, but I'm new. I'm here to make changes. And as you can see</br> from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three or four months</span> behind, changes have been made. And it's not</br> as fast as you hope, it's not as fast as you think money will buy, but</br> it's a process. And it's like us developing new applications, the same</br> thing as me creating things here. So, you have to understand that my</br> focal point is to go ahead and create things for us and you to become a</br> better partner and also a better business, because if they grow, I grow</br> and if I grow, you grow, you grow too.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, that's working well?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And do you like it?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes. Another company is trying to rob me.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: They're trying to rob you?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Well they're trying to take me with them.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, another company's trying to recruit you.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is that going to happen?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I don't know. They're actually getting to the price.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: They're giving you a good price?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Wow. Okay. That's great. That's amazing.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: It's actually helped me out. What I learned in military about</br> structure, being very stern. And something that's helping out with</br> clients is that I'm very firm in how decisions are made and how I talk</br> to them. Most of the project managers that have talked to clients, they</br> even told me that they don't understand the business itself. They don't</br> understand how things work. They don't understand business flow and</br> they don't understand how stakeholders actually worry about little</br> things that, like, &quot;It's my money.&quot; And I told him like, &quot;No, don't</br> worry, I know it's your money because that's how I get paid. And if I</br> don't get paid, I'm sad too.&quot; So, I'm very goal oriented. And in this</br> company, I never told them I was military, because usually whenever I</br> tell them that, they want me to travel because I have a visa to go</br> ahead and travel.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay. Internationally?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes-</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you don't want to travel?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: No, I don't want to travel.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I want to stay still, get something set up correctly. As far as</br> working, because before that it was hard for me to actually establish a</br> good job because of all my mental PTS that I had. That was very</br> unstable in certain jobs. I had very good jobs in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, but I kind of</br> blew them off because I just needed to escape certain things and</br> certain dates. The dates are the ones that killed me, certain things</br> that just remembered, a date in specific and I'm like, &quot;Oh wow, this</br> happened,&quot; and started just reminiscing. And that kind of blocked me</br> from actually achieving what I could be doing.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So, I've been actually... Not therapy on myself, but using what</br> I learned in college for psychology to actually understand what I need</br> to be doing, baby steps. I understand now that before all of that, I</br> was very goal orientated long-term. And I understand now that because</br> of all the trauma that I had, that those goals long-term, don't work</br> with me now anymore because I tend to lose track of that because of all</br> the things that are calming my brain sometimes.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So, I've been doing goals short-term. And that's been working a</br> lot more, and it's keeping me on point, focused. And I stayed away from</br> friends that all they do is party. So, I stayed away from friends like</br> that, and that's actually helped me out a lot.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. So, in terms of things that have been difficult</br> landing a job since you have been good, economic challenges, you're</br> sort of dealing with them, right?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I'm dealing with them.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You were saying that in terms of education, you were educating</br> yourself in terms of Business-</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: Analyst-</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Analyst. And that's probably online. Is that what you mean?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Since those courses are very expensive? I didn't know how</br> expensive they were. They're probably like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">80,000 Pesos</span> to just get a</br> course and-</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Right.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And then you have a certificate. So, it's just the course. So,</br> I started looking for online training for free, that probably just</br> showed me maybe three courses and started mashing courses together to</br> understand them better.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, because you're smart, so you'd do that.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So, that's actually... It was helping me out. And those</br> processes have actually helped me in my workplace because they told me</br> when I got hired, &quot;Do you know these processes?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;But</br> you have to have a certificate to back you up?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Honestly,</br> no. I'm going to tell you the truth. I've actually learned myself. I</br> have never went to a physical financial institution. Say pay for this</br> course, I'll get this course and I'll get it. Unfortunately I never had</br> that, but I can go ahead and learn it. If you guys pay for a course, I</br> can pass it because I've already done it myself.” I know how to work</br> the process. And I just did it. I guess I hustled it. And in the</br> internet, learning the tricks and knacks to downloading free books,</br> books that are maybe outdated, but that still work around here and just</br> interpret them differently now. That's how I learn.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. Yeah. How about socially? How's it been?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Still the same, very an social outcast.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: But you do that yourself?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: It's very hard to find people to not judge you. Or typically</br> all my friends that party or worked in call centers, they're like,</br> &quot;Why'd you leave <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>? Like, I don't understand it.&quot; And</br> sometimes it's hard to explain to people that way, because they don't</br> know how it feels passing through those types of dilemmas. Maybe they</br> have experience because they went to jail, because they gone through</br> this, and stuff like that. And I told them, &quot;That's your choice. You</br> made a decision. I didn't make my decisions to have friends die. I</br> didn't make my decisions to have my ex fiance die. None of that. That's</br> something that should happen. And you have to go through life and find</br> a way to live with it. It's not easy.&quot; So, something you got to</br> understand that you can't judge people just because you think it's</br> better on the other side, it's not.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And sometimes you got to understand what people suffered to</br> actually leave that to the other side. It's not the same thing. It's</br> like you hate <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and you hate <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. Which one are you</br> going to go for? And you hate both of them. You got to love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of</br> them, at least. And right now I love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I mean, even though</br> it's... Yes, it has a lot of flaws, government's horrible. I mean, now</br> it's a little bit better, but it's going around and same way, but it's</br> still something that you got to think important and find a lot of</br> people that think that way or comprehend it. And to the point where</br> they won't judge you, or they won't say like, &quot;Man, you should have</br> gone back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>. What are you doing over here?&quot; It's just</br> like, &quot;Hey, let me live my struggle.&quot; I mean, I've learned as a short</br> age that if you struggle here, you struggle everywhere. It just depends</br> on you if you want to get yourself out of it.</br>   </br>   </br> Anne: So, basically things have been better for you?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah. Job-wise, yes. Social, I'm still a social outcast and</br> have certain friends there. Money-wise, not so much because since I</br> don't have a formal academic diploma, it's something here that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br> is very stickler on. That they're very sticklers on, &quot;Hey, if you have</br> the paper, we'll pay you this much. If you don't have the paper, but</br> you have the experience, we'll pay this much.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Ah, but I</br> have experience more than what a person will have with paper.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And they don't look at your graduation from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">NYU</span> as something?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: No, because they say that it's not something that I use it on a</br> day to day. And with this employer, I proved them wrong. And I was</br> like, &quot;So, what do you think behavioral science does in my company?&quot;</br> Easy. How are you standing right now? The way you're standing is the</br> way you demonstrate how you want to go out and talk to someone. You</br> want to take them serious. You want to go in laid back. Right now,</br> you're trying to be laid back so you don't feel enforced, but whenever</br> you ask serious questions, you kind of tighten up. So, make sure you're</br> being understood correctly. And you want to be taken serious on a</br> question and you want a serious answer. So, that's how I know, because</br> whenever I go to a client, whenever I see agents, whenever I see my</br> coworkers, I know that their body behavior, how are they going to go</br> ahead and take and how they're reacting to what I'm telling them.</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: And also I let them know if something's going to change. I want</br> to know who is the person or who are the group that's going to not go</br> along with what I want to do. And I'm going to have problems there.</br> Before any hand, I got to watch these <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span>, because they're the ones</br> who didn't measure up to what I was trying to tell them in body</br> behavior. You don't have to actually say things to actually understand</br> what a person wants in the moment. I mean, sometimes it's just your</br> intuition, yes. But, it's really about science. You have to understand</br> that. And also the logical path of a neuroscience was letting you know,</br> &quot;Yes, this is wrong,&quot; &quot;Yes, this is correct,&quot; &quot;Yes, this is what I want</br> to hear.&quot; Or, &quot;Yes, this is a way to formulate a question without being</br> condescending or without being aggressive, without being persuading.</br> You're just being neutral.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: You have to understand in a company, when you talk to a woman,</br> you have to be neutral, but you have to be persuading to a certain</br> extent so they don't feel uncomfortable, but they feel that you're firm</br> and you know your stuff. So, a man you have to go ahead and show that</br> you're firm, you have to be persuading, you have to let them know</br> because unfortunately in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, there's a lot of people who think it's</br> a man's world. And you got to go ahead and cover up with them, even</br> though your moral say, &quot;No, it's kind of both ways.&quot; I mean, and a</br> little bit going on further, you're going to see a lot of women take</br> power. And when I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">HolaCode</span>, I liked that about that because</br> there's a lot of women in power saying they're doing things because</br> they want to do them.</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: They're the kind of feminists I do respect because they're not</br> just creating equality for people. They're just actually looking out</br> for humanity. Once we stop looking for humanity and helping each other</br> out, we've lost all humans inside of ourselves. So, that's what I like</br> about things to work it's way around. So, after I got done with the</br> interview and I was like, &quot;Have a proven myself, right?&quot; I mean, even</br> with my psychology, I know how to bullshit. Even without my psychology,</br> I don't know how to bullshit. So, I can go ahead and do a lot of things</br> with it. And it just really depends on how you use your knack for</br> things. And psychology has taught me a lot of things. So, it broadened</br> my horizons to people that they didn't know me, that want to know me</br> and sometimes it's just hard to understand people.</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: And I get people like that. So, whenever they talk about their</br> problems, I'm like, &quot;I get you.&quot; But, when I was talking about my</br> problems, sometimes it's different because they don't know that path of</br> how things are supposed to be and it’s not supposed to be their idea.</br> They have to be able to live in multiple worlds, ‘cause one world</br> doesn't govern everything, it’s multiple people who govern everything.</br> And they're not going to have the same mindset. So, you have to be</br> mature enough. And also my psychology helps me to understand that not</br> everyone's is going to think alike. And also to understand that not</br> everyone thinks alike you have to try twice as hard because you have to</br> make sure that if this guy thinks he wants money or this guy thinks he</br> wants growth, this guy thinks he wants something else. You got to unify</br> all of them, because you got to make sure that he's on the same page</br> and make sure they're coordinating each other. And that's what</br> psychology does as well, you get a knack for things like that. So, I am</br> good for the job.</br>   </br>   </br> Anne: Well, yeah, that's a really good explanation of it. And you know,</br> college in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> I think teaches you a lot about how to think through</br> problems and analyze problems, not just the psychologists, there's a</br> whole psychology education that goes with it.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: It has to do with you... <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">60%</span>, as you as a student, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">40</span> the</br> teacher, because the teacher... I've had teachers that inspired me.</br> I've had teachers that I didn't want to go to school because I had the</br> courses. But, thankfully I had teachers that actually always rooted for</br> me. I was a knucklehead when I was younger. So, all my teachers</br> actually were the ones who were getting on my case because they knew I</br> could have the potential.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's brilliant. So, tell me a little bit about the work, in</br> terms... This is part of the survey. How many hours do you work <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a week</span></br> or day... I mean, a lot? You can say <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a week</span>, you can say <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month</span>, I</br> don't know what-</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: A week, I probably work <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">about 90 hours</span>.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What is your earnings?

So, that would be like-</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">20,000 Mexican Pesos-</span></br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">A month</span>?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">A month</span>, yeah.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's a lot better than a Call Center, right?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: It is a lot better, but that's why I'm thinking of switching</br> sides, because yes it gave me opportunity, but they're not paying me</br> for what I'm doing and what they're asking for.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And this other company's…</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: They're actually recognizing, because when I talk to them,</br> they're like, &quot;Wow, you are experienced. You know a lot of things.&quot; And</br> whenever I had one recruiter tell me... And because he called, I think,</br> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about two weeks ago</span>, they like, &quot;Don't say how much you earn, double it</br> or triple it, because from what you know and what you're working, you</br> can get it. And right now, unfortunately I don't have a job position</br> that actually pays you that. I mean, I have a position that will pay</br> you maybe <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">15,000 Mexican Pesos</span> more. But I mean, from what you know,</br> it's yeah. And it's hard that you don't have a diploma that actually</br> respects from that people, but there's a lot of companies that will</br> respect you because of your intelligence, what you have, what you can</br> bring to the table.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, and what you can actually do.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, do you currently live with anyone or do you live alone?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I found roommates.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, friends?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you still have relatives in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yes.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you ever see them?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Mom and dad, no. Brother and sister, maybe sometimes.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you have relatives in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Grandparents?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Grandma, only.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you see her?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Try to every weekend. I try too.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you would never go to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> again?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Not to live. Probably if I have a job that makes me go back and</br> forth, I'd be fine with that. I mean, I have things set up there that</br> help me, now I won't start from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">zero</span>, but it's just something that…that</br> moral compass broke from there. Just saying that I can't look at it</br> again. There's a lot of people, police officers that whenever these</br> things happen, especially in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Florida</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>, a lot of police</br> officers are retired military. So, when that incident happened, they</br> told me that, &quot;We get what you're going through, but you have to push</br> through it. Each one pushes differently. And each one has a family that</br> will push them differently as well, or friends or something. But you</br> have to understand that if you stay here, you will have to live with</br> what you're caring for. And you're going to have to go ahead and</br> simulate it because you can't be a risk anybody else. So, you have to</br> understand that you joined for a reason.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: And whenever I joined, I did it in selfish reasons because I</br> want it to be a citizen. Because, that's kind of like the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span></br> dream, but it sucks that immigrants over there, even if you have good</br> schools, you didn't go in jail, you never went to juvie, are not</br> eligible to be a citizen over there, even though they're contributing</br> the right way. And the ones that are, not mean to be the bad word, but</br> the ones that are mess-ups are the ones who usually get away with</br> things there. And that's what broke through it. At the end of the day,</br> told my family that yes whatever I had accumulated that there from</br> goods, properties, things that I've paid for. It's just something that</br> comes and goes. You will always get something material, but you had to</br> be set to yourself and true to yourself.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: If you want to be a happy life, you got to know what you want</br> in life and go for it. Even though it takes you a long time, but you</br> have to at least keep sight of what makes you you. And being in the</br> United States doesn't make me me anymore. And I mean, after all that</br> bureaucrat shit, it just goes away with whatever you actually felt for</br> there. You're just like, &quot;Really? That's what the hell we're worth for</br> you. That's what you're going to go through? That how you throw away</br> our lives?&quot; And then there's people patriotically saying like, &quot;Yeah,</br> yeah.&quot; Because you probably never went through that and if you went</br> through that, you probably have a big moral standings wrong with that.</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: And if you are a veteran and you know things go through that,</br> those are the people that are like, &quot;Yeah, we get you, but shit happens</br> and this is our country.&quot; And unfortunately I was able to say, &quot;Yes,</br> this is my country because I was raised here, but I wasn't born here. I</br> can go to my country.&quot; So, that's what made me more [inaudible</br> 00:23:42] decide to come here. And also my family, because they felt</br> that I was going to be a wreck because my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> instinct was to go to</br> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Europe</span>. I have family in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">France</span> and in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Spain</span>. And they told me, &quot;Yeah,</br> we can set you up here.&quot; And my family was like, &quot;We don't trust them</br> because they're a family that we don't see very often. We don't know</br> how they are, what they do, who they are and what they're about. So</br> we've want you to go to your family, family. We want you to make sure</br> you're safe. And if later on in the world, later on in life, you feel</br> you're okay, then move over there, go. But right now you're not in a</br> mindset to be okay.&quot; And they're were right because when I got to</br> Mexico, I was not the brightest decisions that I've made here, but</br> those helped me actually aligned and take a lot of anger out that I've</br> had accumulated there and made me more calm.</br>   </br>   </br> Anne: Does the political climate in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> now make you feel</br> like you made the right decisions? Does it reinforce your decision or</br> does it... Do you just sort of-</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I feel sad that people forget how that country was built. They</br> forget the values, they forget something just because of hatred and</br> something they don't fully understand. And that's what's going on. It's</br> not even about things doing that. Politically, they have their reasons.</br> They have the power of money moves around with a lot of governments. A</br> lot of agencies all around the world want to go ahead and make someone</br> the scapegoat. And that's something that people are not talking about.</br> And when they talk about it, they get silenced. So, in a sense, yes,</br> I'm happy that I'm not there to live that because that would just break</br> my heart because of veterans that majority are minority, not even</br> immigrants or illegals, it's just are minorities, are the ones who</br> focus on creating the Armed Forces. And they're the ones kind of like</br> the backbone that gave them that power there.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And all of a sudden they're saying, &quot;Oh, you're not worth it.&quot;</br> For example, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> made an accusation—I'm guessing at Fox News</br> channel—that only gives soft questions to him. That veterans…that</br> they're not cut out for it. That if you have PST or something like</br> that, then you just weren't cut out to be in the military. And it's</br> just like, &quot;Wow. How can you say that? When you yourself, in your time,</br> when there was a draft, you actually faked an injury and there's record</br> of it and you still deny it.&quot; So, that's something that doesn't happen</br> quite often. I used to respect our presidents and the history that</br> military showed us, because it was something that you have to be part</br> of the military to understand what your orders are going to be.</br> Because, you got to understand that you're sending in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">thousands</span> of</br> troops into a country that are not all going to make it.</br>   </br>   </br> Joseph: And you have to make a decision saying, &quot;We're doing it for</br> them.&quot; Now it's just people doing it just for power. They're not even</br> doing it for the right reasons because when I was in there, you could</br> have easily taken out a lot of people, very fast, very swiftly. But,</br> there was always that power between money, greed and certain people in</br> power that wanted to do the right thing but weren't allowed to because</br> it was not seen correctly. I mean, whenever you do the extractions with</br> people, you knew where they were. You knew that if... And that can</br> guarantee you, patriots have gone in there, that whenever <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Bin Laden</span></br> happened, patriots themselves, they signed up to go on excursions and</br> say, &quot;We'll take them down, without no one else getting hurt. We'll</br> risk our lives.&quot; Knowing that they might die and that's the beauty part</br> of being in the military.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: You're willing to take that fight to them and if you succeed,</br> you take one down and you take them down good. And you make sure that</br> their organization understands that there are people willing to go</br> ahead and sacrifice themselves to go out for the better good of</br> everybody else. Which is what the military stands for. It's protection</br> for everyone that's not geared, not trained, not in that political</br> point of view. And everything that's going on right now, it just makes</br> me sad that they're giving military people not the credit enough they</br> deserve. And that they're saying that something that's horrible or</br> something that's different. I mean, there's a lot of people, activists,</br> there's a lot of pacifists, there's a lot of people who think the right</br> said that, &quot;Yes, sometimes we do need military action to go ahead and</br> share safety.&quot; But, that's because our culture has cultivated that.</br> Since the end of time, we've always resorted to violence. If there was</br> peace, had to be violence, if there was war to be won over, violence.</br> Everything was violence. So, it's hard to reset that mindset and say,</br> &quot;We don't need violence.&quot; Yes, you're probably right. We don't need</br> violence, but in this world and age, how are you going to make that</br> happen? We've been cultured for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">years</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">years</span>.</br>   </br>   </br> Anne: Violence solves war. So, it's violence, even in peace there's</br> violence. You're right.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: So, whenever that started happening, I am happy that I am done</br> with that. But, I am sad that there's still a lot of people that are</br> doing it for the right reasons and that don't get recognized. Even,</br> whenever you're a veteran. It's something that people don't understand.</br> It makes me sick whenever you see a veteran on the street. They fall</br> for something. And because we were probably... Saw a lot of things that</br> people shouldn't see. I mean, there's psychological studies showing</br> that if you expose a hundred people to death, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">80%</span> will be affected. If</br> you expose a hundred people on creating that death, all of them will be</br> affected. And they don't understand that we had to do orders, it's not,</br> &quot;Yes, we had a moral compass, yes, we're doing it.&quot; But our moral</br> compass was really jacked up for that patriotism saying, &quot;You're doing</br> it for the right reasons. You're killing for the right reasons. You're</br> losing your life for the right reasons.&quot;</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And you're thinking that blindly like, &quot;Yes I am.&quot; But,</br> whenever you start getting conscious of things, that's whenever you</br> make mistakes. And I know from frontline, if you make mistakes that</br> costs you your life. And unfortunately a lot of people... And it's</br> true, a lot of people who've been in the military for a long time, tell</br> you to not have a conscience. If you have a conscience, that little</br> second of doubt is a gunshot. It's something that happens. And I had a</br> conscience, but I just always stuck by the rules and what they told me</br> and that overlapped my conscience. It messed me up on what I had to do</br> to get through to objectives, missions, recons, measurements of what we</br> need to go ahead and task for certain people who were tagged. It's</br> something that doesn't have to happen to a lot of people.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And unfortunately, even though in the school, I was bright. I</br> was never the type of kid that would take nines and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">tens</span>. I was the</br> kind of kid that would slack and just get A's on the test without even</br> working on it. And when I joined the military, I saw that it was better</br> to be smart than to be tough, because it's tough people are the ones</br> who die faster than the smart ones.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I want to thank you for coming to talk to us again.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Pleasure.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It looks like you're doing well. And in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">another year</span>, if we see</br> you again, you'll be doing even better.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Hopefully. I wish to keep growing professionally. And hopefully</br> I'll be done with my debt. So, that's something that's also motivating</br> me.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think you'll ever start a family?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I want to, it's just-</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You're not ready?</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Yeah.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: I had a lot of partners tell me... This has been affected me in</br> relationships with why I don't want a kid. I know that if I have a</br> child, I would be over protective, but I wouldn't know how to handle</br> whatever I went through, whatever I've been through in the military. My</br> dad growing up, my mom growing up... There's evilness in everyone, it</br> just depends on how you take it up. And I just really don't want to be</br> that type of person that feels a certain way about having a child and I</br> want one. I'm scared of that evilness coming out again.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Not being that correct parent for whoever I might have a child</br> with. I do know that if I have a child, the first thing I want them to</br> do is to understand how things are working in world. And I understand</br> some people telling me that you should let a child have his innocence,</br> and it's fine. But, this is a certain limit nowadays, unfortunately,</br> that that innocence has to be molded differently because the times</br> change. We're not as secure as we once were back then. And</br> unfortunately, even in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, there's a lot of racism here and</br> something that you have to prepare your child for.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: And also there's a lot of violence around the world that just</br> because you're a certain color, you're a certain race or certain</br> something, or a certain intellect is different, you're criticized or</br> picked on. So, I do know that when I have a child or a daughter or son,</br> they're going to go ahead and learn to fight, be trained and have a</br> conscience that understands how things are nowadays. So, I do want one.</br> It's just that little part of my brain that tells me, are you even</br> ready? What if you let your evil part out and you mess that child's</br> life up? Like they did to yours. And if that [inaudible <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:34:52</span>] comes</br> around, I always thought of the idea of adopting. So, kind of there in</br> a little while maybe. If I don't have a partner, I'll do it myself.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Well I think just the fact that you're thinking through all this,</br> the evil will not come out.</br>   </br>   </br> <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joseph</span>: Hopefully. I wish that.</br>   </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
