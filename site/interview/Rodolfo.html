   interested in what was going on with me or my mother. She just wanted a<br>
   better quality of life for her and for myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: In Mexico at 16 years old, with no type of education past probably<br>
   middle school, she knew she wasn't gonna get very far. I guess she made<br>
   that decision in order to have a better quality of life for her and myself,<br>
   she went on. She was 16, and I don't know how she did it. I don't know the<br>
   details and all that, but she met the right people, or she got in contact<br>
   with the right people, and she went over there. She went to the United<br>
   States.</span> To this day, I still remember a lot of the things, even though I</br>   was very, very young. It's something that I always tell everybody that I</br>   meet, it's not just for this interview.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I always remember the bad things that happened or the very... I</br>   don't know if it's because it had such a big impact in my life and my</br>   mother's life or just because of how everything was set up. I remember</br>   everything that happened from start to finish. From the beginning where we</br>   got picked up, to being in the desert. I still remember eating cereal with</br>   water. It was... I don't know, it was very, very... I feel like it was...</br>   it obviously had an impact psychologically, because I still just have a lot</br>   of anxiety when I'm in certain places that I'm really accustomed to. A two,</br>   three year old in the middle of the desert, it definitely had to have an</br>   impact on me.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How old were you when that happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was two and a half years old, so that's why I'm saying it's very</br>   odd for me to be able to remember that at a very, very young age. It wasn't</br>   only that, just even when I was here, when I was two, two and a half, I</br>   used to remember asking my mom certain memories that I had. She would say,</br>   &quot;Oh you were one year old, one and a half years old, how did you remember</br>   that?&quot; It was always very, like a violent, violent memory that I had. It</br>   was more so like my father being drunk or high or whatever and coming in</br>   the house. Taking any little money my mom made for the week, in order for</br>   him to keep on doing what he was doing. Just coming in and just tearing up</br>   the place.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What's one of the first memories you have of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One of the very first memories I have of the US, was, I was in a</br>   truck with my mom—I'm not sure if this was before or after the fact, that</br>   we had already arrived because we arrived in Phoenix, Arizona—was somebody</br>   asking my mom, &quot;Have you and your son ate?&quot; I remember my mom telling him,</br>   &quot;No, but I have a sandwich here and some snacks for him.&quot; He went, &quot;No,</br>   here, you're in America now, you're in Phoenix now, let's go get a burger.&quot;</br>   I remember that somebody bought me—I don't know if it was her or him, the</br>   driver—a kid's meal from MacDonald's. This is when they had... I'm not</br>   sure…it was like the little hand-held games. I'm not sure, I think it was</br>   the Rug Rats or something like that. I remember getting that little toy and</br>   thinking, wow, it's a kid's... It had little fries and a burger, and you</br>   get a toy.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It was the first time I had ever saw that, and I got really happy,</br>   because I was playing the little game and all that. I thought that was the</br>   coolest thing in the world. After then, we went into a room... it couldn't</br>   have been more... It was just a standard living room, but there was</br>   probably like 50 or 60 people in there. Some of them were sitting and it</br>   smelled horrible. It obviously wasn't the best place. I guess it was just</br>   for people waiting for their relatives to go pick them up or something, I'm</br>   not sure. It was just my mother and I and I remember there was a lady with</br>   a big pot, and she was just cooking. I'm not sure what she was cooking but</br>   we went into another room and all I remember hearing was a big slam.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I looked back and it was a cage. It was literally like they</br>   fashioned a metal door with metal bars between the thresholds of the living</br>   room from end to end so nobody could get out. Then the windows were the</br>   same, they had burglar bars so nobody would get out. I was wondering, why</br>   is this happening? At that time, obviously, you were a kid, you don't</br>   understand what's going on. First I got fed, I have a little game, and now</br>   I'm in this steel cage that smells horrible. I remember somebody arguing</br>   with the other person that, &quot;The bucket was full. The bucket was full.&quot; I</br>   was hearing that, &quot;You need to empty out this bucket.&quot; I realized that was</br>   the bathroom, that's why it smelled so horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I remember the guy just closing a curtain, and just telling me to,</br>   &quot;Shut up.&quot; That's when I felt fear for the first time. Even though I was in</br>   the desert and everything, that's the very, very first time I felt genuine</br>   fear. I didn't know what was going on. I felt it because my mom felt it.</br>   She was just hugging me, and that was like the last thing I remember. After</br>   that I remember just waking up in the apartment complex. In a room, but it</br>   was completely different, it was somebody else. I guess these people knew</br>   my mother, because they spoke to her by name and everything. That was one</br>   of the very first memories.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What about school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: School? One of the first memories I have from school, after</br>   Phoenix—I wasn't going to school in Phoenix, actually, I think I even</br>   skipped kindergarten—we moved to Long Beach, California. And the only thing</br>   I remember from school was my mom waking me up probably about four or five</br>   in the morning. The sun wasn't even out yet, and she would walk me to this</br>   random lady's house. Actually, she wasn't random, but she was just some</br>   lady I didn't know. There was two other kids there, and I would be in</br>   uniform. That was the first time I actually wore a uniform to go to school.</br>   I was there, but I didn't really remember that much. When we moved to</br>   Chicago, that's when everything changed.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was a little bit older. I remember I went to Jordan Elementary.</br>   It was in the North side of Chicago. We were there for a very brief moment,</br>   because then we moved to Evanston. Evanston was literally right next to</br>   Chicago. The school I was attending was called Orrington Elementary. The</br>   reason why we moved, once again, is because she wanted a better quality of</br>   life for me. Where I was at, it was all English, there was no Spanish.</br>   Obviously, there were Hispanic kids who already spoke English, but there</br>   wasn't... She, herself didn't know English, so how could she teach me, so</br>   how could I be integrated into a school that doesn't even accommodate for</br>   individuals or kids who don't know English?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: She moved schools, although we were still in Chicago because we</br>   needed... what was it? Proof of residency. We lived out of district, and</br>   she would get fined or I wouldn't be able to go to school there. The point</br>   is I went to school to Orrington Elementary. The program was called the TWI</br>   (Two Way Immersion). It was a bilingual program and that's where I learned</br>   my English, that school. Friends and everything. I feel as though like,</br>   that's why I learned my English so well, because I really, really wanted to</br>   learn it. I always heard kids at the park or at the store, at Target, at</br>   Jewels, or whatever and everybody spoke English, right? I just felt</br>   fascinated, I was intrigued by it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It was a whole different language that I didn't know, and I wanted</br>   to master it. I wanted to be able to talk as they spoke, or talk as they</br>   talked. School was a very cool experience. I always had a lot of friends,</br>   and I was always the life of the classroom. I wasn't probably the best</br>   behaved kid, but I was always integrated in to what was going on with the</br>   school.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you remember any teachers or people?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, absolutely. Ms. Mule, Ms. Mule was my second or third grade</br>   teacher, I'm not sure which one it was. She was awesome, she always help me</br>   out with the English, always. Even in parent teacher conferences, she would</br>   literally always talk to my mom as if she'd be really interested. She would</br>   show genuine interest in what was going on with, not just me, but with the</br>   Hispanic kids. Kids who had trouble with English or weren't doing the best</br>   academically. She always would tell me, &quot;Don't worry, you're gonna get it.</br>   You're gonna learn it.&quot; She had such a big heart.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Still even, my mother and I still talk about the teacher to this</br>   point in time. She tells me, &quot;I remember Ms. Mule and she used to use hand</br>   gestures. She would always be like, 'Yeah, for this or for that.'&quot; Even</br>   though I knew I wasn't the smartest or the most best behaved kid, she would</br>   always have that initiative to get us there. Get us to that point. Yeah,</br>   that was one of my favorite teachers. Man, I value that so much actually</br>   now. I miss that teacher. Another teacher was in fifth grade, his name was</br>   Mr. Stoom. He was Argentinian, he was from Argentina. He was another great</br>   teacher. He always told us, &quot;Don't ever forget where you came from. Your</br>   roots are who you are, even though you all are coming from different parts</br>   of the world, don't ever forget who you are and where you come from.&quot;</br>   That's one of the biggest things right now, I'm kind of ashamed of.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm not, because I was so... What do they say, &quot;Americanized.&quot; In</br>   Chicago, I was so in America. I never dedicated the time to open a book or</br>   even Google something of my home country. Now that I get here, I don't know</br>   what is going on. Just barely a couple of months ago, I found out Mexico is</br>   a third-world country. I didn't know that. I go to Polanco Fendi, Prado,</br>   Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton boutiques. To me, that's not a third world</br>   country. Yeah, that teacher was the one who started opening my eyes up more</br>   to my surroundings.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Have you always known that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Have I always known that I was undocumented? When I was younger,</br>   when my mother and I arrived to Chicago, I remember my aunts telling her,</br>   &quot;Don't go out that much. Stay indoors, because if they see you, they can</br>   take you.&quot; I'm at a very young age, at that point, I think I was six or</br>   seven. Adults are talking in the room and you hear them tell your mom,</br>   &quot;Don't go out that much. If they see you out there, they're gonna grab</br>   you.&quot; I thought like, “Whoa, who's gonna grab us, who's gonna grab mom?” I</br>   didn't understand the concept of the legal side of migration. Why we're not</br>   supposed to be here. I'd never quite fully understood why I wasn't supposed</br>   to be there.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Until finally, one time my stepdad, he told me, &quot;You need to go to</br>   school and do everything that you need to do, because we're not supposed to</br>   be here.&quot; I asked him, &quot;Why not, why can't we be here?&quot; He told me, &quot;We're</br>   immigrants, we come from a different country. You weren't born here, I</br>   wasn't born here, and this isn't our country. People don't want us here</br>   because they say we take their jobs. Or they have a preconceived image of</br>   what an immigrant is.&quot; I still didn't understand it yet, I didn't know why.</br>   You go to work, you pay your taxes, you do everything as my American</br>   parent's friends do.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Everybody... I go to their house and, yeah, they have big ‘ol</br>   houses and mansions and stuff like that, but at the end of the day, they go</br>   to work, they have a job. I don't see you out here stealing or doing</br>   anything, you're not causing any harm. Why can't we be here? He told us,</br>   &quot;Well, I mean, that's just the way things are.&quot; I didn't understand that</br>   until obviously I grew up and then I found that out. When I finally really,</br>   really understood what an immigrant was or why I was an immigrant, it was</br>   the day that—I was in a debate team in my middle school. We won, in the</br>   whole district we won. We won the top prize. We went... Not national, I</br>   think it was... Yeah, nationwide, we were supposed to go to DC.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: We were supposed to go to DC. I remember this then and it broke my</br>   heart, so I want to even cry now [Emotional]. Damn. I asked my mom, &quot;Can I</br>   go?&quot; She's like, &quot;No you can't.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because you can't fly.&quot;</br>   I'm like, &quot;Why can't I fly?&quot; She said, &quot;Because you don't have a state ID,</br>   you're not from here.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Damn.&quot; Then, I think she told the</br>   school... She made something up, but that's when I finally knew it. Like,</br>   &quot;Damn, this shit is real, this is real.&quot; Then after that I just, &quot;Okay,</br>   whatever, I'm just gonna see where this takes us.&quot; Yeah, that's around the</br>   time I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you ever work in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I worked all the time, I never stopped. One of the first</br>   jobs I had…My uncle worked at a restaurant called, Baker's Square in</br>   Chicago. It was on the corner of Tui and Pratt. I really, really, really</br>   wanted—I think I was in fifth or sixth grade—a phone. I wanted a phone,</br>   it’s called the Psychic Slide. Phones used to flip, but this one slides. I</br>   wasn't gonna ask my mom for it, so I asked my uncle. &quot;Hey man, I know you</br>   work at Baker's Square and I know around the holiday season it gets really</br>   busy. Can I help you? Can I go?&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, yeah, if you want.&quot; I</br>   used to wake up like 3:00 in the morning, and I used to go and help him</br>   out. After that, I really liked making money and I really liked dressing</br>   nice, I liked having my nice haircut or whatever. My very, very first job</br>   was in Wilmette, Illinois. I was a caddie. Yeah, and then—</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: On the golf course?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: On the golf course, yeah. Wilmette Golf Course actually. I</br>   remember I was always the first one there. They used to choose us, when</br>   everybody got there, &quot;Okay, you come with me, you come with me.&quot; I used to</br>   always go there and there was a gentleman by the name of... Man, I forgot</br>   his name. Like the President, Gerald Ford, that was his name Gerald Ford!</br>   The only reason I remembered was because of the President. He used to</br>   always get there around the same time I got there. He finally asked me, &quot;Do</br>   you want to be my personal caddie? I don't want you working anymore with</br>   all these other kids, because nobody wants to work. Do you want to be my</br>   personal caddie?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, absolutely.&quot; It was going really, really</br>   well and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I got to high school, I had a number of jobs. I worked at Subway,</br>   I worked at Chili's, I worked at... What was it? Outback Steak House, but</br>   then I finally just got to the Cheesecake Factory, and that's where I</br>   stayed the remainder of my time. The remainder of my time I stayed there,</br>   and I started from the busboy and I finally ended up being a bartender. One</br>   of the head bartenders, one of the head servers, they used to pay-out</br>   people and everything. Obviously, I didn't have my social or anything, but</br>   I was a little bit older than what I really was. When I first got there,</br>   when I first, first started working I think I was like 14. Obviously you</br>   can't work that young, I think actually, I was 18, at 14.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I didn't see it as anything bad. I knew that if I got caught with</br>   my fake ID and my fake social security card I'd get in trouble, but that's</br>   why we're there, that's why we worked. I didn't get a fake ID to go party</br>   or go get into clubs or bars or anything. The main purpose of it was for me</br>   to be able to get a job, and so my mom wouldn't have to work all those</br>   hours that she used to work. She used to work at a Burger King, overnight.</br>   I used to barely see her, and I didn't want that anymore. I told her, &quot;You</br>   don't have to work that much if I start working. We can help each other</br>   out, we can, we're a team.” It was only my mother and I until I turned 14,</br>   when she met my stepdad. All throughout that, it was just my mother and I.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: After your mom told you couldn't go on that trip, how did that</br>   affect the way you were involved in school, the things you wanted to do,</br>   did that change? Is there anything that you...?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I didn't put as much effort as I did anymore. I knew, at the end</br>   of the day, I'm not eligible for scholarships. I don't get any aid, I don't</br>   get anything. In my mind I thought, “Man, what's the point of really</br>   working hard in school if at the end of the day, I'm not gonna get any</br>   help?” My mom is having to work to put me through college. No, I don't want</br>   this, so I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna give her what she</br>   wants, my diploma, my high school diploma. From then on, if I want to do</br>   something, it'll be by my own hand, out of my own pocket. I didn't want her</br>   to... Not that I was a burden or anything, my objective was for her not to</br>   work that much. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: After she told me that, I'm like, &quot;Well, okay, what's the point of</br>   really working hard and putting your best effort into school if, in my</br>   position, I won't be able to surpass US citizens.&quot; Then the aspect of</br>   financial aid, or any aid at all, I'm not gonna have any of that. I tried</br>   it with the fake social, but obviously it didn't go through. Nothing</br>   happened. Yeah, it changed a lot. It changed the way I viewed everything</br>   around me. Like, spring break all my friends would go certain places out of</br>   the country, and I used to get invited and, &quot;No, I can't go man, my family</br>   doesn't think...&quot; It would always have to be lie after lie after lie. I</br>   didn't want to... for one, I always had that idea of like my mom and my</br>   family always told me, &quot;Don't ever tell anybody you're an immigrant. If</br>   somebody has that knowledge they can do you harm. They can take you away</br>   from here, they can take us away from each other.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm seeing it now, with the families going across the border, and</br>   them being separated. I didn't understand it at the time, and man, now I do</br>   understand it. I didn't know how it really was until I finally got put in</br>   handcuffs and got shipped to an immigration facility.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What do you think you would have wanted or end up being before you</br>   found out? What kind of things... Like you were on debate team that was—</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I wanted to be a lawyer, man, that's what I wanted to be. That's</br>   what I wanted to be, a lawyer. It's funny, because when I was younger I</br>   wanted to be a lawyer. Then after that I'm like, &quot;I want to be an</br>   immigration lawyer, that's what I want to be now. I want to be an</br>   immigration lawyer.” I was already on the right track to being a lawyer,</br>   but then when that happened, it really opened my eyes more to, &quot;Okay, let's</br>   help my people.&quot; I didn't realize... I know individuals over there who are</br>   citizens, and they're panhandling because they want to. They're on their</br>   own addiction or for whatever reason right? Or people who are just living</br>   off the government, but then I see some of my family members, or my</br>   friends’ family members and they're not citizens but they have businesses.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They have a business, they have trucks, they have houses, they're</br>   great. They're not living off the Government, they're not asking for a</br>   handout. They're living better than what a citizen is living. It's all</br>   about how much work you put in, right? If you hang around people who don't</br>   want to do anything, then you're not gonna do anything. I remember Gerald</br>   Ford always told me that. He was like, &quot;If you want to be a millionaire,</br>   hang around millionaires. If you want to be successful, hang around people</br>   who do successful things, but if you want to keep doing what you're doing,</br>   and just be a little caddie or whatever, stay here. Stay here and maybe one</br>   day you'll do something else.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: He was very blunt in that aspect like, &quot;Always do a good job. I</br>   don't care if you're a shit-shoveler, you're gonna be the best shit</br>   shoveler there is.” That always stuck to me, that's why whatever I do, it's</br>   always been 100%.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Can I speak? I'm Anita, I'm the director of this project.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm really pleased to meet you—</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Likewise.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm amazed at your incredible story. When you talked about the trip</br>   to DC, the debate club, and you got very sad—</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... what made you sad, and did it make you feeling... Do you</br>   remember what your feelings were as you sort of found that all these</br>   options were gone to you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Well, it was just mixed emotions. I felt sad because I contributed</br>   to the team a lot. I wasn't just there, and it made me sad because I wasn't</br>   going to be able be with my friends, my teammates. It also made me mad</br>   because all my life, all my short period, my whole time here in Chicago or</br>   whatever, I don't think I've done anything bad. Why shouldn't I have the</br>   privilege to go if I put in the same work as they did? Only because I don't</br>   have a social security number or a document that lets me buy a plane ticket</br>   and go over there? I think about it in a different—at the same time, I was</br>   a little kid too—I just cried a lot. That night I just cried a lot because</br>   I knew I wasn't gonna go. My mom spoke to the, I'm not sure what my mom</br>   told her, but see, I don't think she told her that we're undocumented, and</br>   I can't fly.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I just remember that night feeling very sad, very sad, but</br>   then it turned into anger. It was like, &quot;Man, why can't I?&quot; It was always</br>   just that, &quot;Why can't I? I put in the same work, and just because I wasn't</br>   born here, I can't fly?&quot; I even looked into bus routes and everything to DC</br>   and stuff like that, but my mom was like, &quot;No, you're crazy, you can't go</br>   alone.&quot; She worked and everything, I just felt sad, mostly sad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did Gerald Ford know you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: No, Gerald Ford didn't know I was undocumented, no. I was still</br>   very young at that point. My mother and my family always told me, &quot;Don't</br>   let anybody know you're undocumented.” If somebody finds out, for whatever</br>   reason, there's some people who just are plain out racist or don't want</br>   people like me in the States. Sometimes they just do things to... I don't</br>   know. That's what I understood and that's what I took in and that's what I</br>   applied to my life. It's like living a secret, it was like living a second</br>   life or whatever. It’s like, &quot;Oh shit, why do I have to lie, why?&quot; I guess</br>   it's neither here nor there now, right? I'm here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That must have been incredibly difficult. I know personally, because</br>   I've had to keep secrets.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I guess it's one of those things where you think it's never</br>   really gonna affect you, until you're in the back of the DHS, the</br>   Department of Homeland Security, van. You're next to a whole bunch of</br>   people you never met, and they're also in the same position. Some don't</br>   even speak English. You don't really understand how immediately it can</br>   affect you until it affects you. I never thought it would affect me. Okay,</br>   well I mean, I'm working, I'm going to school—I'm in high school—I'm doing</br>   this, this and that. Some of my friends who are students already dropped</br>   out. Did everything, they’ve already gone to prison and back and</br>   everything, and they haven't even hit their 21st birthday.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I'm still good, I'm still good. I may not be a straight A</br>   student or anything, but hey man, I'm still here! Why can't I have the same</br>   privilege as you all do? Why can't I get my license? You know how happy I</br>   was when I got my license here, damn. I love to drive, that's one of my</br>   passions. Always, always, always I love to drive. I couldn't get my license</br>   over there. I remember even in high school in drivers ed, I knew what the</br>   answer was, but I asked my mom, “Hey mom, can I apply for drivers ed, so I</br>   can get my license? “She was like, &quot;You know you can't get your license.&quot;</br>   Again, one of the primary things, I’m like damn, I'm just not gonna be able</br>   to drive all my life? Or if I do drive and I get pulled over—as a matter of</br>   fact, that's the reason why I got deported, driving without a valid drivers</br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I never got why the paper said, &quot;Driving on a suspended license.&quot;</br>   I would always ask them, &quot;If I don't have a license, why is it suspended?&quot;</br>   They just told me, &quot;Because you have a drivers license number, but you</br>   don't have a drivers license? I'm like, &quot;Okay, so if I have a drivers</br>   license number, why can't I get my drivers license?&quot; &quot;You don't have the</br>   proper documentation.&quot; I'm like, &quot;But I have my...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One day I thought, “Well why don't I just grab the driver license</br>   number and have somebody make me a fake drivers license, and put the</br>   drivers license on there?” But see, if I get caught with it, now I'm in</br>   more trouble, and now I'm seen as a real criminal, because now I'm going</br>   around the system once again. That's why we don't want you here, because</br>   you're gonna do things like that. [Exhale] I haven't talked about this in a</br>   while. It just makes me want to…I don’t know.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You know that was different from a lot of other people in high</br>   school probably too.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, it was a big difference for my friends and I, because they</br>   all got their license, they all were able to get their ID and everything.</br>   And I wasn't able to do it. Then when I was asked, &quot;Hey man, why don't you</br>   get your license?&quot; Only some of my very, very close friends—probably like</br>   two friends—knew that I wasn't documented. Then, when we spoke about it</br>   amongst other friends, they knew that it was like another secret you had to</br>   keep. Yeah, it was different with other kid. Sometimes I'll be even</br>   jealous, because I'm like, &quot;Damn, if only I had been born a couple of miles</br>   North of the border, or West of the border, or whatever, I could be in your</br>   position.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm like, &quot;Why, why do I have to feel that way man? I'm a good</br>   person. I've made mistakes and things like that but hey man...” Nah, don't</br>   think that way you know? Just because you don't have a visa that says</br>   you're from America, doesn’t mean you can't do the same things. What, at 15</br>   I bought my first car by myself. At 16, I got my first ticket, my first</br>   pull over. But why? Because I was coming home from work. That's when I was</br>   already working at Chili's—I was working in Schofield, Illinois at Chili's.</br>   You know restaurant jobs, you got to work late. At that time in the</br>   suburbs, there's not much transportation short of a cab ride. But I'm not</br>   gonna be wasting money every day, so that's why I bought my car.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: That's what happened, that's really why they got me. I remember</br>   when I was in Court they said, &quot;He has accumulated since he was 15. Since</br>   he was 15 he accumulated a lot of driving tickets. He is dangerous to the</br>   road.&quot; I'm like, &quot;What? [Incredulous]. All my tickets are because you guys</br>   pull me over. It was late at night, I was the only car on the road. I mean,</br>   obviously, if a police officer tails you for more than two miles, you're</br>   gonna do something wrong in their eyes, right?” That's just what happened.</br>   I kept on driving, why? Because I went to school and I went to work, and</br>   it's just easier, it's just more convenient to drive your car that you paid</br>   for, than to go through the hassle of the CTA—the CTA is the Chicago</br>   Transit Authority.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, that's the way it was, but I always saw it as, “Man, don't</br>   let that affect you.” But, hey man, it affected me all right? If I didn't</br>   drive, I would probably still be over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did they give you tickets for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Driving with no valid drivers license. Then after two or three</br>   time it turns into an aggravated... No, sorry, it turns into a felony. It's</br>   just the same kind, but now it's a felony instead of a misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They just pulled you over because they saw that... Why did they pull</br>   you over?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One of the first times was because I had a busted taillight. I</br>   didn't realize that the lightbulb had gone out. Then after that...Once</br>   again, I didn't live in the best place around town, so police would always</br>   be around. I guess they just saw me and they would always just get behind</br>   me. It wasn't just me, it was other friends. Even when I would be with</br>   other coworkers, it would happen the same way. In Rogers Park, by Evanston,</br>   and even in Wrigleyville, a whole bunch of places, if it's late at night</br>   and they just see one or two individuals, especially Hispanic or</br>   African-American, they're gonna see what's going on.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They're gonna want to see what's going on. That's what happened,</br>   because I literally would ask them, &quot;Why did you pull me over?&quot; &quot;Improper</br>   lane usage.&quot; All my tickets improper lane usage, failed to use turn signal.</br>   It was really aggravating because it was like, “Man bro, you see me with my</br>   work uniform on, you see the food right next to me. Literally, here is my</br>   work ID, this is where I work, and I'm coming from work. Please just let me</br>   go home.&quot; &quot;Please step out of the car.&quot; Impound the car, or, I'm not gonna</br>   lie, some of the times that I did get pulled over sometimes they just let</br>   me leave the car, or they had me call somebody with a license, but that was</br>   very, very rare that would happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of those occasions immigration never picked, and never gave them to</br>   them... Chicago's a sanctuary city.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: No, Chicago's a sanctuary city, yeah. That's why I don't</br>   understand why I was picked up. The day I got picked up, I was driving to</br>   work. I parked my car and out of nowhere a Ford truck, it was unmarked</br>   truck, they didn't even have the DHS seal on it. I didn't understand it,</br>   because I even told them all, &quot;Isn't this a sanctuary city? Can you guys do</br>   this, is this against my Constitutional rights? I'm not that sure, not that</br>   well-educated in that aspect of it, but here, give me a book, I'll read it</br>   and I'll tell you what it is. I'm not stupid bro.&quot; That's why they</br>   separated me from the other people I was with, because it wasn't only</br>   Mexicans that I was with. I was with somebody from... I was with two</br>   Somalians.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They were brothers actually, two Somalians. I told everybody,</br>   &quot;Man, don't sign anything, don't talk, don't say anything. Just tell them</br>   you want a lawyer and that's it.” I remember they told me, &quot;Shut up,&quot; and</br>   they put me in a different cell, because I kept on telling everybody not to</br>   sign anything. Yeah, that's what I didn't understand—I didn't understand</br>   how they were able to go get me, but as I understood then and now,</br>   obviously federal laws are always gonna trump state laws. That's in the</br>   door, that's why you still see the dispensary in Colorado get raided,</br>   because it's a federal offense, and not state offense. I was literally a</br>   federal walking broken law.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's sad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: That's the way I saw it. Even though I'm cool, I'm all right and</br>   in Chicago, a sanctuary, but that's only state. They can come and just tear</br>   the place up into whatever they want because they're the government. And we</br>   can't do anything about it because I'm not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm gonna have to go in another room, can we pause for a second?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, after you were detained, how was your experience? What</br>   happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: After I was detained, I've got to say my experience going through</br>   the immigration, it was something I had never experienced in my life. I</br>   mean, I was never deprived of my freedom. And it wasn't because I committed</br>   an actual crime. I didn't go and take somebody's laptop, or I didn't go</br>   into a store with a loaded gun and ask for money. No, it was one of the</br>   most horrible experiences I've ever been through. It was more their idea of</br>   housing me because I'm not from there or it was...</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: [Pause]. I remember when I first got picked up, they took me to</br>   Wisconsin—I'm sorry, they took me to Rock Island, Illinois—for processing.</br>   That was the processing center.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They took my fingerprint and my name, first and last name and</br>   everything. Right? So I wasn't… I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. They</br>   took my name and everything, right? But then they had a form in front of me</br>   and they told me here, sign here and you know you'll be all set. And I</br>   asked them, “Well here, give me a second, let me read it.” And there was</br>   another person, right? Because it was a desk like this one. It was four</br>   seats this way with the divider being the computer, the fingerprint scanner</br>   and a camera, like a little Nikon camera, simple camera. And I told</br>   everybody— I was the only one who spoke English or perfect English at</br>   that—&quot;Hey man, don't sign anything at all until you know what you're</br>   signing because you don't know what you're signing. For all you know you're</br>   signing your liver away. So, just don't sign anything.” And the guy told</br>   me, “Hey man, shut your mouth. We're talking to you; we're not talking to</br>   them. I'm talking to you. Don't be a hero or don't be a jailhouse lawyer.”</br>   I'm like, “A jailhouse lawyer? I'm not in jail.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And they told me, “Just sign here.” I'm like, “No, I'm not going</br>   to sign it.” And I started reading through it, and it basically everything</br>   that it said was, “I waive my right to an appeal. I waive my right to any</br>   formal hearing. Basically, deport me as soon as possible.” And I'm like,</br>   “So you're telling me that without explaining to me what's going on or what</br>   this form entails, you're just going to have me sign it?”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Because they told me, “We're not going to let you speak to your</br>   family and you're not going to see your family for a long time if you don't</br>   sign this because you're breaking some law or whatever.” Because they even</br>   showed me little papers saying, if you state that you're a US citizen it's</br>   a federal crime punishable by between—I think it was like—three to seven</br>   years in federal prison.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Now, I'm not sure if that was another one of their little tactics</br>   or whatever, but nonetheless didn't let it scare me, I didn't let it affect</br>   me. I'm like, “Okay cool, that's great man, I'm not going to sign this. I</br>   need to go in front of a proper hearing and a judge. I want to bond set.</br>   Because I know, well, I may not know my rights a hundred percent, but I</br>   know that I'm, I'm entitled to a bond or at least a hearing for a bond.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And they told me, “Wait right here.” And then they went to go get</br>   a supervisor, and the supervisor spoke to me in private and he gave me</br>   another form and he was like, “Okay, you want a proper hearing? Sign here.”</br>   And I read it and, okay here, then like, man, this is what it is? It took</br>   me getting loud with you. I was a bit belligerent, I'm not going to lie to</br>   you tell you I was the best, as they called me, “detainee.” But I'm going</br>   to fight for my home. I understand I was born in Mexico, but Chicago's my</br>   home, it's my land, that's where I'm from. And whatever I can do to stay</br>   there, I'd be okay.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And so, yeah, that's what it was. But it took me probably a good,</br>   five months before I could see a judge.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were in detention that whole time?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was in detention. I was in a detention center for five months.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Before seeing the judge?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Before seeing the judge. And it wasn't even a formal hearing I</br>   did. It was over the internet and the monitors, surprisingly that day, did</br>   not work. So, all I heard was voices and I told them “No, I want a proper</br>   hearing. I can't see the judge. For all I know there's a guy in the next</br>   room talking to me and there's no judge.” “Okay, well you're going to have</br>   to wait on a whole another six months.” And I'm not going to lie to you,</br>   those detention centers aren't all that pretty, you know what I mean?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I just didn't want to be locked up anymore. That, honestly, that</br>   scared me. I didn't want to do another whole six months. By that point, I</br>   would've done a year just to go see one judge for a bond. Finally, I said,</br>   “Yeah, you know what? Yeah, I want one. I'll take the six months, give me</br>   the six months. Just so I can see a judge.” Surprisingly, there was another</br>   court hearing, I think, a month from then. So, I finally got to see the</br>   judge, but they set the bond at $50,000. And I don't have a $50,000, my</br>   family doesn't have $50,000. So, I sat there. I sat the two and a half</br>   years because I wanted to fight it. Every possible angle that I could</br>   probably touch, I tried it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm a victim of sexual abuse in the United States and there was a</br>   police report made and everything. And I've also been a victim of gang</br>   violence. I was never, you can check my background and everything. I was</br>   never into gangs or anything, but around the area I lived in there was a</br>   bunch of gangs and... I was beat up two or three times bad just by walking</br>   home. And it was all documented, I had police reports and everything. And</br>   because of that I was in therapy for while. My mother sought out a help</br>   from a psychiatrist because of the sexual abuse I had as a child in</br>   California, as a matter of fact.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I took Risperdal and a Ritalin, Risperdal for the anxiety and the</br>   Ritalin and for the ADHD. So, we tried everything. The mental health side,</br>   the mental health asylum, everything. But it was just going to take longer</br>   and longer and longer and I was tired of it. I didn't want to be locked up</br>   anymore. So, finally I just told my mom, “You know what man, that's it, I'm</br>   done. I don't want to do this anymore.” She asked me, “Is this what you</br>   want to do?” And I told her, “Yeah.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: She told me, “You know what? I'd much rather see you over there</br>   and be free then not being able to see you here at all.” Because there was</br>   a lot of people that went to go visit their loved ones and they used to get</br>   picked up. Sometimes they wouldn't even let you see your loved ones and</br>   right away ask you for your identification, your social security card, your</br>   nationality and everything and they would get picked up.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I always told my mom, “Don't ever come visit me. Don't ever</br>   come visit me because if you do, chances are they're going to take you</br>   too.” And you know, that would always break my heart because I would want</br>   to see my mom. I'd want to see my dad and everything, but I wasn't able to.</br>   So, that experience was just horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When you were in the detention center what were the conditions? Did</br>   you have access the medicine you needed? Did you have access to food and</br>   water?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: The company that made the jail was called GEO Corp and they were</br>   actually, I'm not going to lie to you, they actually were pretty good,</br>   health-wise, not so much security-wise. A lot of things would happen in</br>   there that definitely shouldn't have ever happened. But with the food and</br>   everything, it was good. In my opinion it was because of the company. I</br>   feel as though if it was up to the government... Thank God it was an</br>   independent company that was hired by DHS as opposed to if DHS were to make</br>   their own jail, I feel they would be completely different.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It was [Pause] a pleasantly... there's no way to describe it, it</br>   was bad. It was bad, but for what it was I guess it was okay. I don't see</br>   there being an in-between or any pretty way to paint that picture as to how</br>   good or bad it was in there. Because at the end of the day you're deprived</br>   of your freedom. You can't just pick up the phone whenever you want and</br>   call your loved ones because you've got to pay for that too. You got pay</br>   for that. And if you want to take a shower, you have to buy your soap,</br>   right? You've got to buy it yourself, you've got to buy everything. And now</br>   you're becoming a liability for your family, you're becoming another bill.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: You're becoming another bill and that's what I didn't want. So,</br>   that's why I started working. And now, older, I'm becoming another bill.</br>   So, I don't get it. You're taking us away from the jobs that we have and</br>   everything. You know? So, take us back to our country. And I'm not sure if</br>   it this is a fact or not, but I was reading when I first got in here, there</br>   was a time where there wasn't enough field workers for, I think,</br>   avocado—or, not avocado, I think it was oranges or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I remember me saying, “Well, there goes all the deportees.</br>   There goes all the people you guys deported. Where are the people that were</br>   so outraged because we took your jobs? Go ahead, there you go. There are a</br>   lot of vacancies, making these open for those jobs, go ahead, man. All</br>   yours buddy, knock yourself out.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But nobody wants to work those jobs, right? You see what I'm</br>   saying though, right?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Definitely. So, how do you feel, do you feel like American…?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I don't want to say I feel like American. Spiritually, me myself,</br>   as an individual, I feel like now that I've been in Mexico and been living</br>   the real life of a real life Mexican—because man, it's hard out here, you</br>   know?—I feel like if I say I'm American, I feel like I'm betraying who I</br>   am. Because I have American… Yes, I'm from... Because even then I can't</br>   even say I'm American cause I'm not from there, that's why I'm here, right?</br>   But the way I feel, yeah, I guess I am what they call me here, el gabacho,</br>   the American, the white boy. Do I feel it? I feel it only because I miss my</br>   home and that's what I want to be in order to be okay over there. I mean,</br>   if that's what I have to be in order to be okay over there and then, okay,</br>   yeah, I'm American.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But when I'm amongst individuals, Mexicans here and everything, my</br>   own people, I'm a Mexican. It still takes me a little while for me to be</br>   able to really integrate myself because to this point, to this day, I still</br>   have trouble expressing myself 100% in Spanish. I always try to better my</br>   Spanish, but it gets to the point where sometimes I can't fully express the</br>   way I feel at times.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: So, I speak in English but then you can't understand me in English</br>   because you speak all Spanish. So, those are the times when I really truly</br>   do feel American more than I feel Mexican. Because if I can't voice and</br>   express my true feelings in my native tongue then that's—my native tongue</br>   is English.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: So, you know what? Now that you do mention it, yeah, I feel more</br>   American now than I do Mexican and it's kind of mixed feelings. Because I'm</br>   trying to forget everything that I was over, that was going on over there,</br>   that I lived over there. But it's hard because I want to go back, I want to</br>   be able to punch in at Cheesecake Factory, and I want to be able to come</br>   home and just be with my family. But yeah, I do feel more American than I</br>   do Mexican and I'm not ashamed to say that's who I am. Short of being born</br>   over there, I'm from over there.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What was your experience when you got back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: My experience when I first arrived in Mexico, when I first got</br>   back in Mexico was surreal, it was a blur. I'm terribly afraid of heights.</br>   That's my fear. Not so much anymore but yeah, heights are not my thing. I</br>   remember being on the plane and it taking a turn, and I remember seeing all</br>   the buildings and I saw everything and I even scooted up in front of my</br>   seat to see and it's like I completely forgot that I was afraid of heights.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I felt happy and I don't know why. I don't know if it was</br>   because I was finally going to be free. And before it turned, before they</br>   told all the people, all the agents or the officials to sit down, they took</br>   the handcuffs off and they took the shackles off and I just, I'm like,</br>   “Whoa, okay, this shit is real. This is real.” And it did that turn and we</br>   finally got down and I saw the... we were passing by all hangars, the</br>   military hangar, the presidential hangar, certain company's hangars and</br>   whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Got off the plane, and I just remember looking back and looking at</br>   my hands and not seeing handcuffs or a police officer right next to me and</br>   I felt happy. But then I got on the phone and I called my mom and she was</br>   just happy that I was out and everything. She started crying and I then</br>   started crying too but then... that was just very mixed emotions. And the</br>   first couple of months, they were all right until I started figuring out</br>   that the individuals who are my family, as a matter of fact, who are</br>   supposed to help me out here were just after the money.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I feel like somebody's first experience or first impression or</br>   how they've gone about being in Mexico has to do greatly with their support</br>   system in Mexico. And unfortunately, I had the shorter end of the stick. I</br>   felt like I needed to pass by the things I needed to pass in order for me</br>   to get to the point where I am right now in this very point in time, in</br>   this chair, wearing these clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It wasn't the most prettiest thing. I was homeless for a while. I</br>   didn't have a house. My house was a 2016 Nissan Versa and that's only</br>   because I took a job as an Uber driver and it wasn't even my car, it was</br>   somebody else's. But I couldn't tell that guy it wasn't my car because he</br>   probably wouldn't even have let me keep driving. So, my first, my initial</br>   experience in Mexico was bad, it was bad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was lied to, I was deceived, I was stolen from. It's like every</br>   little turn it was always a smack in the head or something. But little by</br>   little I started getting acclimated to everything that was going on. How I</br>   should go about moving in certain areas or how I should talk, how I should</br>   move. Better yet, how to adapt to certain situations.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did the Mexican government provide help in that transition?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: The Mexican government, they provided some help. They provided 50</br>   pesos when I first got here. And they just give me a whole bunch of</br>   pamphlets of school and housing, right? But I feel as though independent</br>   organizations were the ones who ultimately would have helped me a lot more.</br>   When I first got off the plane, they told me about all the resources, all</br>   the help, all the things that their company or their organization did for</br>   other people, deportees. So, I feel like independent organizations would</br>   have helped me more than the Mexican government.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: What can the Mexican government do to help deportees?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Well, I mean, look, when I first got here, apart from them giving</br>   me 50 pesos... In my opinion, the Mexican government can be more supportive</br>   in having—I don't know,—what I was thinking is probably a fund, you know?</br>   Or maybe a fund or some type of little packet. Not saying that we all are</br>   entitled to it, but it'd be good to get here and have a little bit of money</br>   or a place for yourself, or right away giving out jobs or something like</br>   that. I'm not saying that the Mexico City doesn't have jobs for a bilingual</br>   speaker or bilingual people but it's through third party organizations,</br>   outsourcing and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But if the Mexican government really do want to help then that</br>   would be my suggestion. More jobs, more jobs for people like us. And not</br>   just for people us more so, but that would help out everybody else. Or</br>   simply, when I got here maybe there'd be a little fund that everybody gets,</br>   a certain amount of money to start their own business. Because I did hear</br>   about something like that. That there are help for people that want to</br>   start their business, especially if you're deportees.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Now I still haven't been pointed towards the right direction as to</br>   how to go about doing that. I mean, I've looked for help but I always come</br>   to a dead end. And it varies from city to city. Because somebody who I was</br>   with in the detention center—we left the same day and everything—but he's</br>   from Monterey and he actually he actually got 30,000 pesos from the Mexican</br>   government. I'm not sure what branch it was from or where exactly it came</br>   from, but he showed me everything. He proved it to me, so I know there is</br>   help, but I feel like there is not that much awareness.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I feel like, obviously because of the corruption or anything they</br>   don't want to help us because they much rather keep that money for</br>   themselves then to give it out. So, I feel like more awareness as well. If</br>   there is that help, then let us know. Let us know we have that help. Let us</br>   know you are there and we can help. Not just that we've come here from a</br>   different country and now go ahead, do whatever you can. No, I mean, just</br>   help us out too.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: I'm just wrapping up. Why do you think so many people from Mexico</br>   have a negative perception of returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Because of what their family members tell them. And the reason why</br>   returning deportees have a bad perception or a bad idea or a bad image of</br>   why they shouldn't come back is because well, in the first place, their</br>   family... Every individual has their own story, right? Obviously, that</br>   individual's family has told them the story of why they moved to America.</br>   And if they themselves, if their own family didn't want to live here, that</br>   in its own instills fear in them.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I mean, we're humans, right? We fear the unknown. We fear what we</br>   don't know, especially we fear change. We're creatures of habit. If you</br>   take me out of my element, if you took me out of Chicago, I'm like, “Shit,</br>   I don't know what's going on man.” I didn't know I couldn't walk after I</br>   paid my tacos. I didn't know I had to give back [inaudible 00:25:14], the</br>   glass bottle. I didn't know that. I didn't know I had to pay five pesos if</br>   I want to use the bathroom around here.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: My family painted me a picture of here that it was going to be</br>   horrible. Because that's what they lived, that's what they know. That's the</br>   reason why they moved. Like, “Hey man, living over there is going to be</br>   horrible. Don't go over there, fight the case, stay here. You're not going</br>   to be able to do anything over there, it's so hard. Minimum wage—the pay is</br>   horrible, the jobs are horrible.” And they're feeding you what they know</br>   and what they lived because they don't know any better, they don't know</br>   anything else.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And for a person who doesn't know a country, then they're going to</br>   take heed to that. If I watch a movie and I tell my friend, “Hey man, don't</br>   watch that movie, that movie is horrible.” Yeah, I watched it, you didn't</br>   and now you're going to take my opinion and apply it to your own beliefs.</br>   Okay, well, I mean, he's my friend he wouldn't lie to me, why would he lie</br>   to me? You're my mom, you're my brother, my sister, whatever. If you say</br>   it's bad, it's bad.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, do you think a lot of deportees, when they return, turn to</br>   crime?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: When they return to what, I'm sorry?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: To Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I think a lot of the deportees, when they come back, yes. But I</br>   think more about their family—the inability to help your family member, the</br>   person who you love is one of the most horrible... it's a horrible feeling,</br>   not being able to help, let alone help one of your family members.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I remember my mom crying over the phone and telling me, “Man, I</br>   just want to help you. I wish I could just go and get you.“ Or, “Man, I'm</br>   going to ask around and see if I can find a lawyer and everything.” Oh my</br>   god, don't let me get started on the lawyers over there. They're not quite</br>   good people, right? Because they take advantage of that as well. But that's</br>   another conversation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, on that piece about helping families. What do you think the US</br>   government can do to help Mexican deportees and the families that they</br>   leave behind? You left your family.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: If it'd be up to me, everybody would be together and there would</br>   be no borders and no laws. But what the US government can do to help</br>   families in that position is if one of your family members is in a</br>   detention center, you automatically— there should be a law, there should be</br>   a rule, whatever man—can go and visit. You can go visit and get visited by</br>   anybody who they want and they can't touch them. It doesn't matter if it's</br>   a federal, state law or whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: You can't deprive somebody of their family like that, man. I</br>   understand you're not from here, and okay, they're in deportation</br>   proceedings and everything, but that's why there's so many fights in there,</br>   you know? That's where there's so much aggression, so much tension, because</br>   you don't know what's going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="7bcefe34-1e10-4e62-8431-9f92f4c0d834" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Feelings, Hope">Rodolfo: Literally, I spoke to a person who said, “Man, if I do bad things<br>

   never into gangs or anything, but around the area I lived in there was a<br>
   bunch of gangs and... I was beat up two or three times bad just by walking<br>
   home. And it was all documented, I had police reports and everything. And<br>
   because of that I was in therapy for while. My mother sought out a help<br>
   from a psychiatrist because of the sexual abuse I had as a child in<br>
   California, as a matter of fact.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I took Risperdal and a Ritalin, Risperdal for the anxiety and the<br>
   Ritalin and for the ADHD. So, we tried everything. The mental health side,<br>
   the mental health asylum, everything. But it was just going to take longer<br>
   and longer and longer and I was tired of it. I didn't want to be locked up<br>
   anymore. So, finally I just told my mom, “You know what man, that's it, I'm<br>
   done. I don't want to do this anymore.” She asked me, “Is this what you<br>
   want to do?” And I told her, “Yeah.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: She told me, “You know what? I'd much rather see you over there<br>
   and be free then not being able to see you here at all.” Because there was<br>
   a lot of people that went to go visit their loved ones and they used to get<br>
   picked up. Sometimes they wouldn't even let you see your loved ones and<br>
   right away ask you for your identification, your social security card, your<br>
   nationality and everything and they would get picked up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And I always told my mom, “Don't ever come visit me. Don't ever<br>
   come visit me because if you do, chances are they're going to take you<br>
   too.” And you know, that would always break my heart because I would want<br>
   to see my mom. I'd want to see my dad and everything, but I wasn't able to.<br>
   So, that experience was just horrible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: When you were in the detention center what were the conditions? Did<br>
   you have access the medicine you needed? Did you have access to food and<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: The company that made the jail was called GEO Corp and they were<br>
   actually, I'm not going to lie to you, they actually were pretty good,<br>
   health-wise, not so much security-wise. A lot of things would happen in<br>
   there that definitely shouldn't have ever happened. But with the food and<br>
   everything, it was good. In my opinion it was because of the company. I<br>
   feel as though if it was up to the government... Thank God it was an<br>

   their own jail, I feel they would be completely different.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It was [Pause] a pleasantly... there's no way to describe it, it<br>
   was bad. It was bad, but for what it was I guess it was okay. I don't see<br>
   there being an in-between or any pretty way to paint that picture as to how<br>
   good or bad it was in there. Because at the end of the day you're deprived<br>
   of your freedom. You can't just pick up the phone whenever you want and<br>
   call your loved ones because you've got to pay for that too. You got pay<br>
   for that. And if you want to take a shower, you have to buy your soap,<br>
   right? You've got to buy it yourself, you've got to buy everything. And now<br>
   you're becoming a liability for your family, you're becoming another bill.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: You're becoming another bill and that's what I didn't want. So,<br>
   that's why I started working. And now, older, I'm becoming another bill.<br>
   So, I don't get it. You're taking us away from the jobs that we have and<br>
   everything. You know? So, take us back to our country. And I'm not sure if<br>
   it this is a fact or not, but I was reading when I first got in here, there<br>
   was a time where there wasn't enough field workers for, I think,<br>
   avocado—or, not avocado, I think it was oranges or something like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And I remember me saying, “Well, there goes all the deportees.<br>

   and longer and longer and I was tired of it. I didn't want to be locked up<br>

   want to do?” And I told her, “Yeah.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: She told me, “You know what? I'd much rather see you over there<br>
   and be free then not being able to see you here at all.” Because there was<br>
   a lot of people that went to go visit their loved ones and they used to get<br>
   picked up. Sometimes they wouldn't even let you see your loved ones and<br>
   right away ask you for your identification, your social security card, your<br>
   nationality and everything and they would get picked up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And I always told my mom, “Don't ever come visit me. Don't ever<br>
   come visit me because if you do, chances are they're going to take you<br>
   too.” And you know, that would always break my heart because I would want<br>
   to see my mom. I'd want to see my dad and everything, but I wasn't able to.<br>
   So, that experience was just horrible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

   actually, I'm not going to lie to you, they actually were pretty good,<br>
   health-wise, not so much security-wise. A lot of things would happen in<br>
   there that definitely shouldn't have ever happened. But with the food and<br>
   everything, it was good. In my opinion it was because of the company. I<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It was [Pause] a pleasantly... there's no way to describe it, it<br>
   was bad. It was bad, but for what it was I guess it was okay. I don't see<br>
   there being an in-between or any pretty way to paint that picture as to how<br>
   good or bad it was in there. Because at the end of the day you're deprived<br>
   of your freedom. You can't just pick up the phone whenever you want and<br>
   call your loved ones because you've got to pay for that too. You got pay<br>
   for that. And if you want to take a shower, you have to buy your soap,<br>
   right? You've got to buy it yourself, you've got to buy everything. And now<br>
   you're becoming a liability for your family, you're becoming another bill.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: You're becoming another bill and that's what I didn't want. So,<br>
   that's why I started working. And now, older, I'm becoming another bill.<br>
   So, I don't get it. You're taking us away from the jobs that we have and<br>
   everything. You know? So, take us back to our country. And I'm not sure if<br>
   it this is a fact or not, but I was reading when I first got in here, there<br>
   was a time where there wasn't enough field workers for, I think,<br>
   avocado—or, not avocado, I think it was oranges or something like that.<br>
 <br>

   right away ask you for your identification, your social security card, your<br>
   nationality and everything and they would get picked up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And I always told my mom, “Don't ever come visit me. Don't ever<br>
   come visit me because if you do, chances are they're going to take you<br>
   too.” And you know, that would always break my heart because I would want<br>
   to see my mom. I'd want to see my dad and everything, but I wasn't able to.<br>
   So, that experience was just horrible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: When you were in the detention center what were the conditions? Did<br>
   you have access the medicine you needed? Did you have access to food and<br>
   water?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: The company that made the jail was called GEO Corp and they were<br>
   actually, I'm not going to lie to you, they actually were pretty good,<br>
   health-wise, not so much security-wise. A lot of things would happen in<br>
   there that definitely shouldn't have ever happened. But with the food and<br>
   everything, it was good. In my opinion it was because of the company. I<br>
   feel as though if it was up to the government... Thank God it was an<br>
   independent company that was hired by DHS as opposed to if DHS were to make<br>
   their own jail, I feel they would be completely different.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It was [Pause] a pleasantly... there's no way to describe it, it<br>
   was bad. It was bad, but for what it was I guess it was okay. I don't see<br>
   there being an in-between or any pretty way to paint that picture as to how<br>
   good or bad it was in there. Because at the end of the day you're deprived<br>
   of your freedom. You can't just pick up the phone whenever you want and<br>
   call your loved ones because you've got to pay for that too. You got pay<br>
   for that. And if you want to take a shower, you have to buy your soap,<br>
   right? You've got to buy it yourself, you've got to buy everything. And now<br>
   you're becoming a liability for your family, you're becoming another bill.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: You're becoming another bill and that's what I didn't want. So,<br>
   that's why I started working. And now, older, I'm becoming another bill.<br>
   So, I don't get it. You're taking us away from the jobs that we have and<br>
   everything. You know? So, take us back to our country. And I'm not sure if<br>
   it this is a fact or not, but I was reading when I first got in here, there<br>
   was a time where there wasn't enough field workers for, I think,<br>
   avocado—or, not avocado, I think it was oranges or something like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And I remember me saying, “Well, there goes all the deportees.<br>
   There goes all the people you guys deported. Where are the people that were<br>
   so outraged because we took your jobs? Go ahead, there you go. There are a<br>
   lot of vacancies, making these open for those jobs, go ahead, man. All<br>
   yours buddy, knock yourself out.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: But nobody wants to work those jobs, right? You see what I'm<br>
   saying though, right?<br>
 <br>

   they put me in a different cell, because I kept on telling everybody not to<br>

   obviously federal laws are always gonna trump state laws. That's in the<br>

   the immigration, it was something I had never experienced in my life. I<br>
   mean, I was never deprived of my freedom. And it wasn't because I committed<br>
   an actual crime. I didn't go and take somebody's laptop, or I didn't go<br>
   into a store with a loaded gun and ask for money. No, it was one of the<br>

   affect the way you were involved in school, the things you wanted to do,<br>
   did that change? Is there anything that you...?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I didn't put as much effort as I did anymore. I knew, at the end<br>
   of the day, I'm not eligible for scholarships. I don't get any aid, I don't<br>
   get anything. In my mind I thought, “Man, what's the point of really<br>
   working hard in school if at the end of the day, I'm not gonna get any<br>
   help?” My mom is having to work to put me through college. No, I don't want<br>
   this, so I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna give her what she<br>
   wants, my diploma, my high school diploma. From then on, if I want to do<br>
   something, it'll be by my own hand, out of my own pocket. I didn't want her<br>
   to... Not that I was a burden or anything, my objective was for her not to<br>
   work that much. That's it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: After she told me that, I'm like, &quot;Well, okay, what's the point of<br>
   really working hard and putting your best effort into school if, in my<br>
   position, I won't be able to surpass US citizens.&quot; Then the aspect of<br>
   financial aid, or any aid at all, I'm not gonna have any of that. I tried<br>
   it with the fake social, but obviously it didn't go through. Nothing<br>
   happened. Yeah, it changed a lot. It changed the way I viewed everything<br>
   around me. Like, spring break all my friends would go certain places out of<br>
   the country, and I used to get invited and, &quot;No, I can't go man, my family<br>
   doesn't think...&quot; It would always have to be lie after lie after lie. I<br>
   didn't want to... for one, I always had that idea of like my mom and my<br>
   family always told me, &quot;Don't ever tell anybody you're an immigrant. If<br>
   somebody has that knowledge they can do you harm. They can take you away<br>
   from here, they can take us away from each other.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I'm seeing it now, with the families going across the border, and<br>
   them being separated. I didn't understand it at the time, and man, now I do<br>
   understand it. I didn't know how it really was until I finally got put in<br>
   handcuffs and got shipped to an immigration facility.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: What do you think you would have wanted or end up being before you<br>
   found out? What kind of things... Like you were on debate team that was—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I wanted to be a lawyer, man, that's what I wanted to be. That's<br>
   what I wanted to be, a lawyer. It's funny, because when I was younger I<br>
   wanted to be a lawyer. Then after that I'm like, &quot;I want to be an<br>
   immigration lawyer, that's what I want to be now. I want to be an<br>
   immigration lawyer.” I was already on the right track to being a lawyer,<br>
   but then when that happened, it really opened my eyes more to, &quot;Okay, let's<br>
   help my people.&quot; I didn't realize... I know individuals over there who are<br>
   citizens, and they're panhandling because they want to. They're on their<br>
   own addiction or for whatever reason right? Or people who are just living<br>
   off the government, but then I see some of my family members, or my<br>
   friends’ family members and they're not citizens but they have businesses.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: They have a business, they have trucks, they have houses, they're<br>
   great. They're not living off the Government, they're not asking for a<br>
   handout. They're living better than what a citizen is living. It's all<br>
   about how much work you put in, right? If you hang around people who don't<br>
   want to do anything, then you're not gonna do anything. I remember Gerald<br>
   Ford always told me that. He was like, &quot;If you want to be a millionaire,<br>
   hang around millionaires. If you want to be successful, hang around people<br>
   who do successful things, but if you want to keep doing what you're doing,<br>
   and just be a little caddie or whatever, stay here. Stay here and maybe one<br>
   day you'll do something else.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: He was very blunt in that aspect like, &quot;Always do a good job. I<br>
   don't care if you're a shit-shoveler, you're gonna be the best shit<br>
   shoveler there is.” That always stuck to me, that's why whatever I do, it's<br>
   always been 100%.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: That's good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Likewise.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: I'm amazed at your incredible story. When you talked about the trip<br>
   to DC, the debate club, and you got very sad—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: ... what made you sad, and did it make you feeling... Do you<br>
   remember what your feelings were as you sort of found that all these<br>
   options were gone to you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Well, it was just mixed emotions. I felt sad because I contributed<br>
   to the team a lot. I wasn't just there, and it made me sad because I wasn't<br>
   going to be able be with my friends, my teammates. It also made me mad<br>
   because all my life, all my short period, my whole time here in Chicago or<br>
   whatever, I don't think I've done anything bad. Why shouldn't I have the<br>
   privilege to go if I put in the same work as they did? Only because I don't<br>
   have a social security number or a document that lets me buy a plane ticket<br>
   and go over there? I think about it in a different—at the same time, I was<br>
   a little kid too—I just cried a lot. That night I just cried a lot because<br>
   I knew I wasn't gonna go. My mom spoke to the, I'm not sure what my mom<br>
   told her, but see, I don't think she told her that we're undocumented, and<br>
   I can't fly.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah, I just remember that night feeling very sad, very sad, but<br>
   then it turned into anger. It was like, &quot;Man, why can't I?&quot; It was always<br>
   just that, &quot;Why can't I? I put in the same work, and just because I wasn't<br>
   born here, I can't fly?&quot; I even looked into bus routes and everything to DC<br>
   and stuff like that, but my mom was like, &quot;No, you're crazy, you can't go<br>
   alone.&quot; She worked and everything, I just felt sad, mostly sad.<br>

   and just be a little caddie or whatever, stay here. Stay here and maybe one<br>
   day you'll do something else.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: He was very blunt in that aspect like, &quot;Always do a good job. I<br>
   don't care if you're a shit-shoveler, you're gonna be the best shit<br>
   shoveler there is.” That always stuck to me, that's why whatever I do, it's<br>
   always been 100%.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: That's good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Can I speak? I'm Anita, I'm the director of this project.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: I'm really pleased to meet you—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Likewise.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: I'm amazed at your incredible story. When you talked about the trip<br>
   to DC, the debate club, and you got very sad—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: ... what made you sad, and did it make you feeling... Do you<br>
   remember what your feelings were as you sort of found that all these<br>
   options were gone to you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Well, it was just mixed emotions. I felt sad because I contributed<br>
   to the team a lot. I wasn't just there, and it made me sad because I wasn't<br>
   going to be able be with my friends, my teammates. It also made me mad<br>
   because all my life, all my short period, my whole time here in Chicago or<br>
   whatever, I don't think I've done anything bad. Why shouldn't I have the<br>
   privilege to go if I put in the same work as they did? Only because I don't<br>
   have a social security number or a document that lets me buy a plane ticket<br>
   and go over there? I think about it in a different—at the same time, I was<br>
   a little kid too—I just cried a lot. That night I just cried a lot because<br>
   I knew I wasn't gonna go. My mom spoke to the, I'm not sure what my mom<br>
   told her, but see, I don't think she told her that we're undocumented, and<br>
   I can't fly.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah, I just remember that night feeling very sad, very sad, but<br>
   then it turned into anger. It was like, &quot;Man, why can't I?&quot; It was always<br>
   just that, &quot;Why can't I? I put in the same work, and just because I wasn't<br>
   born here, I can't fly?&quot; I even looked into bus routes and everything to DC<br>
   and stuff like that, but my mom was like, &quot;No, you're crazy, you can't go<br>
   alone.&quot; She worked and everything, I just felt sad, mostly sad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="bb9a5856-208d-471f-8d62-cebb59116577" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="traveling">Sergio: After your mom told you couldn't go on that trip, how did that<br>
   affect the way you were involved in school, the things you wanted to do,<br>
   did that change? Is there anything that you...?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I didn't put as much effort as I did anymore. I knew, at the end<br>
   of the day, I'm not eligible for scholarships. I don't get any aid, I don't<br>
   get anything. In my mind I thought, “Man, what's the point of really<br>
   working hard in school if at the end of the day, I'm not gonna get any<br>
   help?” My mom is having to work to put me through college. No, I don't want<br>
   this, so I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna give her what she<br>
   wants, my diploma, my high school diploma. From then on, if I want to do<br>
   something, it'll be by my own hand, out of my own pocket. I didn't want her<br>
   to... Not that I was a burden or anything, my objective was for her not to<br>
   work that much. That's it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: After she told me that, I'm like, &quot;Well, okay, what's the point of<br>
   really working hard and putting your best effort into school if, in my<br>
   position, I won't be able to surpass US citizens.&quot; Then the aspect of<br>
   financial aid, or any aid at all, I'm not gonna have any of that. I tried<br>
   it with the fake social, but obviously it didn't go through. Nothing<br>
   happened. Yeah, it changed a lot. It changed the way I viewed everything<br>
   around me. Like, spring break all my friends would go certain places out of<br>
   the country, and I used to get invited and, &quot;No, I can't go man, my family<br>
   doesn't think...&quot; It would always have to be lie after lie after lie. I<br>
   didn't want to... for one, I always had that idea of like my mom and my<br>
   family always told me, &quot;Don't ever tell anybody you're an immigrant. If<br>
   somebody has that knowledge they can do you harm. They can take you away<br>
   from here, they can take us away from each other.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I'm seeing it now, with the families going across the border, and<br>
   them being separated. I didn't understand it at the time, and man, now I do<br>
   understand it. I didn't know how it really was until I finally got put in<br>
   handcuffs and got shipped to an immigration facility.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: What do you think you would have wanted or end up being before you<br>
   found out? What kind of things... Like you were on debate team that was—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I wanted to be a lawyer, man, that's what I wanted to be. That's<br>
   what I wanted to be, a lawyer. It's funny, because when I was younger I<br>
   wanted to be a lawyer. Then after that I'm like, &quot;I want to be an<br>
   immigration lawyer, that's what I want to be now. I want to be an<br>
   immigration lawyer.” I was already on the right track to being a lawyer,<br>
   but then when that happened, it really opened my eyes more to, &quot;Okay, let's<br>
   help my people.&quot; I didn't realize... I know individuals over there who are<br>
   citizens, and they're panhandling because they want to. They're on their<br>
   own addiction or for whatever reason right? Or people who are just living<br>
   off the government, but then I see some of my family members, or my<br>
   friends’ family members and they're not citizens but they have businesses.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: They have a business, they have trucks, they have houses, they're<br>
   great. They're not living off the Government, they're not asking for a<br>
   handout. They're living better than what a citizen is living. It's all<br>
   about how much work you put in, right? If you hang around people who don't<br>
   want to do anything, then you're not gonna do anything. I remember Gerald<br>
   Ford always told me that. He was like, &quot;If you want to be a millionaire,<br>

  </span> Anita: Did Gerald Ford know you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: No, Gerald Ford didn't know I was undocumented, no. I was still</br>   very young at that point. My mother and my family always told me, &quot;Don't</br>   let anybody know you're undocumented.” If somebody finds out, for whatever</br>   reason, there's some people who just are plain out racist or don't want</br>   people like me in the States. Sometimes they just do things to... I don't</br>   know. That's what I understood and that's what I took in and that's what I</br>   applied to my life.

   passions. Always, always, always I love to drive. I couldn't get my license<br>
   over there. I remember even in high school in drivers ed, I knew what the<br>
   answer was, but I asked my mom, “Hey mom, can I apply for drivers ed, so I<br>
   can get my license? “She was like, &quot;You know you can't get your license.&quot;<br>
   Again, one of the primary things, I’m like damn, I'm just not gonna be able<br>
   to drive all my life? Or if I do drive and I get pulled over—as a matter of<br>
   fact, that's the reason why I got deported, driving without a valid drivers<br>
   license.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I never got why the paper said, &quot;Driving on a suspended license.&quot;<br>
   I would always ask them, &quot;If I don't have a license, why is it suspended?&quot;<br>
   They just told me, &quot;Because you have a drivers license number, but you<br>
   don't have a drivers license? I'm like, &quot;Okay, so if I have a drivers<br>
   license number, why can't I get my drivers license?&quot; &quot;You don't have the<br>
   proper documentation.&quot; I'm like, &quot;But I have my...&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: One day I thought, “Well why don't I just grab the driver license<br>
   number and have somebody make me a fake drivers license, and put the<br>
   drivers license on there?” But see, if I get caught with it, now I'm in<br>
   more trouble, and now I'm seen as a real criminal, because now I'm going<br>
   around the system once again. That's why we don't want you here, because<br>
   you're gonna do things like that. [Exhale] I haven't talked about this in a<br>
   while. It just makes me want to…I don’t know.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah, I worked all the time, I never stopped. One of the first<br>
   jobs I had…My uncle worked at a restaurant called, Baker's Square in<br>
   Chicago. It was on the corner of Tui and Pratt. I really, really, really<br>
   wanted—I think I was in fifth or sixth grade—a phone. I wanted a phone,<br>
   it’s called the Psychic Slide. Phones used to flip, but this one slides. I<br>
   wasn't gonna ask my mom for it, so I asked my uncle. &quot;Hey man, I know you<br>
   work at Baker's Square and I know around the holiday season it gets really<br>
   busy. Can I help you? Can I go?&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, yeah, if you want.&quot; I<br>
   used to wake up like 3:00 in the morning, and I used to go and help him<br>
   out. After that, I really liked making money and I really liked dressing<br>
   nice, I liked having my nice haircut or whatever. My very, very first job<br>
   was in Wilmette, Illinois. I was a caddie. Yeah, and then—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: On the golf course?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: On the golf course, yeah. Wilmette Golf Course actually. I<br>
   remember I was always the first one there. They used to choose us, when<br>
   everybody got there, &quot;Okay, you come with me, you come with me.&quot; I used to<br>
   always go there and there was a gentleman by the name of... Man, I forgot<br>
   his name. Like the President, Gerald Ford, that was his name Gerald Ford!<br>
   The only reason I remembered was because of the President. He used to<br>
   always get there around the same time I got there. He finally asked me, &quot;Do<br>
   you want to be my personal caddie? I don't want you working anymore with<br>
   all these other kids, because nobody wants to work. Do you want to be my<br>
   personal caddie?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, absolutely.&quot; It was going really, really<br>
   well and everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I got to high school, I had a number of jobs. I worked at Subway,<br>
   I worked at Chili's, I worked at... What was it? Outback Steak House, but<br>
   then I finally just got to the Cheesecake Factory, and that's where I<br>
   stayed the remainder of my time. The remainder of my time I stayed there,<br>
   and I started from the busboy and I finally ended up being a bartender. One<br>
   of the head bartenders, one of the head servers, they used to pay-out<br>
   people and everything. Obviously, I didn't have my social or anything, but<br>
   I was a little bit older than what I really was. When I first got there,<br>
   when I first, first started working I think I was like 14. Obviously you<br>
   can't work that young, I think actually, I was 18, at 14.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I didn't see it as anything bad. I knew that if I got caught with<br>
   my fake ID and my fake social security card I'd get in trouble, but that's<br>
   why we're there, that's why we worked. I didn't get a fake ID to go party<br>
   or go get into clubs or bars or anything. The main purpose of it was for me<br>
   to be able to get a job, and so my mom wouldn't have to work all those<br>
   hours that she used to work. She used to work at a Burger King, overnight.<br>
   I used to barely see her, and I didn't want that anymore. I told her, &quot;You<br>
   don't have to work that much if I start working. We can help each other<br>
   out, we can, we're a team.” It was only my mother and I until I turned 14,<br>
   when she met my stepdad. All throughout that, it was just my mother and I.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah, I worked all the time, I never stopped. One of the first<br>
   jobs I had…My uncle worked at a restaurant called, Baker's Square in<br>
   Chicago. It was on the corner of Tui and Pratt. I really, really, really<br>
   wanted—I think I was in fifth or sixth grade—a phone. I wanted a phone,<br>
   it’s called the Psychic Slide. Phones used to flip, but this one slides. I<br>
   wasn't gonna ask my mom for it, so I asked my uncle. &quot;Hey man, I know you<br>
   work at Baker's Square and I know around the holiday season it gets really<br>
   busy. Can I help you? Can I go?&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, yeah, if you want.&quot; I<br>
   used to wake up like 3:00 in the morning, and I used to go and help him<br>
   out. After that, I really liked making money and I really liked dressing<br>
   nice, I liked having my nice haircut or whatever. My very, very first job<br>
   was in Wilmette, Illinois. I was a caddie. Yeah, and then—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: On the golf course?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: On the golf course, yeah. Wilmette Golf Course actually. I<br>
   remember I was always the first one there. They used to choose us, when<br>
   everybody got there, &quot;Okay, you come with me, you come with me.&quot; I used to<br>
   always go there and there was a gentleman by the name of... Man, I forgot<br>
   his name. Like the President, Gerald Ford, that was his name Gerald Ford!<br>
   The only reason I remembered was because of the President. He used to<br>
   always get there around the same time I got there. He finally asked me, &quot;Do<br>
   you want to be my personal caddie? I don't want you working anymore with<br>
   all these other kids, because nobody wants to work. Do you want to be my<br>
   personal caddie?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, absolutely.&quot; It was going really, really<br>
   well and everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I got to high school, I had a number of jobs. I worked at Subway,<br>
   I worked at Chili's, I worked at... What was it? Outback Steak House, but<br>
   then I finally just got to the Cheesecake Factory, and that's where I<br>
   stayed the remainder of my time. The remainder of my time I stayed there,<br>
   and I started from the busboy and I finally ended up being a bartender. One<br>
   of the head bartenders, one of the head servers, they used to pay-out<br>
   people and everything. Obviously, I didn't have my social or anything, but<br>
   I was a little bit older than what I really was. When I first got there,<br>
   when I first, first started working I think I was like 14. Obviously you<br>
   can't work that young, I think actually, I was 18, at 14.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I didn't see it as anything bad. I knew that if I got caught with<br>
   my fake ID and my fake social security card I'd get in trouble, but that's<br>
   why we're there, that's why we worked. I didn't get a fake ID to go party<br>
   or go get into clubs or bars or anything. The main purpose of it was for me<br>
   to be able to get a job, and so my mom wouldn't have to work all those<br>
   hours that she used to work. She used to work at a Burger King, overnight.<br>
   I used to barely see her, and I didn't want that anymore. I told her, &quot;You<br>
   don't have to work that much if I start working. We can help each other<br>
   out, we can, we're a team.” It was only my mother and I until I turned 14,<br>
   when she met my stepdad. All throughout that, it was just my mother and I.<br>

   &quot;Don't go out that much. Stay indoors, because if they see you, they can<br>
   take you.&quot; I'm at a very young age, at that point, I think I was six or<br>
   seven. Adults are talking in the room and you hear them tell your mom,<br>
   &quot;Don't go out that much. If they see you out there, they're gonna grab<br>
   you.&quot; I thought like, “Whoa, who's gonna grab us, who's gonna grab mom?” I<br>
   didn't understand the concept of the legal side of migration. Why we're not<br>
   supposed to be here. I'd never quite fully understood why I wasn't supposed<br>
   to be there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

   school and do everything that you need to do, because we're not supposed to<br>
   be here.&quot; I asked him, &quot;Why not, why can't we be here?&quot; He told me, &quot;We're<br>
   immigrants, we come from a different country. You weren't born here, I<br>
   wasn't born here, and this isn't our country. People don't want us here<br>
   because they say we take their jobs. Or they have a preconceived image of<br>
   what an immigrant is.&quot; I still didn't understand it yet, I didn't know why.<br>
   You go to work, you pay your taxes, you do everything as my American<br>
   parent's friends do.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Everybody... I go to their house and, yeah, they have big ‘ol<br>
   houses and mansions and stuff like that, but at the end of the day, they go<br>
   to work, they have a job. I don't see you out here stealing or doing<br>
   anything, you're not causing any harm. Why can't we be here? He told us,<br>
   &quot;Well, I mean, that's just the way things are.&quot; I didn't understand that<br>
   until obviously I grew up and then I found that out. When I finally really,<br>
   really understood what an immigrant was or why I was an immigrant, it was<br>
   the day that—I was in a debate team in my middle school. We won, in the<br>
   whole district we won. We won the top prize. We went... Not national, I<br>
   think it was... Yeah, nationwide, we were supposed to go to DC.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: We were supposed to go to DC. I remember this then and it broke my<br>
   heart, so I want to even cry now [Emotional]. Damn. I asked my mom, &quot;Can I<br>
   go?&quot; She's like, &quot;No you can't.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because you can't fly.&quot;<br>
   I'm like, &quot;Why can't I fly?&quot; She said, &quot;Because you don't have a state ID,<br>
   you're not from here.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Damn.&quot; Then, I think she told the<br>
   school... She made something up, but that's when I finally knew it. Like,<br>
   &quot;Damn, this shit is real, this is real.&quot; Then after that I just, &quot;Okay,<br>

   Rodolfo: We were supposed to go to DC. I remember this then and it broke my<br>
   heart, so I want to even cry now [Emotional]. Damn. I asked my mom, &quot;Can I<br>
   go?&quot; She's like, &quot;No you can't.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because you can't fly.&quot;<br>
   I'm like, &quot;Why can't I fly?&quot; She said, &quot;Because you don't have a state ID,<br>
   you're not from here.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Damn.&quot; Then, I think she told the<br>
   school... She made something up, but that's when I finally knew it. Like,<br>
   &quot;Damn, this shit is real, this is real.&quot; Then after that I just, &quot;Okay,<br>
   whatever, I'm just gonna see where this takes us.&quot; Yeah, that's around the<br>
   time I found out.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: School? One of the first memories I have from school, after<br>
   Phoenix—I wasn't going to school in Phoenix, actually, I think I even<br>
   skipped kindergarten—we moved to Long Beach, California. And the only thing<br>
   I remember from school was my mom waking me up probably about four or five<br>
   in the morning. The sun wasn't even out yet, and she would walk me to this<br>
   random lady's house. Actually, she wasn't random, but she was just some<br>
   lady I didn't know. There was two other kids there, and I would be in<br>
   uniform. That was the first time I actually wore a uniform to go to school.<br>
   I was there, but I didn't really remember that much. When we moved to<br>
   Chicago, that's when everything changed.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I was a little bit older. I remember I went to Jordan Elementary.<br>
   It was in the North side of Chicago. We were there for a very brief moment,<br>
   because then we moved to Evanston. Evanston was literally right next to<br>
   Chicago. The school I was attending was called Orrington Elementary. The<br>
   reason why we moved, once again, is because she wanted a better quality of<br>
   life for me. Where I was at, it was all English, there was no Spanish.<br>
   Obviously, there were Hispanic kids who already spoke English, but there<br>
   wasn't... She, herself didn't know English, so how could she teach me, so<br>
   how could I be integrated into a school that doesn't even accommodate for<br>
   individuals or kids who don't know English?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: She moved schools, although we were still in Chicago because we<br>
   needed... what was it? Proof of residency. We lived out of district, and<br>
   she would get fined or I wouldn't be able to go to school there. The point<br>
   is I went to school to Orrington Elementary. The program was called the TWI<br>
   (Two Way Immersion). It was a bilingual program and that's where I learned<br>
   my English, that school. Friends and everything. I feel as though like,<br>
   that's why I learned my English so well, because I really, really wanted to<br>
   learn it. I always heard kids at the park or at the store, at Target, at<br>
   Jewels, or whatever and everybody spoke English, right? I just felt<br>
   fascinated, I was intrigued by it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It was a whole different language that I didn't know, and I wanted<br>
   to master it. I wanted to be able to talk as they spoke, or talk as they<br>
   talked. School was a very cool experience. I always had a lot of friends,<br>
   and I was always the life of the classroom. I wasn't probably the best<br>
   behaved kid, but I was always integrated in to what was going on with the<br>
   school.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Do you remember any teachers or people?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah, absolutely. Ms. Mule, Ms. Mule was my second or third grade<br>
   teacher, I'm not sure which one it was. She was awesome, she always help me<br>
   out with the English, always. Even in parent teacher conferences, she would<br>
   literally always talk to my mom as if she'd be really interested. She would<br>
   show genuine interest in what was going on with, not just me, but with the<br>
   Hispanic kids. Kids who had trouble with English or weren't doing the best<br>
   academically. She always would tell me, &quot;Don't worry, you're gonna get it.<br>
   You're gonna learn it.&quot; She had such a big heart.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Still even, my mother and I still talk about the teacher to this<br>
   point in time. She tells me, &quot;I remember Ms. Mule and she used to use hand<br>
   gestures. She would always be like, 'Yeah, for this or for that.'&quot; Even<br>
   though I knew I wasn't the smartest or the most best behaved kid, she would<br>
   always have that initiative to get us there. Get us to that point. Yeah,<br>
   that was one of my favorite teachers. Man, I value that so much actually<br>
   now. I miss that teacher. Another teacher was in fifth grade, his name was<br>
   Mr. Stoom. He was Argentinian, he was from Argentina. He was another great<br>
   teacher. He always told us, &quot;Don't ever forget where you came from. Your<br>
   roots are who you are, even though you all are coming from different parts<br>
   of the world, don't ever forget who you are and where you come from.&quot;<br>
   That's one of the biggest things right now, I'm kind of ashamed of.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I'm not, because I was so... What do they say, &quot;Americanized.&quot; In<br>
   Chicago, I was so in America. I never dedicated the time to open a book or<br>
   even Google something of my home country. Now that I get here, I don't know<br>
   what is going on. Just barely a couple of months ago, I found out Mexico is<br>
   a third-world country. I didn't know that. I go to Polanco Fendi, Prado,<br>
   Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton boutiques. To me, that's not a third world<br>
   country. Yeah, that teacher was the one who started opening my eyes up more<br>
   to my surroundings.<br>

   You're gonna learn it.&quot; She had such a big heart.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Still even, my mother and I still talk about the teacher to this<br>
   point in time. She tells me, &quot;I remember Ms. Mule and she used to use hand<br>
   gestures. She would always be like, 'Yeah, for this or for that.'&quot; Even<br>
   though I knew I wasn't the smartest or the most best behaved kid, she would<br>
   always have that initiative to get us there. Get us to that point. Yeah,<br>
   that was one of my favorite teachers. Man, I value that so much actually<br>
   now. I miss that teacher. Another teacher was in fifth grade, his name was<br>
   Mr. Stoom. He was Argentinian, he was from Argentina. He was another great<br>
   teacher. He always told us, &quot;Don't ever forget where you came from. Your<br>
   roots are who you are, even though you all are coming from different parts<br>
   of the world, don't ever forget who you are and where you come from.&quot;<br>
   That's one of the biggest things right now, I'm kind of ashamed of.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I'm not, because I was so... What do they say, &quot;Americanized.&quot; In<br>
   Chicago, I was so in America. I never dedicated the time to open a book or<br>
   even Google something of my home country. Now that I get here, I don't know<br>
   what is going on. Just barely a couple of months ago, I found out Mexico is<br>
   a third-world country. I didn't know that. I go to Polanco Fendi, Prado,<br>
   Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton boutiques. To me, that's not a third world<br>
   country. Yeah, that teacher was the one who started opening my eyes up more<br>
   to my surroundings.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: School? One of the first memories I have from school, after<br>
   Phoenix—I wasn't going to school in Phoenix, actually, I think I even<br>
   skipped kindergarten—we moved to Long Beach, California. And the only thing<br>
   I remember from school was my mom waking me up probably about four or five<br>
   in the morning. The sun wasn't even out yet, and she would walk me to this<br>
   random lady's house. Actually, she wasn't random, but she was just some<br>
   lady I didn't know. There was two other kids there, and I would be in<br>
   uniform. That was the first time I actually wore a uniform to go to school.<br>
   I was there, but I didn't really remember that much. When we moved to<br>
   Chicago, that's when everything changed.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I was a little bit older. I remember I went to Jordan Elementary.<br>
   It was in the North side of Chicago. We were there for a very brief moment,<br>
   because then we moved to Evanston. Evanston was literally right next to<br>
   Chicago. The school I was attending was called Orrington Elementary. The<br>
   reason why we moved, once again, is because she wanted a better quality of<br>
   life for me. Where I was at, it was all English, there was no Spanish.<br>
   Obviously, there were Hispanic kids who already spoke English, but there<br>
   wasn't... She, herself didn't know English, so how could she teach me, so<br>
   how could I be integrated into a school that doesn't even accommodate for<br>
   individuals or kids who don't know English?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: She moved schools, although we were still in Chicago because we<br>
   needed... what was it? Proof of residency. We lived out of district, and<br>
   she would get fined or I wouldn't be able to go to school there. The point<br>
   is I went to school to Orrington Elementary. The program was called the TWI<br>
   (Two Way Immersion). It was a bilingual program and that's where I learned<br>
   my English, that school. Friends and everything. I feel as though like,<br>
   that's why I learned my English so well, because I really, really wanted to<br>
   learn it. I always heard kids at the park or at the store, at Target, at<br>
   Jewels, or whatever and everybody spoke English, right? I just felt<br>
   fascinated, I was intrigued by it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It was a whole different language that I didn't know, and I wanted<br>
   to master it. I wanted to be able to talk as they spoke, or talk as they<br>
   talked. School was a very cool experience. I always had a lot of friends,<br>
   and I was always the life of the classroom. I wasn't probably the best<br>
   behaved kid, but I was always integrated in to what was going on with the<br>
   school.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Do you remember any teachers or people?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah, absolutely. Ms. Mule, Ms. Mule was my second or third grade<br>
   teacher, I'm not sure which one it was. She was awesome, she always help me<br>
   out with the English, always. Even in parent teacher conferences, she would<br>
   literally always talk to my mom as if she'd be really interested. She would<br>
   show genuine interest in what was going on with, not just me, but with the<br>
   Hispanic kids. Kids who had trouble with English or weren't doing the best<br>
   academically. She always would tell me, &quot;Don't worry, you're gonna get it.<br>
   You're gonna learn it.&quot; She had such a big heart.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: One of the very first memories I have of the US, was, I was in a<br>
   truck with my mom—I'm not sure if this was before or after the fact, that<br>
   we had already arrived because we arrived in Phoenix, Arizona—was somebody<br>
   asking my mom, &quot;Have you and your son ate?&quot; I remember my mom telling him,<br>
   &quot;No, but I have a sandwich here and some snacks for him.&quot; He went, &quot;No,<br>
   here, you're in America now, you're in Phoenix now, let's go get a burger.&quot;<br>
   I remember that somebody bought me—I don't know if it was her or him, the<br>
   driver—a kid's meal from MacDonald's. This is when they had... I'm not<br>
   sure…it was like the little hand-held games. I'm not sure, I think it was<br>
   the Rug Rats or something like that. I remember getting that little toy and<br>
   thinking, wow, it's a kid's... It had little fries and a burger, and you<br>
   get a toy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It was the first time I had ever saw that, and I got really happy,<br>
   because I was playing the little game and all that. I thought that was the<br>
   coolest thing in the world. After then, we went into a room... it couldn't<br>
   have been more... It was just a standard living room, but there was<br>
   probably like 50 or 60 people in there. Some of them were sitting and it<br>
   smelled horrible. It obviously wasn't the best place. I guess it was just<br>
   for people waiting for their relatives to go pick them up or something, I'm<br>
   not sure. It was just my mother and I and I remember there was a lady with<br>
   a big pot, and she was just cooking. I'm not sure what she was cooking but<br>
   we went into another room and all I remember hearing was a big slam.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I looked back and it was a cage. It was literally like they<br>
   fashioned a metal door with metal bars between the thresholds of the living<br>
   room from end to end so nobody could get out. Then the windows were the<br>
   same, they had burglar bars so nobody would get out. I was wondering, why<br>
   is this happening? At that time, obviously, you were a kid, you don't<br>
   understand what's going on. First I got fed, I have a little game, and now<br>
   I'm in this steel cage that smells horrible. I remember somebody arguing<br>
   with the other person that, &quot;The bucket was full. The bucket was full.&quot; I<br>
   was hearing that, &quot;You need to empty out this bucket.&quot; I realized that was<br>
   the bathroom, that's why it smelled so horrible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I remember the guy just closing a curtain, and just telling me to,<br>
   &quot;Shut up.&quot; That's when I felt fear for the first time. Even though I was in<br>
   the desert and everything, that's the very, very first time I felt genuine<br>
   fear. I didn't know what was going on. I felt it because my mom felt it.<br>
   She was just hugging me, and that was like the last thing I remember. After<br>
   that I remember just waking up in the apartment complex. In a room, but it<br>
   was completely different, it was somebody else. I guess these people knew<br>
   my mother, because they spoke to her by name and everything. That was one<br>

   understand what's going on. First I got fed, I have a little game, and now<br>
   I'm in this steel cage that smells horrible. I remember somebody arguing<br>
   with the other person that, &quot;The bucket was full. The bucket was full.&quot; I<br>
   was hearing that, &quot;You need to empty out this bucket.&quot; I realized that was<br>
   the bathroom, that's why it smelled so horrible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I remember the guy just closing a curtain, and just telling me to,<br>
   &quot;Shut up.&quot; That's when I felt fear for the first time. Even though I was in<br>
   the desert and everything, that's the very, very first time I felt genuine<br>
   fear. I didn't know what was going on. I felt it because my mom felt it.<br>
   She was just hugging me, and that was like the last thing I remember. After<br>
   that I remember just waking up in the apartment complex. In a room, but it<br>
   was completely different, it was somebody else. I guess these people knew<br>
   my mother, because they spoke to her by name and everything. That was one<br>
   of the very first memories.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: One of the very first memories I have of the US, was, I was in a<br>
   truck with my mom—I'm not sure if this was before or after the fact, that<br>
   we had already arrived because we arrived in Phoenix, Arizona—was somebody<br>
   asking my mom, &quot;Have you and your son ate?&quot; I remember my mom telling him,<br>
   &quot;No, but I have a sandwich here and some snacks for him.&quot; He went, &quot;No,<br>
   here, you're in America now, you're in Phoenix now, let's go get a burger.&quot;<br>
   I remember that somebody bought me—I don't know if it was her or him, the<br>
   driver—a kid's meal from MacDonald's. This is when they had... I'm not<br>
   sure…it was like the little hand-held games. I'm not sure, I think it was<br>
   the Rug Rats or something like that. I remember getting that little toy and<br>
   thinking, wow, it's a kid's... It had little fries and a burger, and you<br>
   get a toy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It was the first time I had ever saw that, and I got really happy,<br>
   because I was playing the little game and all that. I thought that was the<br>
   coolest thing in the world. After then, we went into a room... it couldn't<br>
   have been more... It was just a standard living room, but there was<br>
   probably like 50 or 60 people in there. Some of them were sitting and it<br>
   smelled horrible. It obviously wasn't the best place. I guess it was just<br>
   for people waiting for their relatives to go pick them up or something, I'm<br>
   not sure. It was just my mother and I and I remember there was a lady with<br>
   a big pot, and she was just cooking. I'm not sure what she was cooking but<br>
   we went into another room and all I remember hearing was a big slam.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I looked back and it was a cage. It was literally like they<br>
   fashioned a metal door with metal bars between the thresholds of the living<br>
   room from end to end so nobody could get out. Then the windows were the<br>
   same, they had burglar bars so nobody would get out. I was wondering, why<br>
   is this happening? At that time, obviously, you were a kid, you don't<br>
   understand what's going on. First I got fed, I have a little game, and now<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: The reason why my family moved to the US was because both my<br>
   grandfather and my biological fathers struggled with addiction, with<br>
   alcoholism and drug abuse. They were just not very... Mostly my biological<br>
   father, he really wasn't always there, and he was always very violent<br>
   towards my mother. My mother had me when she was 14 years old. When she got<br>
   pregnant everybody decided well, okay, she messed up. She is this, that,<br>
   like very, very taboo. She wasn't really accepted in the family anymore. It<br>
   wasn't so much my family and I moving to the US, it was just my mother and<br>
   I when she was 16 and I was two and a half years old. They weren't really<br>
   interested in what was going on with me or my mother. She just wanted a<br>
   better quality of life for her and for myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: In Mexico at 16 years old, with no type of education past probably<br>
   middle school, she knew she wasn't gonna get very far. I guess she made<br>
   that decision in order to have a better quality of life for her and myself,<br>
   she went on. She was 16, and I don't know how she did it. I don't know the<br>
   details and all that, but she met the right people, or she got in contact<br>
   with the right people, and she went over there. She went to the United<br>
   States. To this day, I still remember a lot of the things, even though I<br>
   was very, very young. It's something that I always tell everybody that I<br>
   meet, it's not just for this interview.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I always remember the bad things that happened or the very... I<br>
   don't know if it's because it had such a big impact in my life and my<br>
   mother's life or just because of how everything was set up. I remember<br>
   everything that happened from start to finish. From the beginning where we<br>
   got picked up, to being in the desert. I still remember eating cereal with<br>
   water. It was... I don't know, it was very, very... I feel like it was...<br>
   it obviously had an impact psychologically, because I still just have a lot<br>
   of anxiety when I'm in certain places that I'm really accustomed to. A two,<br>
   three year old in the middle of the desert, it definitely had to have an<br>
   impact on me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: How old were you when that happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I was two and a half years old, so that's why I'm saying it's very<br>
   odd for me to be able to remember that at a very, very young age. It wasn't<br>
   only that, just even when I was here, when I was two, two and a half, I<br>
   used to remember asking my mom certain memories that I had. She would say,<br>
   &quot;Oh you were one year old, one and a half years old, how did you remember<br>
   that?&quot; It was always very, like a violent, violent memory that I had. It<br>
   was more so like my father being drunk or high or whatever and coming in<br>
   the house. Taking any little money my mom made for the week, in order for<br>
   him to keep on doing what he was doing. Just coming in and just tearing up<br>

   Rodolfo: The reason why my family moved to the US was because both my<br>
   grandfather and my biological fathers struggled with addiction, with<br>
   alcoholism and drug abuse. They were just not very... Mostly my biological<br>
   father, he really wasn't always there, and he was always very violent<br>
   towards my mother. My mother had me when she was 14 years old. When she got<br>
   pregnant everybody decided well, okay, she messed up. She is this, that,<br>
   like very, very taboo. She wasn't really accepted in the family anymore. It<br>
   wasn't so much my family and I moving to the US, it was just my mother and<br>
   I when she was 16 and I was two and a half years old. They weren't really<br>
   interested in what was going on with me or my mother. She just wanted a<br>
   better quality of life for her and for myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: In Mexico at 16 years old, with no type of education past probably<br>
   middle school, she knew she wasn't gonna get very far. I guess she made<br>
   that decision in order to have a better quality of life for her and myself,<br>
   she went on. She was 16, and I don't know how she did it. I don't know the<br>
   details and all that, but she met the right people, or she got in contact<br>
   with the right people, and she went over there. She went to the United<br>
   States. To this day, I still remember a lot of the things, even though I<br>
   was very, very young. It's something that I always tell everybody that I<br>
   meet, it's not just for this interview.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I always remember the bad things that happened or the very... I<br>
   don't know if it's because it had such a big impact in my life and my<br>
   mother's life or just because of how everything was set up. I remember<br>
   everything that happened from start to finish. From the beginning where we<br>
   got picked up, to being in the desert. I still remember eating cereal with<br>
   water. It was... I don't know, it was very, very... I feel like it was...<br>
   it obviously had an impact psychologically, because I still just have a lot<br>
   of anxiety when I'm in certain places that I'm really accustomed to. A two,<br>
   three year old in the middle of the desert, it definitely had to have an<br>
   impact on me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: How old were you when that happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I was two and a half years old, so that's why I'm saying it's very<br>
   odd for me to be able to remember that at a very, very young age. It wasn't<br>
   only that, just even when I was here, when I was two, two and a half, I<br>
   used to remember asking my mom certain memories that I had. She would say,<br>
   &quot;Oh you were one year old, one and a half years old, how did you remember<br>
   that?&quot; It was always very, like a violent, violent memory that I had. It<br>
   was more so like my father being drunk or high or whatever and coming in<br>
   the house. Taking any little money my mom made for the week, in order for<br>
   him to keep on doing what he was doing. Just coming in and just tearing up<br>
   the place.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Sergio: What's one of the first memories you have of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One of the very first memories I have of the US, was, I was in a</br>   truck with my mom—I'm not sure if this was before or after the fact, that</br>   we had already arrived because we arrived in Phoenix, Arizona—was somebody</br>   asking my mom, &quot;Have you and your son ate?&quot; I remember my mom telling him,</br>   &quot;No, but I have a sandwich here and some snacks for him.&quot; He went, &quot;No,</br>   here, you're in America now, you're in Phoenix now, let's go get a burger.&quot;</br>   I remember that somebody bought me—I don't know if it was her or him, the</br>   driver—a kid's meal from MacDonald's. This is when they had... I'm not</br>   sure…it was like the little hand-held games. I'm not sure, I think it was</br>   the Rug Rats or something like that. I remember getting that little toy and</br>   thinking, wow, it's a kid's... It had little fries and a burger, and you</br>   get a toy.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It was the first time I had ever saw that, and I got really happy,</br>   because I was playing the little game and all that. I thought that was the</br>   coolest thing in the world. After then, we went into a room... it couldn't</br>   have been more... It was just a standard living room, but there was</br>   probably like 50 or 60 people in there. Some of them were sitting and it</br>   smelled horrible. It obviously wasn't the best place. I guess it was just</br>   for people waiting for their relatives to go pick them up or something, I'm</br>   not sure. It was just my mother and I and I remember there was a lady with</br>   a big pot, and she was just cooking. I'm not sure what she was cooking but</br>   we went into another room and all I remember hearing was a big slam.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I looked back and it was a cage. It was literally like they</br>   fashioned a metal door with metal bars between the thresholds of the living</br>   room from end to end so nobody could get out. Then the windows were the</br>   same, they had burglar bars so nobody would get out. I was wondering, why</br>   is this happening? At that time, obviously, you were a kid, you don't</br>   understand what's going on. First I got fed, I have a little game, and now</br>   I'm in this steel cage that smells horrible. I remember somebody arguing</br>   with the other person that, &quot;The bucket was full. The bucket was full.&quot; I</br>   was hearing that, &quot;You need to empty out this bucket.&quot; I realized that was</br>   the bathroom, that's why it smelled so horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I remember the guy just closing a curtain, and just telling me to,</br>   &quot;Shut up.&quot; That's when I felt fear for the first time. Even though I was in</br>   the desert and everything, that's the very, very first time I felt genuine</br>   fear. I didn't know what was going on. I felt it because my mom felt it.</br>   She was just hugging me, and that was like the last thing I remember. After</br>   that I remember just waking up in the apartment complex. In a room, but it</br>   was completely different, it was somebody else. I guess these people knew</br>   my mother, because they spoke to her by name and everything. That was one</br>   of the very first memories.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What about school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: School? One of the first memories I have from school, after</br>   Phoenix—I wasn't going to school in Phoenix, actually, I think I even</br>   skipped kindergarten—we moved to Long Beach, California. And the only thing</br>   I remember from school was my mom waking me up probably about four or five</br>   in the morning. The sun wasn't even out yet, and she would walk me to this</br>   random lady's house. Actually, she wasn't random, but she was just some</br>   lady I didn't know. There was two other kids there, and I would be in</br>   uniform. That was the first time I actually wore a uniform to go to school.</br>   I was there, but I didn't really remember that much. When we moved to</br>   Chicago, that's when everything changed.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was a little bit older. I remember I went to Jordan Elementary.</br>   It was in the North side of Chicago. We were there for a very brief moment,</br>   because then we moved to Evanston. Evanston was literally right next to</br>   Chicago. The school I was attending was called Orrington Elementary. The</br>   reason why we moved, once again, is because she wanted a better quality of</br>   life for me. Where I was at, it was all English, there was no Spanish.</br>   Obviously, there were Hispanic kids who already spoke English, but there</br>   wasn't... She, herself didn't know English, so how could she teach me, so</br>   how could I be integrated into a school that doesn't even accommodate for</br>   individuals or kids who don't know English?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: She moved schools, although we were still in Chicago because we</br>   needed... what was it? Proof of residency. We lived out of district, and</br>   she would get fined or I wouldn't be able to go to school there. The point</br>   is I went to school to Orrington Elementary. The program was called the TWI</br>   (Two Way Immersion). It was a bilingual program and that's where I learned</br>   my English, that school. Friends and everything. I feel as though like,</br>   that's why I learned my English so well, because I really, really wanted to</br>   learn it. I always heard kids at the park or at the store, at Target, at</br>   Jewels, or whatever and everybody spoke English, right? I just felt</br>   fascinated, I was intrigued by it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It was a whole different language that I didn't know, and I wanted</br>   to master it. I wanted to be able to talk as they spoke, or talk as they</br>   talked. School was a very cool experience. I always had a lot of friends,</br>   and I was always the life of the classroom. I wasn't probably the best</br>   behaved kid, but I was always integrated in to what was going on with the</br>   school.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you remember any teachers or people?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, absolutely. Ms. Mule, Ms. Mule was my second or third grade</br>   teacher, I'm not sure which one it was. She was awesome, she always help me</br>   out with the English, always. Even in parent teacher conferences, she would</br>   literally always talk to my mom as if she'd be really interested. She would</br>   show genuine interest in what was going on with, not just me, but with the</br>   Hispanic kids. Kids who had trouble with English or weren't doing the best</br>   academically. She always would tell me, &quot;Don't worry, you're gonna get it.</br>   You're gonna learn it.&quot; She had such a big heart.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Still even, my mother and I still talk about the teacher to this</br>   point in time. She tells me, &quot;I remember Ms. Mule and she used to use hand</br>   gestures. She would always be like, 'Yeah, for this or for that.'&quot; Even</br>   though I knew I wasn't the smartest or the most best behaved kid, she would</br>   always have that initiative to get us there. Get us to that point. Yeah,</br>   that was one of my favorite teachers. Man, I value that so much actually</br>   now. I miss that teacher. Another teacher was in fifth grade, his name was</br>   Mr. Stoom. He was Argentinian, he was from Argentina. He was another great</br>   teacher. He always told us, &quot;Don't ever forget where you came from. Your</br>   roots are who you are, even though you all are coming from different parts</br>   of the world, don't ever forget who you are and where you come from.&quot;</br>   That's one of the biggest things right now, I'm kind of ashamed of.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm not, because I was so... What do they say, &quot;Americanized.&quot; In</br>   Chicago, I was so in America. I never dedicated the time to open a book or</br>   even Google something of my home country. Now that I get here, I don't know</br>   what is going on. Just barely a couple of months ago, I found out Mexico is</br>   a third-world country. I didn't know that. I go to Polanco Fendi, Prado,</br>   Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton boutiques. To me, that's not a third world</br>   country. Yeah, that teacher was the one who started opening my eyes up more</br>   to my surroundings.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Have you always known that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Have I always known that I was undocumented? When I was younger,</br>   when my mother and I arrived to Chicago, I remember my aunts telling her,</br>   &quot;Don't go out that much. Stay indoors, because if they see you, they can</br>   take you.&quot; I'm at a very young age, at that point, I think I was six or</br>   seven. Adults are talking in the room and you hear them tell your mom,</br>   &quot;Don't go out that much. If they see you out there, they're gonna grab</br>   you.&quot; I thought like, “Whoa, who's gonna grab us, who's gonna grab mom?” I</br>   didn't understand the concept of the legal side of migration. Why we're not</br>   supposed to be here. I'd never quite fully understood why I wasn't supposed</br>   to be there.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Until finally, one time my stepdad, he told me, &quot;You need to go to</br>   school and do everything that you need to do, because we're not supposed to</br>   be here.&quot; I asked him, &quot;Why not, why can't we be here?&quot; He told me, &quot;We're</br>   immigrants, we come from a different country. You weren't born here, I</br>   wasn't born here, and this isn't our country. People don't want us here</br>   because they say we take their jobs. Or they have a preconceived image of</br>   what an immigrant is.&quot; I still didn't understand it yet, I didn't know why.</br>   You go to work, you pay your taxes, you do everything as my American</br>   parent's friends do.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Everybody... I go to their house and, yeah, they have big ‘ol</br>   houses and mansions and stuff like that, but at the end of the day, they go</br>   to work, they have a job. I don't see you out here stealing or doing</br>   anything, you're not causing any harm. Why can't we be here? He told us,</br>   &quot;Well, I mean, that's just the way things are.&quot; I didn't understand that</br>   until obviously I grew up and then I found that out. When I finally really,</br>   really understood what an immigrant was or why I was an immigrant, it was</br>   the day that—I was in a debate team in my middle school. We won, in the</br>   whole district we won. We won the top prize. We went... Not national, I</br>   think it was... Yeah, nationwide, we were supposed to go to DC.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: We were supposed to go to DC. I remember this then and it broke my</br>   heart, so I want to even cry now [Emotional]. Damn. I asked my mom, &quot;Can I</br>   go?&quot; She's like, &quot;No you can't.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because you can't fly.&quot;</br>   I'm like, &quot;Why can't I fly?&quot; She said, &quot;Because you don't have a state ID,</br>   you're not from here.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Damn.&quot; Then, I think she told the</br>   school... She made something up, but that's when I finally knew it. Like,</br>   &quot;Damn, this shit is real, this is real.&quot; Then after that I just, &quot;Okay,</br>   whatever, I'm just gonna see where this takes us.&quot; Yeah, that's around the</br>   time I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you ever work in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I worked all the time, I never stopped. One of the first</br>   jobs I had…My uncle worked at a restaurant called, Baker's Square in</br>   Chicago. It was on the corner of Tui and Pratt. I really, really, really</br>   wanted—I think I was in fifth or sixth grade—a phone. I wanted a phone,</br>   it’s called the Psychic Slide. Phones used to flip, but this one slides. I</br>   wasn't gonna ask my mom for it, so I asked my uncle. &quot;Hey man, I know you</br>   work at Baker's Square and I know around the holiday season it gets really</br>   busy. Can I help you? Can I go?&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, yeah, if you want.&quot; I</br>   used to wake up like 3:00 in the morning, and I used to go and help him</br>   out. After that, I really liked making money and I really liked dressing</br>   nice, I liked having my nice haircut or whatever. My very, very first job</br>   was in Wilmette, Illinois. I was a caddie. Yeah, and then—</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: On the golf course?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: On the golf course, yeah. Wilmette Golf Course actually. I</br>   remember I was always the first one there. They used to choose us, when</br>   everybody got there, &quot;Okay, you come with me, you come with me.&quot; I used to</br>   always go there and there was a gentleman by the name of... Man, I forgot</br>   his name. Like the President, Gerald Ford, that was his name Gerald Ford!</br>   The only reason I remembered was because of the President. He used to</br>   always get there around the same time I got there. He finally asked me, &quot;Do</br>   you want to be my personal caddie? I don't want you working anymore with</br>   all these other kids, because nobody wants to work. Do you want to be my</br>   personal caddie?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, absolutely.&quot; It was going really, really</br>   well and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I got to high school, I had a number of jobs. I worked at Subway,</br>   I worked at Chili's, I worked at... What was it? Outback Steak House, but</br>   then I finally just got to the Cheesecake Factory, and that's where I</br>   stayed the remainder of my time. The remainder of my time I stayed there,</br>   and I started from the busboy and I finally ended up being a bartender. One</br>   of the head bartenders, one of the head servers, they used to pay-out</br>   people and everything. Obviously, I didn't have my social or anything, but</br>   I was a little bit older than what I really was. When I first got there,</br>   when I first, first started working I think I was like 14. Obviously you</br>   can't work that young, I think actually, I was 18, at 14.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I didn't see it as anything bad. I knew that if I got caught with</br>   my fake ID and my fake social security card I'd get in trouble, but that's</br>   why we're there, that's why we worked. I didn't get a fake ID to go party</br>   or go get into clubs or bars or anything. The main purpose of it was for me</br>   to be able to get a job, and so my mom wouldn't have to work all those</br>   hours that she used to work. She used to work at a Burger King, overnight.</br>   I used to barely see her, and I didn't want that anymore. I told her, &quot;You</br>   don't have to work that much if I start working. We can help each other</br>   out, we can, we're a team.” It was only my mother and I until I turned 14,</br>   when she met my stepdad. All throughout that, it was just my mother and I.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: After your mom told you couldn't go on that trip, how did that</br>   affect the way you were involved in school, the things you wanted to do,</br>   did that change? Is there anything that you...?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I didn't put as much effort as I did anymore. I knew, at the end</br>   of the day, I'm not eligible for scholarships. I don't get any aid, I don't</br>   get anything. In my mind I thought, “Man, what's the point of really</br>   working hard in school if at the end of the day, I'm not gonna get any</br>   help?” My mom is having to work to put me through college. No, I don't want</br>   this, so I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna give her what she</br>   wants, my diploma, my high school diploma. From then on, if I want to do</br>   something, it'll be by my own hand, out of my own pocket. I didn't want her</br>   to... Not that I was a burden or anything, my objective was for her not to</br>   work that much. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: After she told me that, I'm like, &quot;Well, okay, what's the point of</br>   really working hard and putting your best effort into school if, in my</br>   position, I won't be able to surpass US citizens.&quot; Then the aspect of</br>   financial aid, or any aid at all, I'm not gonna have any of that. I tried</br>   it with the fake social, but obviously it didn't go through. Nothing</br>   happened. Yeah, it changed a lot. It changed the way I viewed everything</br>   around me. Like, spring break all my friends would go certain places out of</br>   the country, and I used to get invited and, &quot;No, I can't go man, my family</br>   doesn't think...&quot; It would always have to be lie after lie after lie. I</br>   didn't want to... for one, I always had that idea of like my mom and my</br>   family always told me, &quot;Don't ever tell anybody you're an immigrant. If</br>   somebody has that knowledge they can do you harm. They can take you away</br>   from here, they can take us away from each other.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm seeing it now, with the families going across the border, and</br>   them being separated. I didn't understand it at the time, and man, now I do</br>   understand it. I didn't know how it really was until I finally got put in</br>   handcuffs and got shipped to an immigration facility.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What do you think you would have wanted or end up being before you</br>   found out? What kind of things... Like you were on debate team that was—</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I wanted to be a lawyer, man, that's what I wanted to be. That's</br>   what I wanted to be, a lawyer. It's funny, because when I was younger I</br>   wanted to be a lawyer. Then after that I'm like, &quot;I want to be an</br>   immigration lawyer, that's what I want to be now. I want to be an</br>   immigration lawyer.” I was already on the right track to being a lawyer,</br>   but then when that happened, it really opened my eyes more to, &quot;Okay, let's</br>   help my people.&quot; I didn't realize... I know individuals over there who are</br>   citizens, and they're panhandling because they want to. They're on their</br>   own addiction or for whatever reason right? Or people who are just living</br>   off the government, but then I see some of my family members, or my</br>   friends’ family members and they're not citizens but they have businesses.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They have a business, they have trucks, they have houses, they're</br>   great. They're not living off the Government, they're not asking for a</br>   handout. They're living better than what a citizen is living. It's all</br>   about how much work you put in, right? If you hang around people who don't</br>   want to do anything, then you're not gonna do anything. I remember Gerald</br>   Ford always told me that. He was like, &quot;If you want to be a millionaire,</br>   hang around millionaires. If you want to be successful, hang around people</br>   who do successful things, but if you want to keep doing what you're doing,</br>   and just be a little caddie or whatever, stay here. Stay here and maybe one</br>   day you'll do something else.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: He was very blunt in that aspect like, &quot;Always do a good job. I</br>   don't care if you're a shit-shoveler, you're gonna be the best shit</br>   shoveler there is.” That always stuck to me, that's why whatever I do, it's</br>   always been 100%.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Can I speak? I'm Anita, I'm the director of this project.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm really pleased to meet you—</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Likewise.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm amazed at your incredible story. When you talked about the trip</br>   to DC, the debate club, and you got very sad—</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... what made you sad, and did it make you feeling... Do you</br>   remember what your feelings were as you sort of found that all these</br>   options were gone to you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Well, it was just mixed emotions. I felt sad because I contributed</br>   to the team a lot. I wasn't just there, and it made me sad because I wasn't</br>   going to be able be with my friends, my teammates. It also made me mad</br>   because all my life, all my short period, my whole time here in Chicago or</br>   whatever, I don't think I've done anything bad. Why shouldn't I have the</br>   privilege to go if I put in the same work as they did? Only because I don't</br>   have a social security number or a document that lets me buy a plane ticket</br>   and go over there? I think about it in a different—at the same time, I was</br>   a little kid too—I just cried a lot. That night I just cried a lot because</br>   I knew I wasn't gonna go. My mom spoke to the, I'm not sure what my mom</br>   told her, but see, I don't think she told her that we're undocumented, and</br>   I can't fly.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I just remember that night feeling very sad, very sad, but</br>   then it turned into anger. It was like, &quot;Man, why can't I?&quot; It was always</br>   just that, &quot;Why can't I? I put in the same work, and just because I wasn't</br>   born here, I can't fly?&quot; I even looked into bus routes and everything to DC</br>   and stuff like that, but my mom was like, &quot;No, you're crazy, you can't go</br>   alone.&quot; She worked and everything, I just felt sad, mostly sad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did Gerald Ford know you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: No, Gerald Ford didn't know I was undocumented, no. I was still</br>   very young at that point. My mother and my family always told me, &quot;Don't</br>   let anybody know you're undocumented.” If somebody finds out, for whatever</br>   reason, there's some people who just are plain out racist or don't want</br>   people like me in the States. Sometimes they just do things to... I don't</br>   know. That's what I understood and that's what I took in and that's what I</br>   applied to my life. It's like living a secret, it was like living a second</br>   life or whatever. It’s like, &quot;Oh shit, why do I have to lie, why?&quot; I guess</br>   it's neither here nor there now, right? I'm here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That must have been incredibly difficult. I know personally, because</br>   I've had to keep secrets.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I guess it's one of those things where you think it's never</br>   really gonna affect you, until you're in the back of the DHS, the</br>   Department of Homeland Security, van. You're next to a whole bunch of</br>   people you never met, and they're also in the same position. Some don't</br>   even speak English. You don't really understand how immediately it can</br>   affect you until it affects you. I never thought it would affect me. Okay,</br>   well I mean, I'm working, I'm going to school—I'm in high school—I'm doing</br>   this, this and that. Some of my friends who are students already dropped</br>   out. Did everything, they’ve already gone to prison and back and</br>   everything, and they haven't even hit their 21st birthday.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I'm still good, I'm still good. I may not be a straight A</br>   student or anything, but hey man, I'm still here! Why can't I have the same</br>   privilege as you all do? Why can't I get my license? You know how happy I</br>   was when I got my license here, damn. I love to drive, that's one of my</br>   passions. Always, always, always I love to drive. I couldn't get my license</br>   over there. I remember even in high school in drivers ed, I knew what the</br>   answer was, but I asked my mom, “Hey mom, can I apply for drivers ed, so I</br>   can get my license? “She was like, &quot;You know you can't get your license.&quot;</br>   Again, one of the primary things, I’m like damn, I'm just not gonna be able</br>   to drive all my life? Or if I do drive and I get pulled over—as a matter of</br>   fact, that's the reason why I got deported, driving without a valid drivers</br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I never got why the paper said, &quot;Driving on a suspended license.&quot;</br>   I would always ask them, &quot;If I don't have a license, why is it suspended?&quot;</br>   They just told me, &quot;Because you have a drivers license number, but you</br>   don't have a drivers license? I'm like, &quot;Okay, so if I have a drivers</br>   license number, why can't I get my drivers license?&quot; &quot;You don't have the</br>   proper documentation.&quot; I'm like, &quot;But I have my...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One day I thought, “Well why don't I just grab the driver license</br>   number and have somebody make me a fake drivers license, and put the</br>   drivers license on there?” But see, if I get caught with it, now I'm in</br>   more trouble, and now I'm seen as a real criminal, because now I'm going</br>   around the system once again. That's why we don't want you here, because</br>   you're gonna do things like that. [Exhale] I haven't talked about this in a</br>   while. It just makes me want to…I don’t know.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You know that was different from a lot of other people in high</br>   school probably too.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, it was a big difference for my friends and I, because they</br>   all got their license, they all were able to get their ID and everything.</br>   And I wasn't able to do it. Then when I was asked, &quot;Hey man, why don't you</br>   get your license?&quot; Only some of my very, very close friends—probably like</br>   two friends—knew that I wasn't documented. Then, when we spoke about it</br>   amongst other friends, they knew that it was like another secret you had to</br>   keep. Yeah, it was different with other kid. Sometimes I'll be even</br>   jealous, because I'm like, &quot;Damn, if only I had been born a couple of miles</br>   North of the border, or West of the border, or whatever, I could be in your</br>   position.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm like, &quot;Why, why do I have to feel that way man? I'm a good</br>   person. I've made mistakes and things like that but hey man...” Nah, don't</br>   think that way you know? Just because you don't have a visa that says</br>   you're from America, doesn’t mean you can't do the same things. What, at 15</br>   I bought my first car by myself. At 16, I got my first ticket, my first</br>   pull over. But why? Because I was coming home from work. That's when I was</br>   already working at Chili's—I was working in Schofield, Illinois at Chili's.</br>   You know restaurant jobs, you got to work late. At that time in the</br>   suburbs, there's not much transportation short of a cab ride. But I'm not</br>   gonna be wasting money every day, so that's why I bought my car.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: That's what happened, that's really why they got me. I remember</br>   when I was in Court they said, &quot;He has accumulated since he was 15. Since</br>   he was 15 he accumulated a lot of driving tickets. He is dangerous to the</br>   road.&quot; I'm like, &quot;What? [Incredulous]. All my tickets are because you guys</br>   pull me over. It was late at night, I was the only car on the road. I mean,</br>   obviously, if a police officer tails you for more than two miles, you're</br>   gonna do something wrong in their eyes, right?” That's just what happened.</br>   I kept on driving, why? Because I went to school and I went to work, and</br>   it's just easier, it's just more convenient to drive your car that you paid</br>   for, than to go through the hassle of the CTA—the CTA is the Chicago</br>   Transit Authority.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, that's the way it was, but I always saw it as, “Man, don't</br>   let that affect you.” But, hey man, it affected me all right? If I didn't</br>   drive, I would probably still be over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did they give you tickets for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Driving with no valid drivers license. Then after two or three</br>   time it turns into an aggravated... No, sorry, it turns into a felony. It's</br>   just the same kind, but now it's a felony instead of a misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They just pulled you over because they saw that... Why did they pull</br>   you over?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One of the first times was because I had a busted taillight. I</br>   didn't realize that the lightbulb had gone out. Then after that...Once</br>   again, I didn't live in the best place around town, so police would always</br>   be around. I guess they just saw me and they would always just get behind</br>   me. It wasn't just me, it was other friends. Even when I would be with</br>   other coworkers, it would happen the same way. In Rogers Park, by Evanston,</br>   and even in Wrigleyville, a whole bunch of places, if it's late at night</br>   and they just see one or two individuals, especially Hispanic or</br>   African-American, they're gonna see what's going on.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They're gonna want to see what's going on. That's what happened,</br>   because I literally would ask them, &quot;Why did you pull me over?&quot; &quot;Improper</br>   lane usage.&quot; All my tickets improper lane usage, failed to use turn signal.</br>   It was really aggravating because it was like, “Man bro, you see me with my</br>   work uniform on, you see the food right next to me. Literally, here is my</br>   work ID, this is where I work, and I'm coming from work. Please just let me</br>   go home.&quot; &quot;Please step out of the car.&quot; Impound the car, or, I'm not gonna</br>   lie, some of the times that I did get pulled over sometimes they just let</br>   me leave the car, or they had me call somebody with a license, but that was</br>   very, very rare that would happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of those occasions immigration never picked, and never gave them to</br>   them... Chicago's a sanctuary city.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: No, Chicago's a sanctuary city, yeah. That's why I don't</br>   understand why I was picked up. The day I got picked up, I was driving to</br>   work. I parked my car and out of nowhere a Ford truck, it was unmarked</br>   truck, they didn't even have the DHS seal on it. I didn't understand it,</br>   because I even told them all, &quot;Isn't this a sanctuary city? Can you guys do</br>   this, is this against my Constitutional rights? I'm not that sure, not that</br>   well-educated in that aspect of it, but here, give me a book, I'll read it</br>   and I'll tell you what it is. I'm not stupid bro.&quot; That's why they</br>   separated me from the other people I was with, because it wasn't only</br>   Mexicans that I was with. I was with somebody from... I was with two</br>   Somalians.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They were brothers actually, two Somalians. I told everybody,</br>   &quot;Man, don't sign anything, don't talk, don't say anything. Just tell them</br>   you want a lawyer and that's it.” I remember they told me, &quot;Shut up,&quot; and</br>   they put me in a different cell, because I kept on telling everybody not to</br>   sign anything. Yeah, that's what I didn't understand—I didn't understand</br>   how they were able to go get me, but as I understood then and now,</br>   obviously federal laws are always gonna trump state laws. That's in the</br>   door, that's why you still see the dispensary in Colorado get raided,</br>   because it's a federal offense, and not state offense. I was literally a</br>   federal walking broken law.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's sad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: That's the way I saw it. Even though I'm cool, I'm all right and</br>   in Chicago, a sanctuary, but that's only state. They can come and just tear</br>   the place up into whatever they want because they're the government. And we</br>   can't do anything about it because I'm not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm gonna have to go in another room, can we pause for a second?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, after you were detained, how was your experience? What</br>   happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: After I was detained, I've got to say my experience going through</br>   the immigration, it was something I had never experienced in my life. I</br>   mean, I was never deprived of my freedom. And it wasn't because I committed</br>   an actual crime. I didn't go and take somebody's laptop, or I didn't go</br>   into a store with a loaded gun and ask for money. No, it was one of the</br>   most horrible experiences I've ever been through. It was more their idea of</br>   housing me because I'm not from there or it was...</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: [Pause]. I remember when I first got picked up, they took me to</br>   Wisconsin—I'm sorry, they took me to Rock Island, Illinois—for processing.</br>   That was the processing center.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They took my fingerprint and my name, first and last name and</br>   everything. Right? So I wasn't… I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. They</br>   took my name and everything, right? But then they had a form in front of me</br>   and they told me here, sign here and you know you'll be all set. And I</br>   asked them, “Well here, give me a second, let me read it.” And there was</br>   another person, right? Because it was a desk like this one. It was four</br>   seats this way with the divider being the computer, the fingerprint scanner</br>   and a camera, like a little Nikon camera, simple camera. And I told</br>   everybody— I was the only one who spoke English or perfect English at</br>   that—&quot;Hey man, don't sign anything at all until you know what you're</br>   signing because you don't know what you're signing. For all you know you're</br>   signing your liver away. So, just don't sign anything.” And the guy told</br>   me, “Hey man, shut your mouth. We're talking to you; we're not talking to</br>   them. I'm talking to you. Don't be a hero or don't be a jailhouse lawyer.”</br>   I'm like, “A jailhouse lawyer? I'm not in jail.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And they told me, “Just sign here.” I'm like, “No, I'm not going</br>   to sign it.” And I started reading through it, and it basically everything</br>   that it said was, “I waive my right to an appeal. I waive my right to any</br>   formal hearing. Basically, deport me as soon as possible.” And I'm like,</br>   “So you're telling me that without explaining to me what's going on or what</br>   this form entails, you're just going to have me sign it?”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Because they told me, “We're not going to let you speak to your</br>   family and you're not going to see your family for a long time if you don't</br>   sign this because you're breaking some law or whatever.” Because they even</br>   showed me little papers saying, if you state that you're a US citizen it's</br>   a federal crime punishable by between—I think it was like—three to seven</br>   years in federal prison.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Now, I'm not sure if that was another one of their little tactics</br>   or whatever, but nonetheless didn't let it scare me, I didn't let it affect</br>   me. I'm like, “Okay cool, that's great man, I'm not going to sign this. I</br>   need to go in front of a proper hearing and a judge. I want to bond set.</br>   Because I know, well, I may not know my rights a hundred percent, but I</br>   know that I'm, I'm entitled to a bond or at least a hearing for a bond.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And they told me, “Wait right here.” And then they went to go get</br>   a supervisor, and the supervisor spoke to me in private and he gave me</br>   another form and he was like, “Okay, you want a proper hearing? Sign here.”</br>   And I read it and, okay here, then like, man, this is what it is? It took</br>   me getting loud with you. I was a bit belligerent, I'm not going to lie to</br>   you tell you I was the best, as they called me, “detainee.” But I'm going</br>   to fight for my home. I understand I was born in Mexico, but Chicago's my</br>   home, it's my land, that's where I'm from. And whatever I can do to stay</br>   there, I'd be okay.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And so, yeah, that's what it was. But it took me probably a good,</br>   five months before I could see a judge.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were in detention that whole time?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was in detention. I was in a detention center for five months.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Before seeing the judge?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Before seeing the judge. And it wasn't even a formal hearing I</br>   did. It was over the internet and the monitors, surprisingly that day, did</br>   not work. So, all I heard was voices and I told them “No, I want a proper</br>   hearing. I can't see the judge. For all I know there's a guy in the next</br>   room talking to me and there's no judge.” “Okay, well you're going to have</br>   to wait on a whole another six months.” And I'm not going to lie to you,</br>   those detention centers aren't all that pretty, you know what I mean?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I just didn't want to be locked up anymore. That, honestly, that</br>   scared me. I didn't want to do another whole six months. By that point, I</br>   would've done a year just to go see one judge for a bond. Finally, I said,</br>   “Yeah, you know what? Yeah, I want one. I'll take the six months, give me</br>   the six months. Just so I can see a judge.” Surprisingly, there was another</br>   court hearing, I think, a month from then. So, I finally got to see the</br>   judge, but they set the bond at $50,000. And I don't have a $50,000, my</br>   family doesn't have $50,000. So, I sat there. I sat the two and a half</br>   years because I wanted to fight it. Every possible angle that I could</br>   probably touch, I tried it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm a victim of sexual abuse in the United States and there was a</br>   police report made and everything. And I've also been a victim of gang</br>   violence. I was never, you can check my background and everything. I was</br>   never into gangs or anything, but around the area I lived in there was a</br>   bunch of gangs and... I was beat up two or three times bad just by walking</br>   home. And it was all documented, I had police reports and everything. And</br>   because of that I was in therapy for while. My mother sought out a help</br>   from a psychiatrist because of the sexual abuse I had as a child in</br>   California, as a matter of fact.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I took Risperdal and a Ritalin, Risperdal for the anxiety and the</br>   Ritalin and for the ADHD. So, we tried everything. The mental health side,</br>   the mental health asylum, everything. But it was just going to take longer</br>   and longer and longer and I was tired of it. I didn't want to be locked up</br>   anymore. So, finally I just told my mom, “You know what man, that's it, I'm</br>   done. I don't want to do this anymore.” She asked me, “Is this what you</br>   want to do?” And I told her, “Yeah.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: She told me, “You know what? I'd much rather see you over there</br>   and be free then not being able to see you here at all.” Because there was</br>   a lot of people that went to go visit their loved ones and they used to get</br>   picked up. Sometimes they wouldn't even let you see your loved ones and</br>   right away ask you for your identification, your social security card, your</br>   nationality and everything and they would get picked up.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I always told my mom, “Don't ever come visit me. Don't ever</br>   come visit me because if you do, chances are they're going to take you</br>   too.” And you know, that would always break my heart because I would want</br>   to see my mom. I'd want to see my dad and everything, but I wasn't able to.</br>   So, that experience was just horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When you were in the detention center what were the conditions? Did</br>   you have access the medicine you needed? Did you have access to food and</br>   water?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: The company that made the jail was called GEO Corp and they were</br>   actually, I'm not going to lie to you, they actually were pretty good,</br>   health-wise, not so much security-wise. A lot of things would happen in</br>   there that definitely shouldn't have ever happened. But with the food and</br>   everything, it was good. In my opinion it was because of the company. I</br>   feel as though if it was up to the government... Thank God it was an</br>   independent company that was hired by DHS as opposed to if DHS were to make</br>   their own jail, I feel they would be completely different.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It was [Pause] a pleasantly... there's no way to describe it, it</br>   was bad. It was bad, but for what it was I guess it was okay. I don't see</br>   there being an in-between or any pretty way to paint that picture as to how</br>   good or bad it was in there. Because at the end of the day you're deprived</br>   of your freedom. You can't just pick up the phone whenever you want and</br>   call your loved ones because you've got to pay for that too. You got pay</br>   for that. And if you want to take a shower, you have to buy your soap,</br>   right? You've got to buy it yourself, you've got to buy everything. And now</br>   you're becoming a liability for your family, you're becoming another bill.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: You're becoming another bill and that's what I didn't want. So,</br>   that's why I started working. And now, older, I'm becoming another bill.</br>   So, I don't get it. You're taking us away from the jobs that we have and</br>   everything. You know? So, take us back to our country. And I'm not sure if</br>   it this is a fact or not, but I was reading when I first got in here, there</br>   was a time where there wasn't enough field workers for, I think,</br>   avocado—or, not avocado, I think it was oranges or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I remember me saying, “Well, there goes all the deportees.</br>   There goes all the people you guys deported. Where are the people that were</br>   so outraged because we took your jobs? Go ahead, there you go. There are a</br>   lot of vacancies, making these open for those jobs, go ahead, man. All</br>   yours buddy, knock yourself out.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But nobody wants to work those jobs, right? You see what I'm</br>   saying though, right?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Definitely. So, how do you feel, do you feel like American…?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I don't want to say I feel like American. Spiritually, me myself,</br>   as an individual, I feel like now that I've been in Mexico and been living</br>   the real life of a real life Mexican—because man, it's hard out here, you</br>   know?—I feel like if I say I'm American, I feel like I'm betraying who I</br>   am. Because I have American… Yes, I'm from... Because even then I can't</br>   even say I'm American cause I'm not from there, that's why I'm here, right?</br>   But the way I feel, yeah, I guess I am what they call me here, el gabacho,</br>   the American, the white boy. Do I feel it? I feel it only because I miss my</br>   home and that's what I want to be in order to be okay over there. I mean,</br>   if that's what I have to be in order to be okay over there and then, okay,</br>   yeah, I'm American.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But when I'm amongst individuals, Mexicans here and everything, my</br>   own people, I'm a Mexican. It still takes me a little while for me to be</br>   able to really integrate myself because to this point, to this day, I still</br>   have trouble expressing myself 100% in Spanish. I always try to better my</br>   Spanish, but it gets to the point where sometimes I can't fully express the</br>   way I feel at times.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: So, I speak in English but then you can't understand me in English</br>   because you speak all Spanish. So, those are the times when I really truly</br>   do feel American more than I feel Mexican. Because if I can't voice and</br>   express my true feelings in my native tongue then that's—my native tongue</br>   is English.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: So, you know what? Now that you do mention it, yeah, I feel more</br>   American now than I do Mexican and it's kind of mixed feelings. Because I'm</br>   trying to forget everything that I was over, that was going on over there,</br>   that I lived over there. But it's hard because I want to go back, I want to</br>   be able to punch in at Cheesecake Factory, and I want to be able to come</br>   home and just be with my family. But yeah, I do feel more American than I</br>   do Mexican and I'm not ashamed to say that's who I am. Short of being born</br>   over there, I'm from over there.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What was your experience when you got back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: My experience when I first arrived in Mexico, when I first got</br>   back in Mexico was surreal, it was a blur. I'm terribly afraid of heights.</br>   That's my fear. Not so much anymore but yeah, heights are not my thing. I</br>   remember being on the plane and it taking a turn, and I remember seeing all</br>   the buildings and I saw everything and I even scooted up in front of my</br>   seat to see and it's like I completely forgot that I was afraid of heights.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I felt happy and I don't know why. I don't know if it was</br>   because I was finally going to be free. And before it turned, before they</br>   told all the people, all the agents or the officials to sit down, they took</br>   the handcuffs off and they took the shackles off and I just, I'm like,</br>   “Whoa, okay, this shit is real. This is real.” And it did that turn and we</br>   finally got down and I saw the... we were passing by all hangars, the</br>   military hangar, the presidential hangar, certain company's hangars and</br>   whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Got off the plane, and I just remember looking back and looking at</br>   my hands and not seeing handcuffs or a police officer right next to me and</br>   I felt happy. But then I got on the phone and I called my mom and she was</br>   just happy that I was out and everything. She started crying and I then</br>   started crying too but then... that was just very mixed emotions. And the</br>   first couple of months, they were all right until I started figuring out</br>   that the individuals who are my family, as a matter of fact, who are</br>   supposed to help me out here were just after the money.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I feel like somebody's first experience or first impression or</br>   how they've gone about being in Mexico has to do greatly with their support</br>   system in Mexico. And unfortunately, I had the shorter end of the stick. I</br>   felt like I needed to pass by the things I needed to pass in order for me</br>   to get to the point where I am right now in this very point in time, in</br>   this chair, wearing these clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It wasn't the most prettiest thing. I was homeless for a while. I</br>   didn't have a house. My house was a 2016 Nissan Versa and that's only</br>   because I took a job as an Uber driver and it wasn't even my car, it was</br>   somebody else's. But I couldn't tell that guy it wasn't my car because he</br>   probably wouldn't even have let me keep driving. So, my first, my initial</br>   experience in Mexico was bad, it was bad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was lied to, I was deceived, I was stolen from. It's like every</br>   little turn it was always a smack in the head or something. But little by</br>   little I started getting acclimated to everything that was going on. How I</br>   should go about moving in certain areas or how I should talk, how I should</br>   move. Better yet, how to adapt to certain situations.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did the Mexican government provide help in that transition?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: The Mexican government, they provided some help. They provided 50</br>   pesos when I first got here. And they just give me a whole bunch of</br>   pamphlets of school and housing, right? But I feel as though independent</br>   organizations were the ones who ultimately would have helped me a lot more.</br>   When I first got off the plane, they told me about all the resources, all</br>   the help, all the things that their company or their organization did for</br>   other people, deportees. So, I feel like independent organizations would</br>   have helped me more than the Mexican government.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: What can the Mexican government do to help deportees?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Well, I mean, look, when I first got here, apart from them giving</br>   me 50 pesos... In my opinion, the Mexican government can be more supportive</br>   in having—I don't know,—what I was thinking is probably a fund, you know?</br>   Or maybe a fund or some type of little packet. Not saying that we all are</br>   entitled to it, but it'd be good to get here and have a little bit of money</br>   or a place for yourself, or right away giving out jobs or something like</br>   that. I'm not saying that the Mexico City doesn't have jobs for a bilingual</br>   speaker or bilingual people but it's through third party organizations,</br>   outsourcing and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But if the Mexican government really do want to help then that</br>   would be my suggestion. More jobs, more jobs for people like us. And not</br>   just for people us more so, but that would help out everybody else. Or</br>   simply, when I got here maybe there'd be a little fund that everybody gets,</br>   a certain amount of money to start their own business. Because I did hear</br>   about something like that. That there are help for people that want to</br>   start their business, especially if you're deportees.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Now I still haven't been pointed towards the right direction as to</br>   how to go about doing that. I mean, I've looked for help but I always come</br>   to a dead end. And it varies from city to city. Because somebody who I was</br>   with in the detention center—we left the same day and everything—but he's</br>   from Monterey and he actually he actually got 30,000 pesos from the Mexican</br>   government. I'm not sure what branch it was from or where exactly it came</br>   from, but he showed me everything. He proved it to me, so I know there is</br>   help, but I feel like there is not that much awareness.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I feel like, obviously because of the corruption or anything they</br>   don't want to help us because they much rather keep that money for</br>   themselves then to give it out. So, I feel like more awareness as well. If</br>   there is that help, then let us know. Let us know we have that help. Let us</br>   know you are there and we can help. Not just that we've come here from a</br>   different country and now go ahead, do whatever you can. No, I mean, just</br>   help us out too.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: I'm just wrapping up. Why do you think so many people from Mexico</br>   have a negative perception of returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Because of what their family members tell them. And the reason why</br>   returning deportees have a bad perception or a bad idea or a bad image of</br>   why they shouldn't come back is because well, in the first place, their</br>   family... Every individual has their own story, right? Obviously, that</br>   individual's family has told them the story of why they moved to America.</br>   And if they themselves, if their own family didn't want to live here, that</br>   in its own instills fear in them.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I mean, we're humans, right? We fear the unknown. We fear what we</br>   don't know, especially we fear change. We're creatures of habit. If you</br>   take me out of my element, if you took me out of Chicago, I'm like, “Shit,</br>   I don't know what's going on man.” I didn't know I couldn't walk after I</br>   paid my tacos. I didn't know I had to give back [inaudible 00:25:14], the</br>   glass bottle. I didn't know that. I didn't know I had to pay five pesos if</br>   I want to use the bathroom around here.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: My family painted me a picture of here that it was going to be</br>   horrible. Because that's what they lived, that's what they know. That's the</br>   reason why they moved. Like, “Hey man, living over there is going to be</br>   horrible. Don't go over there, fight the case, stay here. You're not going</br>   to be able to do anything over there, it's so hard. Minimum wage—the pay is</br>   horrible, the jobs are horrible.” And they're feeding you what they know</br>   and what they lived because they don't know any better, they don't know</br>   anything else.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And for a person who doesn't know a country, then they're going to</br>   take heed to that. If I watch a movie and I tell my friend, “Hey man, don't</br>   watch that movie, that movie is horrible.” Yeah, I watched it, you didn't</br>   and now you're going to take my opinion and apply it to your own beliefs.</br>   Okay, well, I mean, he's my friend he wouldn't lie to me, why would he lie</br>   to me? You're my mom, you're my brother, my sister, whatever. If you say</br>   it's bad, it's bad.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, do you think a lot of deportees, when they return, turn to</br>   crime?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: When they return to what, I'm sorry?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: To Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="a8379eed-4717-49c9-88de-0b74397b0ac9" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Family Separation">Rodolfo: I think a lot of the deportees, when they come back, yes. But I<br>
   think more about their family—the inability to help your family member, the<br>
   person who you love is one of the most horrible... it's a horrible feeling,<br>
   not being able to help, let alone help one of your family members.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I remember my mom crying over the phone and telling me, “Man, I<br>
   just want to help you. I wish I could just go and get you.“ Or, “Man, I'm<br>
   going to ask around and see if I can find a lawyer and everything.” Oh my<br>
   god, don't let me get started on the lawyers over there. They're not quite<br>
   good people, right? Because they take advantage of that as well. But that's<br>
   another conversation.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, on that piece about helping families. What do you think the US<br>
   government can do to help Mexican deportees and the families that they<br>
   leave behind? You left your family.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: If it'd be up to me, everybody would be together and there would<br>
   be no borders and no laws. But what the US government can do to help<br>
   families in that position is if one of your family members is in a<br>
   detention center, you automatically— there should be a law, there should be<br>
   a rule, whatever man—can go and visit. You can go visit and get visited by<br>
   anybody who they want and they can't touch them. It doesn't matter if it's<br>
   a federal, state law or whatever.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: You can't deprive somebody of their family like that, man. I<br>
   understand you're not from here, and okay, they're in deportation<br>
   proceedings and everything, but that's why there's so many fights in there,<br>
   you know? That's where there's so much aggression, so much tension, because<br>
   you don't know what's going to happen.<br>

   how they've gone about being in Mexico has to do greatly with their support<br>
   system in Mexico. And unfortunately, I had the shorter end of the stick. I<br>
   felt like I needed to pass by the things I needed to pass in order for me<br>
   to get to the point where I am right now in this very point in time, in<br>
   this chair, wearing these clothes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It wasn't the most prettiest thing. I was homeless for a while. I<br>
   didn't have a house. My house was a 2016 Nissan Versa and that's only<br>
   because I took a job as an Uber driver and it wasn't even my car, it was<br>
   somebody else's. But I couldn't tell that guy it wasn't my car because he<br>
   probably wouldn't even have let me keep driving. So, my first, my initial<br>
   experience in Mexico was bad, it was bad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I was lied to, I was deceived, I was stolen from. It's like every<br>
   little turn it was always a smack in the head or something. But little by<br>
   little I started getting acclimated to everything that was going on. How I<br>
   should go about moving in certain areas or how I should talk, how I should<br>
   move. Better yet, how to adapt to certain situations.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="a7cfaaf4-4e5b-4c64-b895-a99c80ddd66d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Identity, American, Mexican, Bi-cultural">Rodolfo: I don't want to say I feel like American. Spiritually, me myself,<br>
   as an individual, I feel like now that I've been in Mexico and been living<br>
   the real life of a real life Mexican—because man, it's hard out here, you<br>
   know?—I feel like if I say I'm American, I feel like I'm betraying who I<br>
   am. Because I have American… Yes, I'm from... Because even then I can't<br>
   even say I'm American cause I'm not from there, that's why I'm here, right?<br>
   But the way I feel, yeah, I guess I am what they call me here, el gabacho,<br>
   the American, the white boy. Do I feel it? I feel it only because I miss my<br>
   home and that's what I want to be in order to be okay over there. I mean,<br>
   if that's what I have to be in order to be okay over there and then, okay,<br>
   yeah, I'm American.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: But when I'm amongst individuals, Mexicans here and everything, my<br>
   own people, I'm a Mexican. It still takes me a little while for me to be<br>
   able to really integrate myself because to this point, to this day, I still<br>
   have trouble expressing myself 100% in Spanish. I always try to better my<br>
   Spanish, but it gets to the point where sometimes I can't fully express the<br>
   way I feel at times.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: So, I speak in English but then you can't understand me in English<br>
   because you speak all Spanish. So, those are the times when I really truly<br>
   do feel American more than I feel Mexican. Because if I can't voice and<br>
   express my true feelings in my native tongue then that's—my native tongue<br>
   is English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: So, you know what? Now that you do mention it, yeah, I feel more<br>
   American now than I do Mexican and it's kind of mixed feelings. Because I'm<br>
   trying to forget everything that I was over, that was going on over there,<br>
   that I lived over there. But it's hard because I want to go back, I want to<br>
   be able to punch in at Cheesecake Factory, and I want to be able to come<br>
   home and just be with my family. But yeah, I do feel more American than I<br>
   do Mexican and I'm not ashamed to say that's who I am. Short of being born<br>
   over there, I'm from over there.<br>

   Wisconsin—I'm sorry, they took me to Rock Island, Illinois—for processing.<br>
   That was the processing center.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: They took my fingerprint and my name, first and last name and<br>
   everything. Right? So I wasn't… I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. They<br>
   took my name and everything, right? But then they had a form in front of me<br>
   and they told me here, sign here and you know you'll be all set. And I<br>
   asked them, “Well here, give me a second, let me read it.” And there was<br>
   another person, right? Because it was a desk like this one. It was four<br>
   seats this way with the divider being the computer, the fingerprint scanner<br>
   and a camera, like a little Nikon camera, simple camera. And I told<br>
   everybody— I was the only one who spoke English or perfect English at<br>
   that—&quot;Hey man, don't sign anything at all until you know what you're<br>
   signing because you don't know what you're signing. For all you know you're<br>
   signing your liver away. So, just don't sign anything.” And the guy told<br>
   me, “Hey man, shut your mouth. We're talking to you; we're not talking to<br>
   them. I'm talking to you. Don't be a hero or don't be a jailhouse lawyer.”<br>
   I'm like, “A jailhouse lawyer? I'm not in jail.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And they told me, “Just sign here.” I'm like, “No, I'm not going<br>
   to sign it.” And I started reading through it, and it basically everything<br>
   that it said was, “I waive my right to an appeal. I waive my right to any<br>
   formal hearing. Basically, deport me as soon as possible.” And I'm like,<br>
   “So you're telling me that without explaining to me what's going on or what<br>
   this form entails, you're just going to have me sign it?”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Because they told me, “We're not going to let you speak to your<br>
   family and you're not going to see your family for a long time if you don't<br>
   sign this because you're breaking some law or whatever.” Because they even<br>
   showed me little papers saying, if you state that you're a US citizen it's<br>
   a federal crime punishable by between—I think it was like—three to seven<br>
   years in federal prison.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Now, I'm not sure if that was another one of their little tactics<br>
   or whatever, but nonetheless didn't let it scare me, I didn't let it affect<br>
   me. I'm like, “Okay cool, that's great man, I'm not going to sign this. I<br>
   need to go in front of a proper hearing and a judge. I want to bond set.<br>
   Because I know, well, I may not know my rights a hundred percent, but I<br>
   know that I'm, I'm entitled to a bond or at least a hearing for a bond.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And they told me, “Wait right here.” And then they went to go get<br>
   a supervisor, and the supervisor spoke to me in private and he gave me<br>
   another form and he was like, “Okay, you want a proper hearing? Sign here.”<br>
   And I read it and, okay here, then like, man, this is what it is? It took<br>
   me getting loud with you. I was a bit belligerent, I'm not going to lie to<br>
   you tell you I was the best, as they called me, “detainee.” But I'm going<br>
   to fight for my home. I understand I was born in Mexico, but Chicago's my<br>
   home, it's my land, that's where I'm from. And whatever I can do to stay<br>
   there, I'd be okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And so, yeah, that's what it was. But it took me probably a good,<br>
   five months before I could see a judge.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You were in detention that whole time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I was in detention. I was in a detention center for five months.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Before seeing the judge?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Before seeing the judge. And it wasn't even a formal hearing I<br>
   did. It was over the internet and the monitors, surprisingly that day, did<br>
   not work. So, all I heard was voices and I told them “No, I want a proper<br>
   hearing. I can't see the judge. For all I know there's a guy in the next<br>
   room talking to me and there's no judge.” “Okay, well you're going to have<br>
   to wait on a whole another six months.” And I'm not going to lie to you,<br>
   those detention centers aren't all that pretty, you know what I mean?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I just didn't want to be locked up anymore. That, honestly, that<br>
   scared me. I didn't want to do another whole six months. By that point, I<br>
   would've done a year just to go see one judge for a bond. Finally, I said,<br>
   “Yeah, you know what? Yeah, I want one. I'll take the six months, give me<br>
   the six months. Just so I can see a judge.” Surprisingly, there was another<br>
   court hearing, I think, a month from then. So, I finally got to see the<br>
   judge, but they set the bond at $50,000. And I don't have a $50,000, my<br>
   family doesn't have $50,000. So, I sat there. I sat the two and a half<br>
   years because I wanted to fight it. Every possible angle that I could<br>
   probably touch, I tried it.<br>
 <br>

   the immigration, it was something I had never experienced in my life. I<br>
   mean, I was never deprived of my freedom. And it wasn't because I committed<br>
   an actual crime. I didn't go and take somebody's laptop, or I didn't go<br>
   into a store with a loaded gun and ask for money. No, it was one of the<br>
   most horrible experiences I've ever been through. It was more their idea of<br>

   truck, they didn't even have the DHS seal on it. I didn't understand it,<br>
   because I even told them all, &quot;Isn't this a sanctuary city? Can you guys do<br>

   he was 15 he accumulated a lot of driving tickets. He is dangerous to the<br>
   road.&quot; I'm like, &quot;What? [Incredulous]. All my tickets are because you guys<br>
   pull me over. It was late at night, I was the only car on the road. I mean,<br>
   obviously, if a police officer tails you for more than two miles, you're<br>
   gonna do something wrong in their eyes, right?” That's just what happened.<br>
   I kept on driving, why? Because I went to school and I went to work, and<br>
   it's just easier, it's just more convenient to drive your car that you paid<br>
   for, than to go through the hassle of the CTA—the CTA is the Chicago<br>
   Transit Authority.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah, that's the way it was, but I always saw it as, “Man, don't<br>
   let that affect you.” But, hey man, it affected me all right? If I didn't<br>
   drive, I would probably still be over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What did they give you tickets for?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Driving with no valid drivers license. Then after two or three<br>
   time it turns into an aggravated... No, sorry, it turns into a felony. It's<br>
   just the same kind, but now it's a felony instead of a misdemeanor.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: They just pulled you over because they saw that... Why did they pull<br>
   you over?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: One of the first times was because I had a busted taillight. I<br>
   didn't realize that the lightbulb had gone out. Then after that...Once<br>
   again, I didn't live in the best place around town, so police would always<br>
   be around. I guess they just saw me and they would always just get behind<br>
   me. It wasn't just me, it was other friends. Even when I would be with<br>
   other coworkers, it would happen the same way. In Rogers Park, by Evanston,<br>
   and even in Wrigleyville, a whole bunch of places, if it's late at night<br>
   and they just see one or two individuals, especially Hispanic or<br>
   African-American, they're gonna see what's going on.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: They're gonna want to see what's going on. That's what happened,<br>
   because I literally would ask them, &quot;Why did you pull me over?&quot; &quot;Improper<br>
   lane usage.&quot; All my tickets improper lane usage, failed to use turn signal.<br>
   It was really aggravating because it was like, “Man bro, you see me with my<br>
   work uniform on, you see the food right next to me. Literally, here is my<br>
   work ID, this is where I work, and I'm coming from work. Please just let me<br>
   go home.&quot; &quot;Please step out of the car.&quot; Impound the car, or, I'm not gonna<br>
   lie, some of the times that I did get pulled over sometimes they just let<br>
   me leave the car, or they had me call somebody with a license, but that was<br>
   very, very rare that would happen.<br>
 <br>

   all got their license, they all were able to get their ID and everything.<br>
   And I wasn't able to do it. Then when I was asked, &quot;Hey man, why don't you<br>
   get your license?&quot; Only some of my very, very close friends—probably like<br>
   two friends—knew that I wasn't documented. Then, when we spoke about it<br>
   amongst other friends, they knew that it was like another secret you had to<br>
   keep. Yeah, it was different with other kid. Sometimes I'll be even<br>
   jealous, because I'm like, &quot;Damn, if only I had been born a couple of miles<br>
   North of the border, or West of the border, or whatever, I could be in your<br>
   position.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I'm like, &quot;Why, why do I have to feel that way man? I'm a good<br>
   person. I've made mistakes and things like that but hey man...” Nah, don't<br>
   think that way you know? Just because you don't have a visa that says<br>
   you're from America, doesn’t mean you can't do the same things. What, at 15<br>
   I bought my first car by myself. At 16, I got my first ticket, my first<br>
   pull over. But why? Because I was coming home from work. That's when I was<br>
   already working at Chili's—I was working in Schofield, Illinois at Chili's.<br>
   You know restaurant jobs, you got to work late. At that time in the<br>
   suburbs, there's not much transportation short of a cab ride. But I'm not<br>
   gonna be wasting money every day, so that's why I bought my car.<br>

   really gonna affect you, until you're in the back of the DHS, the<br>
   Department of Homeland Security, van. You're next to a whole bunch of<br>
   people you never met, and they're also in the same position. Some don't<br>
   even speak English. You don't really understand how immediately it can<br>
   affect you until it affects you. I never thought it would affect me. Okay,<br>
   well I mean, I'm working, I'm going to school—I'm in high school—I'm doing<br>
   this, this and that. Some of my friends who are students already dropped<br>
   out. Did everything, they’ve already gone to prison and back and<br>
   everything, and they haven't even hit their 21st birthday.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: And I'm still good, I'm still good. I may not be a straight A<br>
   student or anything, but hey man, I'm still here! Why can't I have the same<br>
   privilege as you all do? Why can't I get my license? You know how happy I<br>
   was when I got my license here, damn. I love to drive, that's one of my<br>
   passions. Always, always, always I love to drive. I couldn't get my license<br>
   over there. I remember even in high school in drivers ed, I knew what the<br>
   answer was, but I asked my mom, “Hey mom, can I apply for drivers ed, so I<br>
   can get my license? “She was like, &quot;You know you can't get your license.&quot;<br>
   Again, one of the primary things, I’m like damn, I'm just not gonna be able<br>
   to drive all my life? Or if I do drive and I get pulled over—as a matter of<br>
   fact, that's the reason why I got deported, driving without a valid drivers<br>
   license.<br>

  </span><span id="c894ccb3-fd79-4406-8b7e-57b28d123f4b" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Dreams, Lawyer">Rodolfo: I wanted to be a lawyer, man, that's what I wanted to be. That's<br>
   what I wanted to be, a lawyer. It's funny, because when I was younger I<br>
   wanted to be a lawyer. Then after that I'm like, &quot;I want to be an<br>
   immigration lawyer, that's what I want to be now. I want to be an<br>
   immigration lawyer.” I was already on the right track to being a lawyer,<br>
   but then when that happened, it really opened my eyes more to, &quot;Okay, let's<br>
   help my people.&quot;</span> I didn't realize... I know individuals over there who are</br>   citizens, and they're panhandling because they want to. They're on their</br>   own addiction or for whatever reason right? Or people who are just living</br>   off the government, but then I see some of my family members, or my</br>   friends’ family members and they're not citizens but they have businesses.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They have a business, they have trucks, they have houses, they're</br>   great. They're not living off the Government, they're not asking for a</br>   handout. They're living better than what a citizen is living. It's all</br>   about how much work you put in, right? If you hang around people who don't</br>   want to do anything, then you're not gonna do anything. I remember Gerald</br>   Ford always told me that. He was like, &quot;If you want to be a millionaire,</br>   hang around millionaires. If you want to be successful, hang around people</br>   who do successful things, but if you want to keep doing what you're doing,</br>   and just be a little caddie or whatever, stay here. Stay here and maybe one</br>   day you'll do something else.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: He was very blunt in that aspect like, &quot;Always do a good job. I</br>   don't care if you're a shit-shoveler, you're gonna be the best shit</br>   shoveler there is.” That always stuck to me, that's why whatever I do, it's</br>   always been 100%.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Can I speak? I'm Anita, I'm the director of this project.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm really pleased to meet you—</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Likewise.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm amazed at your incredible story. When you talked about the trip</br>   to DC, the debate club, and you got very sad—</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... what made you sad, and did it make you feeling... Do you</br>   remember what your feelings were as you sort of found that all these</br>   options were gone to you?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="c5313e14-a580-4fbb-842d-751804cec88d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Feelings, Sadness, Frustration, Frustration, Isolation, Immigration status, Lost opportunities, Broken system, Living undocumented">Rodolfo: Well, it was just mixed emotions. I felt sad because I contributed<br>
   to the team a lot. I wasn't just there, and it made me sad because I wasn't<br>
   going to be able be with my friends, my teammates. It also made me mad<br>
   because all my life, all my short period, my whole time here in Chicago or<br>
   whatever, I don't think I've done anything bad. Why shouldn't I have the<br>
   privilege to go if I put in the same work as they did? Only because I don't<br>
   have a social security number or a document that lets me buy a plane ticket<br>
   and go over there? I think about it in a different—at the same time, I was<br>
   a little kid too—I just cried a lot. That night I just cried a lot because<br>
   I knew I wasn't gonna go. My mom spoke to the, I'm not sure what my mom<br>
   told her, but see, I don't think she told her that we're undocumented, and<br>
   I can't fly.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: Yeah, I just remember that night feeling very sad, very sad, but<br>
   then it turned into anger. It was like, &quot;Man, why can't I?&quot; It was always<br>
   just that, &quot;Why can't I? I put in the same work, and just because I wasn't<br>
   born here, I can't fly?&quot; I even looked into bus routes and everything to DC<br>
   and stuff like that, but my mom was like, &quot;No, you're crazy, you can't go<br>
   alone.&quot; She worked and everything, I just felt sad, mostly sad.<br>

   happened. Yeah, it changed a lot. It changed the way I viewed everything<br>
   around me. Like, spring break all my friends would go certain places out of<br>
   the country, and I used to get invited and, &quot;No, I can't go man, my family<br>
   doesn't think...&quot; It would always have to be lie after lie after lie. I<br>
   didn't want to... for one, I always had that idea of like my mom and my<br>
   family always told me, &quot;Don't ever tell anybody you're an immigrant. If<br>
   somebody has that knowledge they can do you harm. They can take you away<br>
   from here, they can take us away from each other.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I'm seeing it now, with the families going across the border, and<br>
   them being separated. I didn't understand it at the time, and man, now I do<br>
   understand it. I didn't know how it really was until I finally got put in<br>
   handcuffs and got shipped to an immigration facility.<br>

I knew, at the end<br>
   of the day, I'm not eligible for scholarships. I don't get any aid, I don't<br>
   get anything. In my mind I thought, “Man, what's the point of really<br>
   working hard in school if at the end of the day, I'm not gonna get any<br>
   help?” My mom is having to work to put me through college. No, I don't want<br>
   this, so I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna give her what she<br>
   wants, my diploma, my high school diploma. From then on, if I want to do<br>
   something, it'll be by my own hand, out of my own pocket. I didn't want her<br>
   to... Not that I was a burden or anything, my objective was for her not to<br>
   work that much. That's it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: After she told me that, I'm like, &quot;Well, okay, what's the point of<br>
   really working hard and putting your best effort into school if, in my<br>
   position, I won't be able to surpass US citizens.&quot; Then the aspect of<br>

One of the first<br>
   jobs I had…My uncle worked at a restaurant called, Baker's Square in<br>
   Chicago. It was on the corner of Tui and Pratt. I really, really, really<br>
   wanted—I think I was in fifth or sixth grade—a phone. I wanted a phone,<br>
   it’s called the Psychic Slide. Phones used to flip, but this one slides. I<br>
   wasn't gonna ask my mom for it, so I asked my uncle. &quot;Hey man, I know you<br>
   work at Baker's Square and I know around the holiday season it gets really<br>
   busy. Can I help you? Can I go?&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, yeah, if you want.&quot; I<br>
   used to wake up like 3:00 in the morning, and I used to go and help him<br>
   out. After that, I really liked making money and I really liked dressing<br>
   nice, I liked having my nice haircut or whatever. My very, very first job<br>
   was in Wilmette, Illinois. I was a caddie. Yeah, and then—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: On the golf course?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: On the golf course, yeah. Wilmette Golf Course actually. I<br>
   remember I was always the first one there. They used to choose us, when<br>
   everybody got there, &quot;Okay, you come with me, you come with me.&quot; I used to<br>
   always go there and there was a gentleman by the name of... Man, I forgot<br>
   his name. Like the President, Gerald Ford, that was his name Gerald Ford!<br>
   The only reason I remembered was because of the President. He used to<br>
   always get there around the same time I got there. He finally asked me, &quot;Do<br>
   you want to be my personal caddie? I don't want you working anymore with<br>
   all these other kids, because nobody wants to work. Do you want to be my<br>
   personal caddie?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, absolutely.&quot; It was going really, really<br>
   well and everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I got to high school, I had a number of jobs. I worked at Subway,<br>
   I worked at Chili's, I worked at... What was it? Outback Steak House, but<br>
   then I finally just got to the Cheesecake Factory, and that's where I<br>
   stayed the remainder of my time. The remainder of my time I stayed there,<br>
   and I started from the busboy and I finally ended up being a bartender. One<br>
   of the head bartenders, one of the head servers, they used to pay-out<br>
   people and everything. Obviously, I didn't have my social or anything, but<br>
   I was a little bit older than what I really was. When I first got there,<br>
   when I first, first started working I think I was like 14. Obviously you<br>
   can't work that young, I think actually, I was 18, at 14.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I didn't see it as anything bad. I knew that if I got caught with<br>
   my fake ID and my fake social security card I'd get in trouble, but that's<br>
   why we're there, that's why we worked. I didn't get a fake ID to go party<br>
   or go get into clubs or bars or anything. The main purpose of it was for me<br>
   to be able to get a job, and so my mom wouldn't have to work all those<br>
   hours that she used to work. She used to work at a Burger King, overnight.<br>
   I used to barely see her, and I didn't want that anymore. I told her, &quot;You<br>
   don't have to work that much if I start working. We can help each other<br>
   out, we can, we're a team.”</span><span id="983a8579-c386-41f2-b64d-2af5c8e12fdf" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TYPO -- remove golf course name">Wilmette Golf Course</span><span id="4a43d282-0260-4d7e-9b24-897e8527383a" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Awareness of what was happening, Mexico, Before the US">Baker's Square in<br>

When I was younger,<br>
   when my mother and I arrived to Chicago, I remember my aunts telling her,<br>
   &quot;Don't go out that much. Stay indoors, because if they see you, they can<br>
   take you.&quot; I'm at a very young age, at that point, I think I was six or<br>
   seven. Adults are talking in the room and you hear them tell your mom,<br>
   &quot;Don't go out that much. If they see you out there, they're gonna grab<br>
   you.&quot; I thought like, “Whoa, who's gonna grab us, who's gonna grab mom?” I<br>
   didn't understand the concept of the legal side of migration. Why we're not<br>
   supposed to be here. I'd never quite fully understood why I wasn't supposed<br>
   to be there.<br>

 <br>
   Rodolfo: Until finally, one time my stepdad, he told me, &quot;You need to go to<br>
   school and do everything that you need to do, because we're not supposed to<br>
   be here.&quot; I asked him, &quot;Why not, why can't we be here?&quot; He told me, &quot;We're<br>
   immigrants, we come from a different country. You weren't born here, I<br>
   wasn't born here, and this isn't our country. People don't want us here<br>
   because they say we take their jobs. Or they have a preconceived image of<br>

   teacher, I'm not sure which one it was. She was awesome, she always help me<br>
   out with the English, always. Even in parent teacher conferences, she would<br>
   literally always talk to my mom as if she'd be really interested. She would<br>
   show genuine interest in what was going on with, not just me, but with the<br>
   Hispanic kids. Kids who had trouble with English or weren't doing the best<br>
   academically. She always would tell me, &quot;Don't worry, you're gonna get it.<br>
   You're gonna learn it.&quot; She had such a big heart.<br>

   gestures. She would always be like, 'Yeah, for this or for that.'&quot; Even<br>
   though I knew I wasn't the smartest or the most best behaved kid, she would<br>
   always have that initiative to get us there. Get us to that point. Yeah,<br>
   that was one of my favorite teachers. Man, I value that so much actually<br>
   now. I miss that teacher. Another teacher was in fifth grade, his name was<br>
   Mr. Stoom. He was Argentinian, he was from Argentina. He was another great<br>
   teacher. He always told us, &quot;Don't ever forget where you came from. Your<br>

   learn it. I always heard kids at the park or at the store, at Target, at<br>

   sure…it was like the little hand-held games. I'm not sure, I think it was<br>
   the Rug Rats or something like that. I remember getting that little toy and<br>
   thinking, wow, it's a kid's... It had little fries and a burger, and you<br>
   get a toy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: It was the first time I had ever saw that, and I got really happy,<br>
   because I was playing the little game and all that. I thought that was the<br>
   coolest thing in the world. After then, we went into a room... it couldn't<br>
   have been more... It was just a standard living room, but there was<br>
   probably like 50 or 60 people in there. Some of them were sitting and it<br>
   smelled horrible. It obviously wasn't the best place. I guess it was just<br>
   for people waiting for their relatives to go pick them up or something, I'm<br>
   not sure. It was just my mother and I and I remember there was a lady with<br>
   a big pot, and she was just cooking. I'm not sure what she was cooking but<br>
   we went into another room and all I remember hearing was a big slam.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I looked back and it was a cage. It was literally like they<br>
   fashioned a metal door with metal bars between the thresholds of the living<br>
   room from end to end so nobody could get out. Then the windows were the<br>
   same, they had burglar bars so nobody would get out. I was wondering, why<br>
   is this happening? At that time, obviously, you were a kid, you don't<br>
   understand what's going on. First I got fed, I have a little game, and now<br>
   I'm in this steel cage that smells horrible. I remember somebody arguing<br>
   with the other person that, &quot;The bucket was full. The bucket was full.&quot; I<br>
   was hearing that, &quot;You need to empty out this bucket.&quot; I realized that was<br>
   the bathroom, that's why it smelled so horrible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Rodolfo: I remember the guy just closing a curtain, and just telling me to,<br>
   &quot;Shut up.&quot; That's when I felt fear for the first time. Even though I was in<br>
   the desert and everything, that's the very, very first time I felt genuine<br>
   fear. I didn't know what was going on. I felt it because my mom felt it.<br>
   She was just hugging me, and that was like the last thing I remember. After<br>
   that I remember just waking up in the apartment complex. In a room, but it<br>
   was completely different, it was somebody else. I guess these people knew<br>
   my mother, because they spoke to her by name and everything. That was one<br>
   of the very first memories.<br>

  </span><span id="b5afe4ca-e9e3-42bd-bc79-5a15747cc8dc" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Migration from Mexico, Border crossing, General,  desert">I remember<br>
   everything that happened from start to finish. From the beginning where we<br>
   got picked up, to being in the desert. I still remember eating cereal with<br>
   water. It was... I don't know, it was very, very... I feel like it was...<br>
   it obviously had an impact psychologically, because I still just have a lot<br>
   of anxiety when I'm in certain places that I'm really accustomed to. A two,<br>
   three year old in the middle of the desert, it definitely had to have an<br>
   impact on me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Sergio: How old were you when that happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was two and a half years old, so that's why I'm saying it's very</br>   odd for me to be able to remember that at a very, very young age. It wasn't</br>   only that, just even when I was here, when I was two, two and a half, I</br>   used to remember asking my mom certain memories that I had. She would say,</br>   &quot;Oh you were one year old, one and a half years old, how did you remember</br>   that?&quot; It was always very, like a violent, violent memory that I had. It</br>   was more so like my father being drunk or high or whatever and coming in</br>   the house. Taking any little money my mom made for the week, in order for</br>   him to keep on doing what he was doing. Just coming in and just tearing up</br>   the place.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What's one of the first memories you have of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One of the very first memories I have of the US, was, I was in a</br>   truck with my mom—I'm not sure if this was before or after the fact, that</br>   we had already arrived because we arrived in Phoenix, Arizona—was somebody</br>   asking my mom, &quot;Have you and your son ate?&quot; I remember my mom telling him,</br>   &quot;No, but I have a sandwich here and some snacks for him.&quot; He went, &quot;No,</br>   here, you're in America now, you're in Phoenix now, let's go get a burger.&quot;</br>   I remember that somebody bought me—I don't know if it was her or him, the</br>   driver—a kid's meal from MacDonald's. This is when they had... I'm not</br>   sure…it was like the little hand-held games. I'm not sure, I think it was</br>   the Rug Rats or something like that. I remember getting that little toy and</br>   thinking, wow, it's a kid's...

I thought that was the</br>   coolest thing in the world. After then, we went into a room... it couldn't</br>   have been more... It was just a standard living room, but there was</br>   probably like 50 or 60 people in there. Some of them were sitting and it</br>   smelled horrible. It obviously wasn't the best place.

In a room, but it</br>   was completely different, it was somebody else. I guess these people knew</br>   my mother, because they spoke to her by name and everything. That was one</br>   of the very first memories.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What about school?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: School? One of the first memories I have from school, after</br>   Phoenix—I wasn't going to school in Phoenix, actually, I think I even</br>   skipped kindergarten—we moved to Long Beach, California. And the only thing</br>   I remember from school was my mom waking me up probably about four or five</br>   in the morning. The sun wasn't even out yet, and she would walk me to this</br>   random lady's house. Actually, she wasn't random, but she was just some</br>   lady I didn't know. There was two other kids there, and I would be in</br>   uniform. That was the first time I actually wore a uniform to go to school.</br>   I was there, but I didn't really remember that much. When we moved to</br>   Chicago, that's when everything changed.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was a little bit older. I remember I went to Jordan Elementary.</br>   It was in the North side of Chicago. We were there for a very brief moment,</br>   because then we moved to Evanston. Evanston was literally right next to</br>   Chicago. The school I was attending was called Orrington Elementary. The</br>   reason why we moved, once again, is because she wanted a better quality of</br>   life for me. Where I was at, it was all English, there was no Spanish.</br>   Obviously, there were Hispanic kids who already spoke English, but there</br>   wasn't... She, herself didn't know English, so how could she teach me, so</br>   how could I be integrated into a school that doesn't even accommodate for</br>   individuals or kids who don't know English?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: She moved schools, although we were still in Chicago because we</br>   needed... what was it? Proof of residency. We lived out of district, and</br>   she would get fined or I wouldn't be able to go to school there. The point</br>   is I went to school to Orrington Elementary. The program was called the TWI</br>   (Two Way Immersion). It was a bilingual program and that's where I learned</br>   my English, that school. Friends and everything. I feel as though like,</br>   that's why I learned my English so well, because I really, really wanted to</br>   learn it. I always heard kids at the park or at the store, at Target, at</br>   Jewels, or whatever and everybody spoke English, right? I just felt</br>   fascinated, I was intrigued by it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It was a whole different language that I didn't know, and I wanted</br>   to master it. I wanted to be able to talk as they spoke, or talk as they</br>   talked. School was a very cool experience. I always had a lot of friends,</br>   and I was always the life of the classroom. I wasn't probably the best</br>   behaved kid, but I was always integrated in to what was going on with the</br>   school.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you remember any teachers or people?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, absolutely. Ms. Mule, Ms. Mule was my second or third grade</br>   teacher, I'm not sure which one it was. She was awesome, she always help me</br>   out with the English, always. Even in parent teacher conferences, she would</br>   literally always talk to my mom as if she'd be really interested. She would</br>   show genuine interest in what was going on with, not just me, but with the</br>   Hispanic kids. Kids who had trouble with English or weren't doing the best</br>   academically. She always would tell me, &quot;Don't worry, you're gonna get it.</br>   You're gonna learn it.&quot; She had such a big heart.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Still even, my mother and I still talk about the teacher to this</br>   point in time. She tells me, &quot;I remember Ms. Mule and she used to use hand</br>   gestures. She would always be like, 'Yeah, for this or for that.'&quot; Even</br>   though I knew I wasn't the smartest or the most best behaved kid, she would</br>   always have that initiative to get us there. Get us to that point. Yeah,</br>   that was one of my favorite teachers. Man, I value that so much actually</br>   now. I miss that teacher. Another teacher was in fifth grade, his name was</br>   Mr. Stoom. He was Argentinian, he was from Argentina. He was another great</br>   teacher. He always told us, &quot;Don't ever forget where you came from. Your</br>   roots are who you are, even though you all are coming from different parts</br>   of the world, don't ever forget who you are and where you come from.&quot;</br>   That's one of the biggest things right now, I'm kind of ashamed of.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm not, because I was so... What do they say, &quot;Americanized.&quot; In</br>   Chicago, I was so in America. I never dedicated the time to open a book or</br>   even Google something of my home country. Now that I get here, I don't know</br>   what is going on. Just barely a couple of months ago, I found out Mexico is</br>   a third-world country. I didn't know that. I go to Polanco Fendi, Prado,</br>   Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton boutiques. To me, that's not a third world</br>   country. Yeah, that teacher was the one who started opening my eyes up more</br>   to my surroundings.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Have you always known that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Have I always known that I was undocumented? When I was younger,</br>   when my mother and I arrived to Chicago, I remember my aunts telling her,</br>   &quot;Don't go out that much. Stay indoors, because if they see you, they can</br>   take you.&quot; I'm at a very young age, at that point, I think I was six or</br>   seven. Adults are talking in the room and you hear them tell your mom,</br>   &quot;Don't go out that much. If they see you out there, they're gonna grab</br>   you.&quot; I thought like, “Whoa, who's gonna grab us, who's gonna grab mom?” I</br>   didn't understand the concept of the legal side of migration. Why we're not</br>   supposed to be here. I'd never quite fully understood why I wasn't supposed</br>   to be there.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Until finally, one time my stepdad, he told me, &quot;You need to go to</br>   school and do everything that you need to do, because we're not supposed to</br>   be here.&quot; I asked him, &quot;Why not, why can't we be here?&quot; He told me, &quot;We're</br>   immigrants, we come from a different country. You weren't born here, I</br>   wasn't born here, and this isn't our country. People don't want us here</br>   because they say we take their jobs. Or they have a preconceived image of</br>   what an immigrant is.&quot; I still didn't understand it yet, I didn't know why.</br>   You go to work, you pay your taxes, you do everything as my American</br>   parent's friends do.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Everybody... I go to their house and, yeah, they have big ‘ol</br>   houses and mansions and stuff like that, but at the end of the day, they go</br>   to work, they have a job. I don't see you out here stealing or doing</br>   anything, you're not causing any harm. Why can't we be here? He told us,</br>   &quot;Well, I mean, that's just the way things are.&quot; I didn't understand that</br>   until obviously I grew up and then I found that out. When I finally really,</br>   really understood what an immigrant was or why I was an immigrant, it was</br>   the day that—I was in a debate team in my middle school. We won, in the</br>   whole district we won. We won the top prize. We went... Not national, I</br>   think it was... Yeah, nationwide, we were supposed to go to DC.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: We were supposed to go to DC. I remember this then and it broke my</br>   heart, so I want to even cry now [Emotional]. Damn. I asked my mom, &quot;Can I</br>   go?&quot; She's like, &quot;No you can't.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because you can't fly.&quot;</br>   I'm like, &quot;Why can't I fly?&quot; She said, &quot;Because you don't have a state ID,</br>   you're not from here.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Damn.&quot; Then, I think she told the</br>   school... She made something up, but that's when I finally knew it. Like,</br>   &quot;Damn, this shit is real, this is real.&quot; Then after that I just, &quot;Okay,</br>   whatever, I'm just gonna see where this takes us.&quot; Yeah, that's around the</br>   time I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you ever work in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I worked all the time, I never stopped. One of the first</br>   jobs I had…My uncle worked at a restaurant called, Baker's Square in</br>   Chicago. It was on the corner of Tui and Pratt. I really, really, really</br>   wanted—I think I was in fifth or sixth grade—a phone. I wanted a phone,</br>   it’s called the Psychic Slide. Phones used to flip, but this one slides. I</br>   wasn't gonna ask my mom for it, so I asked my uncle. &quot;Hey man, I know you</br>   work at Baker's Square and I know around the holiday season it gets really</br>   busy. Can I help you? Can I go?&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, yeah, if you want.&quot; I</br>   used to wake up like 3:00 in the morning, and I used to go and help him</br>   out. After that, I really liked making money and I really liked dressing</br>   nice, I liked having my nice haircut or whatever. My very, very first job</br>   was in Wilmette, Illinois. I was a caddie. Yeah, and then—</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: On the golf course?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: On the golf course, yeah. Wilmette Golf Course actually. I</br>   remember I was always the first one there. They used to choose us, when</br>   everybody got there, &quot;Okay, you come with me, you come with me.&quot; I used to</br>   always go there and there was a gentleman by the name of... Man, I forgot</br>   his name. Like the President, Gerald Ford, that was his name Gerald Ford!</br>   The only reason I remembered was because of the President. He used to</br>   always get there around the same time I got there. He finally asked me, &quot;Do</br>   you want to be my personal caddie? I don't want you working anymore with</br>   all these other kids, because nobody wants to work. Do you want to be my</br>   personal caddie?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, absolutely.&quot; It was going really, really</br>   well and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I got to high school, I had a number of jobs. I worked at Subway,</br>   I worked at Chili's, I worked at... What was it? Outback Steak House, but</br>   then I finally just got to the Cheesecake Factory, and that's where I</br>   stayed the remainder of my time. The remainder of my time I stayed there,</br>   and I started from the busboy and I finally ended up being a bartender. One</br>   of the head bartenders, one of the head servers, they used to pay-out</br>   people and everything. Obviously, I didn't have my social or anything, but</br>   I was a little bit older than what I really was. When I first got there,</br>   when I first, first started working I think I was like 14. Obviously you</br>   can't work that young, I think actually, I was 18, at 14.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I didn't see it as anything bad. I knew that if I got caught with</br>   my fake ID and my fake social security card I'd get in trouble, but that's</br>   why we're there, that's why we worked. I didn't get a fake ID to go party</br>   or go get into clubs or bars or anything. The main purpose of it was for me</br>   to be able to get a job, and so my mom wouldn't have to work all those</br>   hours that she used to work. She used to work at a Burger King, overnight.</br>   I used to barely see her, and I didn't want that anymore. I told her, &quot;You</br>   don't have to work that much if I start working. We can help each other</br>   out, we can, we're a team.” It was only my mother and I until I turned 14,</br>   when she met my stepdad. All throughout that, it was just my mother and I.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: After your mom told you couldn't go on that trip, how did that</br>   affect the way you were involved in school, the things you wanted to do,</br>   did that change? Is there anything that you...?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I didn't put as much effort as I did anymore. I knew, at the end</br>   of the day, I'm not eligible for scholarships. I don't get any aid, I don't</br>   get anything. In my mind I thought, “Man, what's the point of really</br>   working hard in school if at the end of the day, I'm not gonna get any</br>   help?” My mom is having to work to put me through college. No, I don't want</br>   this, so I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna give her what she</br>   wants, my diploma, my high school diploma. From then on, if I want to do</br>   something, it'll be by my own hand, out of my own pocket. I didn't want her</br>   to... Not that I was a burden or anything, my objective was for her not to</br>   work that much. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: After she told me that, I'm like, &quot;Well, okay, what's the point of</br>   really working hard and putting your best effort into school if, in my</br>   position, I won't be able to surpass US citizens.&quot; Then the aspect of</br>   financial aid, or any aid at all, I'm not gonna have any of that. I tried</br>   it with the fake social, but obviously it didn't go through. Nothing</br>   happened. Yeah, it changed a lot. It changed the way I viewed everything</br>   around me. Like, spring break all my friends would go certain places out of</br>   the country, and I used to get invited and, &quot;No, I can't go man, my family</br>   doesn't think...&quot; It would always have to be lie after lie after lie. I</br>   didn't want to... for one, I always had that idea of like my mom and my</br>   family always told me, &quot;Don't ever tell anybody you're an immigrant. If</br>   somebody has that knowledge they can do you harm. They can take you away</br>   from here, they can take us away from each other.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm seeing it now, with the families going across the border, and</br>   them being separated. I didn't understand it at the time, and man, now I do</br>   understand it. I didn't know how it really was until I finally got put in</br>   handcuffs and got shipped to an immigration facility.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What do you think you would have wanted or end up being before you</br>   found out? What kind of things... Like you were on debate team that was—</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I wanted to be a lawyer, man, that's what I wanted to be. That's</br>   what I wanted to be, a lawyer. It's funny, because when I was younger I</br>   wanted to be a lawyer. Then after that I'm like, &quot;I want to be an</br>   immigration lawyer, that's what I want to be now. I want to be an</br>   immigration lawyer.” I was already on the right track to being a lawyer,</br>   but then when that happened, it really opened my eyes more to, &quot;Okay, let's</br>   help my people.&quot; I didn't realize... I know individuals over there who are</br>   citizens, and they're panhandling because they want to. They're on their</br>   own addiction or for whatever reason right? Or people who are just living</br>   off the government, but then I see some of my family members, or my</br>   friends’ family members and they're not citizens but they have businesses.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They have a business, they have trucks, they have houses, they're</br>   great. They're not living off the Government, they're not asking for a</br>   handout. They're living better than what a citizen is living. It's all</br>   about how much work you put in, right? If you hang around people who don't</br>   want to do anything, then you're not gonna do anything. I remember Gerald</br>   Ford always told me that. He was like, &quot;If you want to be a millionaire,</br>   hang around millionaires. If you want to be successful, hang around people</br>   who do successful things, but if you want to keep doing what you're doing,</br>   and just be a little caddie or whatever, stay here. Stay here and maybe one</br>   day you'll do something else.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: He was very blunt in that aspect like, &quot;Always do a good job. I</br>   don't care if you're a shit-shoveler, you're gonna be the best shit</br>   shoveler there is.” That always stuck to me, that's why whatever I do, it's</br>   always been 100%.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Can I speak? I'm Anita, I'm the director of this project.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm really pleased to meet you—</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Likewise.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm amazed at your incredible story. When you talked about the trip</br>   to DC, the debate club, and you got very sad—</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... what made you sad, and did it make you feeling... Do you</br>   remember what your feelings were as you sort of found that all these</br>   options were gone to you?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Well, it was just mixed emotions. I felt sad because I contributed</br>   to the team a lot. I wasn't just there, and it made me sad because I wasn't</br>   going to be able be with my friends, my teammates. It also made me mad</br>   because all my life, all my short period, my whole time here in Chicago or</br>   whatever, I don't think I've done anything bad. Why shouldn't I have the</br>   privilege to go if I put in the same work as they did? Only because I don't</br>   have a social security number or a document that lets me buy a plane ticket</br>   and go over there? I think about it in a different—at the same time, I was</br>   a little kid too—I just cried a lot. That night I just cried a lot because</br>   I knew I wasn't gonna go. My mom spoke to the, I'm not sure what my mom</br>   told her, but see, I don't think she told her that we're undocumented, and</br>   I can't fly.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I just remember that night feeling very sad, very sad, but</br>   then it turned into anger. It was like, &quot;Man, why can't I?&quot; It was always</br>   just that, &quot;Why can't I? I put in the same work, and just because I wasn't</br>   born here, I can't fly?&quot; I even looked into bus routes and everything to DC</br>   and stuff like that, but my mom was like, &quot;No, you're crazy, you can't go</br>   alone.&quot; She worked and everything, I just felt sad, mostly sad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did Gerald Ford know you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: No, Gerald Ford didn't know I was undocumented, no. I was still</br>   very young at that point. My mother and my family always told me, &quot;Don't</br>   let anybody know you're undocumented.” If somebody finds out, for whatever</br>   reason, there's some people who just are plain out racist or don't want</br>   people like me in the States. Sometimes they just do things to... I don't</br>   know. That's what I understood and that's what I took in and that's what I</br>   applied to my life. It's like living a secret, it was like living a second</br>   life or whatever. It’s like, &quot;Oh shit, why do I have to lie, why?&quot; I guess</br>   it's neither here nor there now, right? I'm here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That must have been incredibly difficult. I know personally, because</br>   I've had to keep secrets.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, I guess it's one of those things where you think it's never</br>   really gonna affect you, until you're in the back of the DHS, the</br>   Department of Homeland Security, van. You're next to a whole bunch of</br>   people you never met, and they're also in the same position. Some don't</br>   even speak English. You don't really understand how immediately it can</br>   affect you until it affects you. I never thought it would affect me. Okay,</br>   well I mean, I'm working, I'm going to school—I'm in high school—I'm doing</br>   this, this and that. Some of my friends who are students already dropped</br>   out. Did everything, they’ve already gone to prison and back and</br>   everything, and they haven't even hit their 21st birthday.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I'm still good, I'm still good. I may not be a straight A</br>   student or anything, but hey man, I'm still here! Why can't I have the same</br>   privilege as you all do? Why can't I get my license? You know how happy I</br>   was when I got my license here, damn. I love to drive, that's one of my</br>   passions. Always, always, always I love to drive. I couldn't get my license</br>   over there. I remember even in high school in drivers ed, I knew what the</br>   answer was, but I asked my mom, “Hey mom, can I apply for drivers ed, so I</br>   can get my license? “She was like, &quot;You know you can't get your license.&quot;</br>   Again, one of the primary things, I’m like damn, I'm just not gonna be able</br>   to drive all my life? Or if I do drive and I get pulled over—as a matter of</br>   fact, that's the reason why I got deported, driving without a valid drivers</br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I never got why the paper said, &quot;Driving on a suspended license.&quot;</br>   I would always ask them, &quot;If I don't have a license, why is it suspended?&quot;</br>   They just told me, &quot;Because you have a drivers license number, but you</br>   don't have a drivers license? I'm like, &quot;Okay, so if I have a drivers</br>   license number, why can't I get my drivers license?&quot; &quot;You don't have the</br>   proper documentation.&quot; I'm like, &quot;But I have my...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One day I thought, “Well why don't I just grab the driver license</br>   number and have somebody make me a fake drivers license, and put the</br>   drivers license on there?” But see, if I get caught with it, now I'm in</br>   more trouble, and now I'm seen as a real criminal, because now I'm going</br>   around the system once again. That's why we don't want you here, because</br>   you're gonna do things like that. [Exhale] I haven't talked about this in a</br>   while. It just makes me want to…I don’t know.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You know that was different from a lot of other people in high</br>   school probably too.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, it was a big difference for my friends and I, because they</br>   all got their license, they all were able to get their ID and everything.</br>   And I wasn't able to do it. Then when I was asked, &quot;Hey man, why don't you</br>   get your license?&quot; Only some of my very, very close friends—probably like</br>   two friends—knew that I wasn't documented. Then, when we spoke about it</br>   amongst other friends, they knew that it was like another secret you had to</br>   keep. Yeah, it was different with other kid. Sometimes I'll be even</br>   jealous, because I'm like, &quot;Damn, if only I had been born a couple of miles</br>   North of the border, or West of the border, or whatever, I could be in your</br>   position.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm like, &quot;Why, why do I have to feel that way man? I'm a good</br>   person. I've made mistakes and things like that but hey man...” Nah, don't</br>   think that way you know? Just because you don't have a visa that says</br>   you're from America, doesn’t mean you can't do the same things. What, at 15</br>   I bought my first car by myself. At 16, I got my first ticket, my first</br>   pull over. But why? Because I was coming home from work. That's when I was</br>   already working at Chili's—I was working in Schofield, Illinois at Chili's.</br>   You know restaurant jobs, you got to work late. At that time in the</br>   suburbs, there's not much transportation short of a cab ride. But I'm not</br>   gonna be wasting money every day, so that's why I bought my car.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: That's what happened, that's really why they got me. I remember</br>   when I was in Court they said, &quot;He has accumulated since he was 15. Since</br>   he was 15 he accumulated a lot of driving tickets. He is dangerous to the</br>   road.&quot; I'm like, &quot;What? [Incredulous]. All my tickets are because you guys</br>   pull me over. It was late at night, I was the only car on the road. I mean,</br>   obviously, if a police officer tails you for more than two miles, you're</br>   gonna do something wrong in their eyes, right?” That's just what happened.</br>   I kept on driving, why? Because I went to school and I went to work, and</br>   it's just easier, it's just more convenient to drive your car that you paid</br>   for, than to go through the hassle of the CTA—the CTA is the Chicago</br>   Transit Authority.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah, that's the way it was, but I always saw it as, “Man, don't</br>   let that affect you.” But, hey man, it affected me all right? If I didn't</br>   drive, I would probably still be over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did they give you tickets for?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Driving with no valid drivers license. Then after two or three</br>   time it turns into an aggravated... No, sorry, it turns into a felony. It's</br>   just the same kind, but now it's a felony instead of a misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They just pulled you over because they saw that... Why did they pull</br>   you over?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: One of the first times was because I had a busted taillight. I</br>   didn't realize that the lightbulb had gone out. Then after that...Once</br>   again, I didn't live in the best place around town, so police would always</br>   be around. I guess they just saw me and they would always just get behind</br>   me. It wasn't just me, it was other friends. Even when I would be with</br>   other coworkers, it would happen the same way. In Rogers Park, by Evanston,</br>   and even in Wrigleyville, a whole bunch of places, if it's late at night</br>   and they just see one or two individuals, especially Hispanic or</br>   African-American, they're gonna see what's going on.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They're gonna want to see what's going on. That's what happened,</br>   because I literally would ask them, &quot;Why did you pull me over?&quot; &quot;Improper</br>   lane usage.&quot; All my tickets improper lane usage, failed to use turn signal.</br>   It was really aggravating because it was like, “Man bro, you see me with my</br>   work uniform on, you see the food right next to me. Literally, here is my</br>   work ID, this is where I work, and I'm coming from work. Please just let me</br>   go home.&quot; &quot;Please step out of the car.&quot; Impound the car, or, I'm not gonna</br>   lie, some of the times that I did get pulled over sometimes they just let</br>   me leave the car, or they had me call somebody with a license, but that was</br>   very, very rare that would happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of those occasions immigration never picked, and never gave them to</br>   them... Chicago's a sanctuary city.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: No, Chicago's a sanctuary city, yeah. That's why I don't</br>   understand why I was picked up. The day I got picked up, I was driving to</br>   work. I parked my car and out of nowhere a Ford truck, it was unmarked</br>   truck, they didn't even have the DHS seal on it. I didn't understand it,</br>   because I even told them all, &quot;Isn't this a sanctuary city? Can you guys do</br>   this, is this against my Constitutional rights? I'm not that sure, not that</br>   well-educated in that aspect of it, but here, give me a book, I'll read it</br>   and I'll tell you what it is. I'm not stupid bro.&quot; That's why they</br>   separated me from the other people I was with, because it wasn't only</br>   Mexicans that I was with. I was with somebody from... I was with two</br>   Somalians.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They were brothers actually, two Somalians. I told everybody,</br>   &quot;Man, don't sign anything, don't talk, don't say anything. Just tell them</br>   you want a lawyer and that's it.” I remember they told me, &quot;Shut up,&quot; and</br>   they put me in a different cell, because I kept on telling everybody not to</br>   sign anything. Yeah, that's what I didn't understand—I didn't understand</br>   how they were able to go get me, but as I understood then and now,</br>   obviously federal laws are always gonna trump state laws. That's in the</br>   door, that's why you still see the dispensary in Colorado get raided,</br>   because it's a federal offense, and not state offense. I was literally a</br>   federal walking broken law.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's sad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: That's the way I saw it. Even though I'm cool, I'm all right and</br>   in Chicago, a sanctuary, but that's only state. They can come and just tear</br>   the place up into whatever they want because they're the government. And we</br>   can't do anything about it because I'm not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm gonna have to go in another room, can we pause for a second?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, after you were detained, how was your experience? What</br>   happened?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: After I was detained, I've got to say my experience going through</br>   the immigration, it was something I had never experienced in my life. I</br>   mean, I was never deprived of my freedom. And it wasn't because I committed</br>   an actual crime. I didn't go and take somebody's laptop, or I didn't go</br>   into a store with a loaded gun and ask for money. No, it was one of the</br>   most horrible experiences I've ever been through. It was more their idea of</br>   housing me because I'm not from there or it was...</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: [Pause]. I remember when I first got picked up, they took me to</br>   Wisconsin—I'm sorry, they took me to Rock Island, Illinois—for processing.</br>   That was the processing center.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: They took my fingerprint and my name, first and last name and</br>   everything. Right? So I wasn't… I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. They</br>   took my name and everything, right? But then they had a form in front of me</br>   and they told me here, sign here and you know you'll be all set. And I</br>   asked them, “Well here, give me a second, let me read it.” And there was</br>   another person, right? Because it was a desk like this one. It was four</br>   seats this way with the divider being the computer, the fingerprint scanner</br>   and a camera, like a little Nikon camera, simple camera. And I told</br>   everybody— I was the only one who spoke English or perfect English at</br>   that—&quot;Hey man, don't sign anything at all until you know what you're</br>   signing because you don't know what you're signing. For all you know you're</br>   signing your liver away. So, just don't sign anything.” And the guy told</br>   me, “Hey man, shut your mouth. We're talking to you; we're not talking to</br>   them. I'm talking to you. Don't be a hero or don't be a jailhouse lawyer.”</br>   I'm like, “A jailhouse lawyer? I'm not in jail.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And they told me, “Just sign here.” I'm like, “No, I'm not going</br>   to sign it.” And I started reading through it, and it basically everything</br>   that it said was, “I waive my right to an appeal. I waive my right to any</br>   formal hearing. Basically, deport me as soon as possible.” And I'm like,</br>   “So you're telling me that without explaining to me what's going on or what</br>   this form entails, you're just going to have me sign it?”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Because they told me, “We're not going to let you speak to your</br>   family and you're not going to see your family for a long time if you don't</br>   sign this because you're breaking some law or whatever.” Because they even</br>   showed me little papers saying, if you state that you're a US citizen it's</br>   a federal crime punishable by between—I think it was like—three to seven</br>   years in federal prison.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Now, I'm not sure if that was another one of their little tactics</br>   or whatever, but nonetheless didn't let it scare me, I didn't let it affect</br>   me. I'm like, “Okay cool, that's great man, I'm not going to sign this. I</br>   need to go in front of a proper hearing and a judge. I want to bond set.</br>   Because I know, well, I may not know my rights a hundred percent, but I</br>   know that I'm, I'm entitled to a bond or at least a hearing for a bond.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And they told me, “Wait right here.” And then they went to go get</br>   a supervisor, and the supervisor spoke to me in private and he gave me</br>   another form and he was like, “Okay, you want a proper hearing? Sign here.”</br>   And I read it and, okay here, then like, man, this is what it is? It took</br>   me getting loud with you. I was a bit belligerent, I'm not going to lie to</br>   you tell you I was the best, as they called me, “detainee.” But I'm going</br>   to fight for my home. I understand I was born in Mexico, but Chicago's my</br>   home, it's my land, that's where I'm from. And whatever I can do to stay</br>   there, I'd be okay.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And so, yeah, that's what it was. But it took me probably a good,</br>   five months before I could see a judge.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were in detention that whole time?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was in detention. I was in a detention center for five months.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Before seeing the judge?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Before seeing the judge. And it wasn't even a formal hearing I</br>   did. It was over the internet and the monitors, surprisingly that day, did</br>   not work. So, all I heard was voices and I told them “No, I want a proper</br>   hearing. I can't see the judge. For all I know there's a guy in the next</br>   room talking to me and there's no judge.” “Okay, well you're going to have</br>   to wait on a whole another six months.” And I'm not going to lie to you,</br>   those detention centers aren't all that pretty, you know what I mean?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I just didn't want to be locked up anymore. That, honestly, that</br>   scared me. I didn't want to do another whole six months. By that point, I</br>   would've done a year just to go see one judge for a bond. Finally, I said,</br>   “Yeah, you know what? Yeah, I want one. I'll take the six months, give me</br>   the six months. Just so I can see a judge.” Surprisingly, there was another</br>   court hearing, I think, a month from then. So, I finally got to see the</br>   judge, but they set the bond at $50,000. And I don't have a $50,000, my</br>   family doesn't have $50,000. So, I sat there. I sat the two and a half</br>   years because I wanted to fight it. Every possible angle that I could</br>   probably touch, I tried it.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I'm a victim of sexual abuse in the United States and there was a</br>   police report made and everything. And I've also been a victim of gang</br>   violence. I was never, you can check my background and everything. I was</br>   never into gangs or anything, but around the area I lived in there was a</br>   bunch of gangs and... I was beat up two or three times bad just by walking</br>   home. And it was all documented, I had police reports and everything. And</br>   because of that I was in therapy for while. My mother sought out a help</br>   from a psychiatrist because of the sexual abuse I had as a child in</br>   California, as a matter of fact.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I took Risperdal and a Ritalin, Risperdal for the anxiety and the</br>   Ritalin and for the ADHD. So, we tried everything. The mental health side,</br>   the mental health asylum, everything. But it was just going to take longer</br>   and longer and longer and I was tired of it. I didn't want to be locked up</br>   anymore. So, finally I just told my mom, “You know what man, that's it, I'm</br>   done. I don't want to do this anymore.” She asked me, “Is this what you</br>   want to do?” And I told her, “Yeah.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: She told me, “You know what? I'd much rather see you over there</br>   and be free then not being able to see you here at all.” Because there was</br>   a lot of people that went to go visit their loved ones and they used to get</br>   picked up. Sometimes they wouldn't even let you see your loved ones and</br>   right away ask you for your identification, your social security card, your</br>   nationality and everything and they would get picked up.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I always told my mom, “Don't ever come visit me. Don't ever</br>   come visit me because if you do, chances are they're going to take you</br>   too.” And you know, that would always break my heart because I would want</br>   to see my mom. I'd want to see my dad and everything, but I wasn't able to.</br>   So, that experience was just horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When you were in the detention center what were the conditions? Did</br>   you have access the medicine you needed? Did you have access to food and</br>   water?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: The company that made the jail was called GEO Corp and they were</br>   actually, I'm not going to lie to you, they actually were pretty good,</br>   health-wise, not so much security-wise. A lot of things would happen in</br>   there that definitely shouldn't have ever happened. But with the food and</br>   everything, it was good. In my opinion it was because of the company. I</br>   feel as though if it was up to the government... Thank God it was an</br>   independent company that was hired by DHS as opposed to if DHS were to make</br>   their own jail, I feel they would be completely different.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It was [Pause] a pleasantly... there's no way to describe it, it</br>   was bad. It was bad, but for what it was I guess it was okay. I don't see</br>   there being an in-between or any pretty way to paint that picture as to how</br>   good or bad it was in there. Because at the end of the day you're deprived</br>   of your freedom. You can't just pick up the phone whenever you want and</br>   call your loved ones because you've got to pay for that too. You got pay</br>   for that. And if you want to take a shower, you have to buy your soap,</br>   right? You've got to buy it yourself, you've got to buy everything. And now</br>   you're becoming a liability for your family, you're becoming another bill.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: You're becoming another bill and that's what I didn't want. So,</br>   that's why I started working. And now, older, I'm becoming another bill.</br>   So, I don't get it. You're taking us away from the jobs that we have and</br>   everything. You know? So, take us back to our country. And I'm not sure if</br>   it this is a fact or not, but I was reading when I first got in here, there</br>   was a time where there wasn't enough field workers for, I think,</br>   avocado—or, not avocado, I think it was oranges or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I remember me saying, “Well, there goes all the deportees.</br>   There goes all the people you guys deported. Where are the people that were</br>   so outraged because we took your jobs? Go ahead, there you go. There are a</br>   lot of vacancies, making these open for those jobs, go ahead, man. All</br>   yours buddy, knock yourself out.”</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But nobody wants to work those jobs, right? You see what I'm</br>   saying though, right?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Definitely. So, how do you feel, do you feel like American…?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I don't want to say I feel like American. Spiritually, me myself,</br>   as an individual, I feel like now that I've been in Mexico and been living</br>   the real life of a real life Mexican—because man, it's hard out here, you</br>   know?—I feel like if I say I'm American, I feel like I'm betraying who I</br>   am. Because I have American… Yes, I'm from... Because even then I can't</br>   even say I'm American cause I'm not from there, that's why I'm here, right?</br>   But the way I feel, yeah, I guess I am what they call me here, el gabacho,</br>   the American, the white boy. Do I feel it? I feel it only because I miss my</br>   home and that's what I want to be in order to be okay over there. I mean,</br>   if that's what I have to be in order to be okay over there and then, okay,</br>   yeah, I'm American.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But when I'm amongst individuals, Mexicans here and everything, my</br>   own people, I'm a Mexican. It still takes me a little while for me to be</br>   able to really integrate myself because to this point, to this day, I still</br>   have trouble expressing myself 100% in Spanish. I always try to better my</br>   Spanish, but it gets to the point where sometimes I can't fully express the</br>   way I feel at times.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: So, I speak in English but then you can't understand me in English</br>   because you speak all Spanish. So, those are the times when I really truly</br>   do feel American more than I feel Mexican. Because if I can't voice and</br>   express my true feelings in my native tongue then that's—my native tongue</br>   is English.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: So, you know what? Now that you do mention it, yeah, I feel more</br>   American now than I do Mexican and it's kind of mixed feelings. Because I'm</br>   trying to forget everything that I was over, that was going on over there,</br>   that I lived over there. But it's hard because I want to go back, I want to</br>   be able to punch in at Cheesecake Factory, and I want to be able to come</br>   home and just be with my family. But yeah, I do feel more American than I</br>   do Mexican and I'm not ashamed to say that's who I am. Short of being born</br>   over there, I'm from over there.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What was your experience when you got back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: My experience when I first arrived in Mexico, when I first got</br>   back in Mexico was surreal, it was a blur. I'm terribly afraid of heights.</br>   That's my fear. Not so much anymore but yeah, heights are not my thing. I</br>   remember being on the plane and it taking a turn, and I remember seeing all</br>   the buildings and I saw everything and I even scooted up in front of my</br>   seat to see and it's like I completely forgot that I was afraid of heights.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I felt happy and I don't know why. I don't know if it was</br>   because I was finally going to be free. And before it turned, before they</br>   told all the people, all the agents or the officials to sit down, they took</br>   the handcuffs off and they took the shackles off and I just, I'm like,</br>   “Whoa, okay, this shit is real. This is real.” And it did that turn and we</br>   finally got down and I saw the... we were passing by all hangars, the</br>   military hangar, the presidential hangar, certain company's hangars and</br>   whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Got off the plane, and I just remember looking back and looking at</br>   my hands and not seeing handcuffs or a police officer right next to me and</br>   I felt happy. But then I got on the phone and I called my mom and she was</br>   just happy that I was out and everything. She started crying and I then</br>   started crying too but then... that was just very mixed emotions. And the</br>   first couple of months, they were all right until I started figuring out</br>   that the individuals who are my family, as a matter of fact, who are</br>   supposed to help me out here were just after the money.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And I feel like somebody's first experience or first impression or</br>   how they've gone about being in Mexico has to do greatly with their support</br>   system in Mexico. And unfortunately, I had the shorter end of the stick. I</br>   felt like I needed to pass by the things I needed to pass in order for me</br>   to get to the point where I am right now in this very point in time, in</br>   this chair, wearing these clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: It wasn't the most prettiest thing. I was homeless for a while. I</br>   didn't have a house. My house was a 2016 Nissan Versa and that's only</br>   because I took a job as an Uber driver and it wasn't even my car, it was</br>   somebody else's. But I couldn't tell that guy it wasn't my car because he</br>   probably wouldn't even have let me keep driving. So, my first, my initial</br>   experience in Mexico was bad, it was bad.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I was lied to, I was deceived, I was stolen from. It's like every</br>   little turn it was always a smack in the head or something. But little by</br>   little I started getting acclimated to everything that was going on. How I</br>   should go about moving in certain areas or how I should talk, how I should</br>   move. Better yet, how to adapt to certain situations.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did the Mexican government provide help in that transition?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: The Mexican government, they provided some help. They provided 50</br>   pesos when I first got here. And they just give me a whole bunch of</br>   pamphlets of school and housing, right? But I feel as though independent</br>   organizations were the ones who ultimately would have helped me a lot more.</br>   When I first got off the plane, they told me about all the resources, all</br>   the help, all the things that their company or their organization did for</br>   other people, deportees. So, I feel like independent organizations would</br>   have helped me more than the Mexican government.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: What can the Mexican government do to help deportees?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Well, I mean, look, when I first got here, apart from them giving</br>   me 50 pesos... In my opinion, the Mexican government can be more supportive</br>   in having—I don't know,—what I was thinking is probably a fund, you know?</br>   Or maybe a fund or some type of little packet. Not saying that we all are</br>   entitled to it, but it'd be good to get here and have a little bit of money</br>   or a place for yourself, or right away giving out jobs or something like</br>   that. I'm not saying that the Mexico City doesn't have jobs for a bilingual</br>   speaker or bilingual people but it's through third party organizations,</br>   outsourcing and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: But if the Mexican government really do want to help then that</br>   would be my suggestion. More jobs, more jobs for people like us. And not</br>   just for people us more so, but that would help out everybody else. Or</br>   simply, when I got here maybe there'd be a little fund that everybody gets,</br>   a certain amount of money to start their own business. Because I did hear</br>   about something like that. That there are help for people that want to</br>   start their business, especially if you're deportees.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Now I still haven't been pointed towards the right direction as to</br>   how to go about doing that. I mean, I've looked for help but I always come</br>   to a dead end. And it varies from city to city. Because somebody who I was</br>   with in the detention center—we left the same day and everything—but he's</br>   from Monterey and he actually he actually got 30,000 pesos from the Mexican</br>   government. I'm not sure what branch it was from or where exactly it came</br>   from, but he showed me everything. He proved it to me, so I know there is</br>   help, but I feel like there is not that much awareness.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I feel like, obviously because of the corruption or anything they</br>   don't want to help us because they much rather keep that money for</br>   themselves then to give it out. So, I feel like more awareness as well. If</br>   there is that help, then let us know. Let us know we have that help. Let us</br>   know you are there and we can help. Not just that we've come here from a</br>   different country and now go ahead, do whatever you can. No, I mean, just</br>   help us out too.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: I'm just wrapping up. Why do you think so many people from Mexico</br>   have a negative perception of returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Because of what their family members tell them. And the reason why</br>   returning deportees have a bad perception or a bad idea or a bad image of</br>   why they shouldn't come back is because well, in the first place, their</br>   family... Every individual has their own story, right? Obviously, that</br>   individual's family has told them the story of why they moved to America.</br>   And if they themselves, if their own family didn't want to live here, that</br>   in its own instills fear in them.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I mean, we're humans, right? We fear the unknown. We fear what we</br>   don't know, especially we fear change. We're creatures of habit. If you</br>   take me out of my element, if you took me out of Chicago, I'm like, “Shit,</br>   I don't know what's going on man.” I didn't know I couldn't walk after I</br>   paid my tacos. I didn't know I had to give back [inaudible 00:25:14], the</br>   glass bottle. I didn't know that. I didn't know I had to pay five pesos if</br>   I want to use the bathroom around here.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: My family painted me a picture of here that it was going to be</br>   horrible. Because that's what they lived, that's what they know. That's the</br>   reason why they moved. Like, “Hey man, living over there is going to be</br>   horrible. Don't go over there, fight the case, stay here. You're not going</br>   to be able to do anything over there, it's so hard. Minimum wage—the pay is</br>   horrible, the jobs are horrible.” And they're feeding you what they know</br>   and what they lived because they don't know any better, they don't know</br>   anything else.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: And for a person who doesn't know a country, then they're going to</br>   take heed to that. If I watch a movie and I tell my friend, “Hey man, don't</br>   watch that movie, that movie is horrible.” Yeah, I watched it, you didn't</br>   and now you're going to take my opinion and apply it to your own beliefs.</br>   Okay, well, I mean, he's my friend he wouldn't lie to me, why would he lie</br>   to me? You're my mom, you're my brother, my sister, whatever. If you say</br>   it's bad, it's bad.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, do you think a lot of deportees, when they return, turn to</br>   crime?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: When they return to what, I'm sorry?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: To Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I think a lot of the deportees, when they come back, yes. But I</br>   think more about their family—the inability to help your family member, the</br>   person who you love is one of the most horrible... it's a horrible feeling,</br>   not being able to help, let alone help one of your family members.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I remember my mom crying over the phone and telling me, “Man, I</br>   just want to help you. I wish I could just go and get you.“ Or, “Man, I'm</br>   going to ask around and see if I can find a lawyer and everything.” Oh my</br>   god, don't let me get started on the lawyers over there. They're not quite</br>   good people, right? Because they take advantage of that as well. But that's</br>   another conversation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, on that piece about helping families. What do you think the US</br>   government can do to help Mexican deportees and the families that they</br>   leave behind? You left your family.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: If it'd be up to me, everybody would be together and there would</br>   be no borders and no laws. But what the US government can do to help</br>   families in that position is if one of your family members is in a</br>   detention center, you automatically— there should be a law, there should be</br>   a rule, whatever man—can go and visit. You can go visit and get visited by</br>   anybody who they want and they can't touch them. It doesn't matter if it's</br>   a federal, state law or whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: You can't deprive somebody of their family like that, man. I</br>   understand you're not from here, and okay, they're in deportation</br>   proceedings and everything, but that's why there's so many fights in there,</br>   you know? That's where there's so much aggression, so much tension, because</br>   you don't know what's going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Literally, I spoke to a person who said, “Man, if I do bad things</br>   here they're going to want to keep me here.” What type of mentality is</br>   that? That they rather commit crimes while in detention so they can stay in</br>   the United States but not even that, they are going to be locked up.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: So, that reality, that part where their mind has set on, “Okay</br>   well, I'd rather be in jail here then go back to my home country. Because</br>   I'm going to be, at least, with my family here, so they can go visit me and</br>   stuff like that.” That's very.., that's horrible. So yeah, that. That would</br>   be awesome if somebody is in detention, if somebody is detained, they can</br>   get visits from their family. Just people who are detained, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Just wanting to hug your mom—</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Yeah. Because a visit does all the difference, man. You know what</br>   I mean? Seeing that little help, it's like a beacon of hope, you know?</br>   Okay, well, one day or hopefully or just keeping that alive.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: I think that's all the questions I have right now, I might come up</br>   with more later to ask you again. But right now, do you have anything on</br>   your mind that you want to share or talk about?</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: Man, it's been awhile since I spoke about any of this, but I feel</br>   I've let everything... or for now because I have a lot, a lot more. But for</br>   now, I feel like it was good. It's like a little therapy session as well,</br>   man. Honestly, to be quite frank with you, that's what I was looking for,</br>   man. Because I don't really have any friends like that, and I don't know</br>   anybody out here like that and it's just great to finally speak and be</br>   heard.</br> </br> </br>   Rodolfo: I know it's your job and I know it's your school and everything</br>   but man, I feel like you really were listening to me and thank you. Thank</br>   you man, really.</br> </div><\p></p>
