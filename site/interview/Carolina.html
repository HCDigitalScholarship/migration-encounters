   led to you coming to the US the first time, and how old you were, and what<br>
   your first impressions were, what motivated the move?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: Well, I was living in Mexico with my grandmother till I was five,<br>
   and my mother was living in the US, so I went to reunite with her. And,<br>
   well, I used someone else's papers, so it wasn't really hard getting to the<br>
   US.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So you just got in a car and drove there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How long had you been separated from your mom?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: Five years, well, almost four.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Must have been hard to leave your grandma.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: She's probably what you thought of as your mother.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: She was.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And did your mom come to the US just to make a better life?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: Yeah, whenever I was little, I was really sick, so she didn't<br>
   have enough money to pay for all the medicine and all the equipment I had<br>
   to use. So that's why she left.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anne: I see. What kind of sickness did you have?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I don't really remember. I don't really remember.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you're well now.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I'm healthy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Good. That's great. So when you went over to your mom, to see your</br>   mom, and reunite with her, did you recognize her?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I didn't. I was like, &quot;Who's this lady?&quot; [Laughs]. And I wanted</br>   to go back to Mexico immediately, but...</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What city did you end up?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was living in Arkansas, in Wickes, Arkansas.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And presumably you didn't know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I didn't. I didn't know any English, but my mom had a friend who</br>   spoke really good English, so she was the one who taught me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, she did?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So even before you went to school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah, I knew a little English whenever I was in school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. So then you went to school in the States. What was that</br>   like?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was in two different schools. In elementary, it was really</br>   good. It was really nice. And then you could say middle school, that was</br>   whenever I moved to a different city, it was hard. I was the only Mexican</br>   girl. They would usually send messages telling me to kill myself, that I</br>   wasn't worth it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They would send messages for you to kill yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah. Yeah, because, well, they told me that they were better off</br>   without me, well, with my race. I was the only Mexican girl, the only</br>   dark-skinned, and they would be like, &quot;Oh, you're the fly to the milk, in</br>   the glass of milk.&quot; It was awful.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I didn't want to go to school. I was depressed. With all those</br>   messages, I got really depressed. And I just tried to move forward, but it</br>   was really, really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you were living with your mother?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was living with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Anyone else? You have siblings?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I do. With my siblings, my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Older or younger siblings?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: They were younger. But since they were born there, it wasn't</br>   really a problem. But since I was an immigrant, that's what led them to say</br>   all those things.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you enjoyed elementary school though?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I enjoyed elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But it was just hard to start a brand new school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was really hard. I tried fitting in and it never worked</br>   [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you make it through middle school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then high school, how was that?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: High school, well, I wasn't really involved with anyone. I was by</br>   myself. Then I had a couple of friends who actually cared about me and was</br>   like, &quot;Oh, don't listen to them.&quot; But besides that, I didn't really like</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far did you get in school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was going into 10th whenever I came back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. When you were in school, did you do well in school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was, but then I got sick again and they never... Oh, the</br>   doctors didn't know what was wrong with me, so I missed... We're in school</br>   like nine months, right? I was in school for two months on all the school</br>   cycle.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Which grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Eighth.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what was wrong with you then? Do you know?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: The doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me. They'd be like,</br>   &quot;Oh, no, well, you don't have anything.&quot; They ran tests, they did this,</br>   they did that, and they couldn't find what was wrong with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And eventually you got better.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes and no. I still suffer from stomach pains. My head will</br>   constantly hurt, really strong migraines, but they're not migraines at the</br>   same time. And my bones will hurt at times. I can't move. So it's really</br>   weird. And they don't know what it is.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow, that must be hard to live with. Right. Yeah. When you were at</br>   school, did you do any extracurriculars?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I played basketball. I did track. Yeah, I was really active. They</br>   didn't really involve me in anything in basketball, but I tried.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were the teachers more receptive to you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: There was one teacher who didn't like me. I don't know if it was</br>   because of my race or something, because with everybody else she was really</br>   cool. If they didn't have their work done, she would just pass them. And if</br>   I didn't do my work right, she would put a bad grade on my work and she</br>   wouldn't tell me why. Or I would do my homework and they wouldn't, and yet</br>   I would still have a bad grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was home life like?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: My mom spent most of her time working so we could have better</br>   things, we could have something better than she did. So she spent most of</br>   her time working. So we stayed at home most of the time alone. And on</br>   weekends we would go out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you feel like you were taking care of your siblings a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No, not really.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you first went to Arkansas, you were in one city, and you</br>   felt more accepted.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there more—</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: There were more Mexicans there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. And then you moved to the second city, and you said it was</br>   primarily just white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No racial diversity at all, just you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No. Yeah, it was just me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were the face of diversity?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It must have been very, very hard.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was really, really hard. The people there weren't used to</br>   Mexicans. So, you went into a store and they'd look at you really weird or</br>   angry. It was hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you want to go back? Did you want to go back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: At that time, I didn't, I wanted to go back to the city I was in</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, where you had a nice childhood, earlier childhood?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had friends back there?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So tell me, you said you left the US in 10th grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How did that happen?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: What do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Mostly because we got tired of the same situation. We had family</br>   there, but they lived really far away. So we didn't really communicate. We</br>   were alone. It was just me, my mom, and my brother and sister. And that was</br>   it. And we felt lonely. We felt like we didn't have anybody there. So we</br>   decided to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So the whole family came back together?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes. But my siblings are constantly going back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, because they're US citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So they can go back and forth?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I'm 18.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're 18. So, that was just a couple of years ago?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. And when your siblings go back, who do they stay with?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: With their dad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, with their dad. So, you had a stepfather then?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. But didn't he live with you all?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: He did. And then my mom and him got separated, so that was a</br>   different story.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So she came back. So the kids just go to visit him?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. I see. So once you came back, was it easier for you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was a lot better. I felt at home right away, and my mom</br>   sometimes tells me we should go back. I don't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you live with other relatives besides just your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: My grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your grandma. So her mother?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, the one who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes, the one who raised me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that must have been nice to see her.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was really nice. Whenever we got here, she cried because of</br>   happiness I guess. She was happy. She cried.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you go back to school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I went to school for two semesters, and then I dropped out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So you still have not graduated from high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I haven't. I'm working on that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. And you're working, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I am.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But what kind of work?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It's at TeleTech. It's a phone—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Call center?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Oh yeah, a call center.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How is that?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It's really good. I'm liking it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long have you done it?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: This is my second week.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah, I just turned 18.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you work before then or is this your first job?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I worked in a hog farm over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In a hog farm?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So the hog farm must've been outside of the city?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No, we lived close to it actually.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay, so you're liking this better than the hog farm?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes and no. It was really nice working in a hog farm. I</br>   experienced a lot of things.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what do you do in a hog farm? I'm sorry. I never worked at one.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Well, we were working for the company, Cargill.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Which one?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: The Cargill, that was the company. And we had to breed the hogs.</br>   We got to experience births, give them their shots, process them, and they</br>   would eventually leave.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And get slaughtered?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I don't know [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you like the hogs?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I really didn’t.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were they big?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Oh, they were huge. They were really huge.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it hard to manage them?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No. I guess they already knew the process because they stayed</br>   with us for a couple of months and then they would leave.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It's a really different experience.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Different, yeah. Wow, so you've enjoyed coming back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I have. I felt more at home.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. It seems like there weren't a lot of positive things for you in</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No, there wasn't. It was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are you still in contact with any of your friends from there?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I am. I have this friend, well, she's my mom's friend. She's</br>   really popular there, because she was with the DACA and everything. Her</br>   name was Rosa Velazquez. Yeah. So she was really into all the politics and</br>   stuff. She went to Washington and everything. We were in contact with her,</br>   and well, my friends from school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, from the earlier school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And maybe the couple that were nice to you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's good that you still have that. What are your current dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: My dreams? Well, I want to finish school and I want to become a</br>   surgeon.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You want to become a doctor and then become a surgeon?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.

So then you went to school in the States. What was that</br>   like?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was in two different schools. In elementary, it was really</br>   good. It was really nice. And then you could say middle school, that was</br>   whenever I moved to a different city, it was hard. I was the only Mexican</br>   girl. They would usually send messages telling me to kill myself, that I</br>   wasn't worth it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They would send messages for you to kill yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah. Yeah, because, well, they told me that they were better off</br>   without me, well, with my race. I was the only Mexican girl, the only</br>   dark-skinned, and they would be like, &quot;Oh, you're the fly to the milk, in</br>   the glass of milk.&quot; It was awful.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I didn't want to go to school. I was depressed. With all those</br>   messages, I got really depressed.

I was by</br>   myself. Then I had a couple of friends who actually cared about me and was</br>   like, &quot;Oh, don't listen to them.&quot; But besides that, I didn't really like</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far did you get in school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was going into 10th whenever I came back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.

They'd be like,</br>   &quot;Oh, no, well, you don't have anything.&quot; They ran tests, they did this,</br>   they did that, and they couldn't find what was wrong with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And eventually you got better.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes and no. I still suffer from stomach pains. My head will</br>   constantly hurt, really strong migraines, but they're not migraines at the</br>   same time. And my bones will hurt at times. I can't move. So it's really</br>   weird. And they don't know what it is.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow, that must be hard to live with. Right. Yeah. When you were at</br>   school, did you do any extracurriculars?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I played basketball. I did track. Yeah, I was really active.

And when your siblings go back, who do they stay with?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: With their dad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, with their dad. So, you had a stepfather then?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. But didn't he live with you all?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: He did. And then my mom and him got separated, so that was a</br>   different story.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So she came back. So the kids just go to visit him?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. I see. So once you came back, was it easier for you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was a lot better. I felt at home right away, and my mom</br>   sometimes tells me we should go back. I don't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you live with other relatives besides just your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: My grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your grandma.

So you still have not graduated from high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I haven't. I'm working on that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. And you're working, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I am.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But what kind of work?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It's at TeleTech.

I never worked at one.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Well, we were working for the company, Cargill.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Which one?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: The Cargill, that was the company. And we had to breed the hogs.</br>   We got to experience births, give them their shots, process them, and they</br>   would eventually leave.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And get slaughtered?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I don't know [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you like the hogs?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I really didn’t.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were they big?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Oh, they were huge. They were really huge.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it hard to manage them?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No. I guess they already knew the process because they stayed</br>   with us for a couple of months and then they would leave.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It's a really different experience.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Different, yeah. Wow, so you've enjoyed coming back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I have. I felt more at home.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.

She's</br>   really popular there, because she was with the DACA and everything. Her</br>   name was Rosa Velazquez. Yeah. So she was really into all the politics and</br>   stuff. She went to Washington and everything.

   Anne: And what was wrong with you then? Do you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: The doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me. They'd be like,<br>
   &quot;Oh, no, well, you don't have anything.&quot; They ran tests, they did this,<br>
   they did that, and they couldn't find what was wrong with me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And eventually you got better.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: Yes and no. I still suffer from stomach pains. My head will<br>
   constantly hurt, really strong migraines, but they're not migraines at the<br>
   same time. And my bones will hurt at times. I can't move. So it's really<br>
   weird. And they don't know what it is.<br>

   whenever I moved to a different city, it was hard. I was the only Mexican<br>

   wasn't worth it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: They would send messages for you to kill yourself?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carolina: Yeah. Yeah, because, well, they told me that they were better off<br>
   without me, well, with my race. I was the only Mexican girl, the only<br>
   dark-skinned, and they would be like, &quot;Oh, you're the fly to the milk, in<br>
   the glass of milk.&quot; It was awful.<br>

You have siblings?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I do. With my siblings, my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Older or younger siblings?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: They were younger. But since they were born there, it wasn't</br>   really a problem. But since I was an immigrant, that's what led them to say</br>   all those things.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you enjoyed elementary school though?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I enjoyed elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But it was just hard to start a brand new school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was really hard. I tried fitting in and it never worked</br>   [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you make it through middle school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then high school, how was that?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: High school, well, I wasn't really involved with anyone. I was by</br>   myself. Then I had a couple of friends who actually cared about me and was</br>   like, &quot;Oh, don't listen to them.&quot; But besides that, I didn't really like</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far did you get in school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was going into 10th whenever I came back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. When you were in school, did you do well in school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I was, but then I got sick again and they never... Oh, the</br>   doctors didn't know what was wrong with me, so I missed... We're in school</br>   like nine months, right? I was in school for two months on all the school</br>   cycle.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Which grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Eighth.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what was wrong with you then? Do you know?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: The doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me. They'd be like,</br>   &quot;Oh, no, well, you don't have anything.&quot; They ran tests, they did this,</br>   they did that, and they couldn't find what was wrong with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And eventually you got better.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes and no. I still suffer from stomach pains. My head will</br>   constantly hurt, really strong migraines, but they're not migraines at the</br>   same time. And my bones will hurt at times. I can't move. So it's really</br>   weird. And they don't know what it is.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow, that must be hard to live with. Right. Yeah. When you were at</br>   school, did you do any extracurriculars?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I played basketball. I did track. Yeah, I was really active. They</br>   didn't really involve me in anything in basketball, but I tried.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were the teachers more receptive to you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: There was one teacher who didn't like me. I don't know if it was</br>   because of my race or something, because with everybody else she was really</br>   cool. If they didn't have their work done, she would just pass them. And if</br>   I didn't do my work right, she would put a bad grade on my work and she</br>   wouldn't tell me why. Or I would do my homework and they wouldn't, and yet</br>   I would still have a bad grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was home life like?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: My mom spent most of her time working so we could have better</br>   things, we could have something better than she did. So she spent most of</br>   her time working. So we stayed at home most of the time alone. And on</br>   weekends we would go out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you feel like you were taking care of your siblings a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No, not really.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you first went to Arkansas, you were in one city, and you</br>   felt more accepted.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there more—</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: There were more Mexicans there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. And then you moved to the second city, and you said it was</br>   primarily just white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No racial diversity at all, just you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No. Yeah, it was just me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were the face of diversity?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It must have been very, very hard.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was really, really hard. The people there weren't used to</br>   Mexicans. So, you went into a store and they'd look at you really weird or</br>   angry. It was hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you want to go back? Did you want to go back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: At that time, I didn't, I wanted to go back to the city I was in</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, where you had a nice childhood, earlier childhood?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had friends back there?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So tell me, you said you left the US in 10th grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How did that happen?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: What do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Mostly because we got tired of the same situation. We had family</br>   there, but they lived really far away. So we didn't really communicate. We</br>   were alone. It was just me, my mom, and my brother and sister. And that was</br>   it. And we felt lonely. We felt like we didn't have anybody there. So we</br>   decided to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So the whole family came back together?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes. But my siblings are constantly going back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, because they're US citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So they can go back and forth?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I'm 18.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're 18. So, that was just a couple of years ago?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. And when your siblings go back, who do they stay with?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: With their dad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, with their dad. So, you had a stepfather then?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. But didn't he live with you all?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: He did. And then my mom and him got separated, so that was a</br>   different story.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So she came back. So the kids just go to visit him?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. I see. So once you came back, was it easier for you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was a lot better. I felt at home right away, and my mom</br>   sometimes tells me we should go back. I don't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you live with other relatives besides just your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: My grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your grandma. So her mother?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, the one who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes, the one who raised me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that must have been nice to see her.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It was really nice. Whenever we got here, she cried because of</br>   happiness I guess. She was happy. She cried.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you go back to school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I went to school for two semesters, and then I dropped out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So you still have not graduated from high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I haven't. I'm working on that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. And you're working, I guess?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I am.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But what kind of work?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It's at TeleTech. It's a phone—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Call center?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Oh yeah, a call center.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How is that?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It's really good. I'm liking it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long have you done it?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: This is my second week.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah, I just turned 18.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you work before then or is this your first job?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I worked in a hog farm over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In a hog farm?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So the hog farm must've been outside of the city?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No, we lived close to it actually.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay, so you're liking this better than the hog farm?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes and no. It was really nice working in a hog farm. I</br>   experienced a lot of things.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what do you do in a hog farm? I'm sorry. I never worked at one.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Well, we were working for the company, Cargill.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Which one?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: The Cargill, that was the company. And we had to breed the hogs.</br>   We got to experience births, give them their shots, process them, and they</br>   would eventually leave.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And get slaughtered?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I don't know [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you like the hogs?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I really didn’t.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were they big?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Oh, they were huge. They were really huge.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it hard to manage them?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No. I guess they already knew the process because they stayed</br>   with us for a couple of months and then they would leave.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: It's a really different experience.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Different, yeah. Wow, so you've enjoyed coming back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I have. I felt more at home.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. It seems like there weren't a lot of positive things for you in</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No, there wasn't. It was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are you still in contact with any of your friends from there?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I am. I have this friend, well, she's my mom's friend. She's</br>   really popular there, because she was with the DACA and everything. Her</br>   name was Rosa Velazquez. Yeah. So she was really into all the politics and</br>   stuff. She went to Washington and everything. We were in contact with her,</br>   and well, my friends from school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, from the earlier school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And maybe the couple that were nice to you?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's good that you still have that. What are your current dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: My dreams? Well, I want to finish school and I want to become a</br>   surgeon.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You want to become a doctor and then become a surgeon?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yes. I'm hoping I can do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, a lot of hard work but—</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's nice that your company will help out with school.</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: Yeah, it is. It's a really good company.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how many more semesters in high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: I need four more. It'd be two more years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: And then just college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: University and college. So that's wonderful. So is there anything you</br>   want to say about your experiences in the US and coming back to Mexico</br>   before we end? Anything you want to share that you haven't said?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No, no, I don't think so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No?</br> </br> </br>   Carolina: No. I just wish people would be different and not be so racist. I</br>   mean, we live through the same thing. We're all human, and it's like we're</br>   going to eventually need something from one another.</br> </div><\p>
