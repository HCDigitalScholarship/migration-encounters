 <br>
 <br>
   Dan: It was work, basically.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Isabel: And you crossed with a work visa or family visa?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: It was a family visa, yeah, my mom and my sister.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I know you went to the US for three years and then went back to</br>   Mexico. How long were you in Mexico the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: For about two years, three years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Two years, three years. And then at point you were six or seven?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Then on your second trip to the US, do you remember migrating to</br>   the US a little better?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yes. It was on a working visa. It was with my family, my mom’s visa.</br>   And I studied middle school with the fifth grade. And I still have all my,</br>   how do you call it, school reports. Yeah. I still have all those.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me about school, what teachers were like, what your</br>   friends were like?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, at the beginning I remember there was a lot of ... Well, now</br>   it's called bullying. Back then, it was just making fun of. ... because I</br>   didn't know how to speak English well. I didn't know how to communicate. I</br>   didn't know how to make myself understood. It was just a lot of language</br>   barrier, I would say.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was the school helpful with language, or did you have to learn it</br>   on your own?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, high school that's when I got ESL, which was English as a Second</br>   Language. And I remember teachers tried to help. That's when I got the</br>   help. But before then, it was just hardly.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So they didn't have any ESL for elementary or middle school?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow. How did you pick up English, then?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, just hanging out with my classmates. And my sister was with me</br>   and my cousin, so we would make our own little group and we would hang out</br>   with all the Hispanic guys and then we'd encourage each other to just start</br>   talking English. We had to start somehow.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And when you said there was bullying because of the language</br>   barrier, was that why you formed those groups with people who also spoke</br>   Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, yeah. You feel more comfortable with Hispanic people. They try</br>   not to make fun of you because they know how it feels. They've being in</br>   that situation before. We try to help each other and just stick together.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. And I'm sorry, what city and town was this in, just so we</br>   can repeat it?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: This was probably, I would say, when I was in fifth grade, when I was</br>   in eighth, ninth, ten, eleven, and twelve.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. And during that time, did you like school or what did you</br>   like to do in your free time?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Back then, it was very famous going roller skating.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, really?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: We would go roller skating, my sister and myself and my cousin. Then,</br>   I will play soccer as well and just going out to movies. It was not much to</br>   do back then because you needed transportation. It was far sometimes, so</br>   they will have to come and pick us up, but we managed.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You finished high school in the US and you started working then.</br>   Can you tell me a bit about working in the US, any memories you have?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, I remember when I was at my former job as a customer service</br>   agent, I feel so proud due to the fact that I was sitting next to college</br>   students that studied so many years in college and I was earning more than</br>   them because of a language difference and a shift differential. I was like,</br>   I didn't have to study that much and I'm earning more. I guess it was one</br>   of the satisfactions, but obviously, you have to work for it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. And at this point, you did have a resident status?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: That is correct, yes. I had the permit.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So you didn't have to deal with any of the fear.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you know people who were undocumented or lived with that fear?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yes. All the Hispanic community, at one point you meet somebody that</br>   it is undocumented and they don't have the proper documentation to work.</br>   Yeah, you can see them being a little bit afraid of committing a crime,</br>   running a red light or speeding because for any reason, they might pull you</br>   over and your dream might be over.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Speaking of the dreams and what people are hoping to do in</br>   the US, did you have any dreams, what you wanted to accomplish in the US at</br>   that age?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, it's like any kid that wants your mom to be in a very stable</br>   situation. I always wanted to buy a house for my mom and just give her</br>   peace of mind. But at one point, I tried to do it, but she always lived</br>   with my sisters. But I tried. I didn't accomplish it. I was not able to</br>   make it, but it was part of my plans.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. What do you think were some of the obstacles in terms of</br>   achieving that next level that you were hoping to?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, at one point everybody—when I said everybody, I'm talking about</br>   my mom, my dad, and my sisters. We were able to qualify to be American</br>   citizens after so long being a permanent resident. And in my mind, it was</br>   like, &quot;Why am I going to be showing a visa going to my own country?&quot; That</br>   was the only reason that I didn't want to go for it. Now I regret it, but I</br>   just didn't want to do it because, I guess, lack of information, not enough</br>   information that I was or I wasn't going to need that. And time went by and</br>   I regret it now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And so you were mentioning at this time that you didn't have as</br>   much of a fear of authorities because you were a resident. And you said you</br>   didn't want to have a visa for your own country. So you're saying when you</br>   go back to Mexico, you were going to have a visa. You wanted to be a</br>   Mexican citizen—</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: ... and a US resident. But then you said you regret it. Do you mind</br>   going into your last time in the US when you had your company and then when</br>   you were undocumented? Maybe what brought you back to Mexico and then how</br>   you crossed the border for the last time?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, when I crossed the border the last time, that was back in 2009.</br>   I was married already and I had my child. My wife was pregnant with my</br>   daughter. The violence and the economic situation here was to a point that</br>   it was not standable no more. My dad came over. He was an American citizen</br>   by then, and he drove us to the border. And I crossed the border in an</br>   automobile with my sister and my nephews. And just the officer were like,</br>   &quot;You American citizen?&quot; &quot;Yes, I am.&quot; &quot;Where were you born?&quot; &quot;Dallas,</br>   Texas.&quot; And he says, &quot;What hospital?&quot; &quot;Parkland.&quot; And said, &quot;Okay. Go, go,</br>   go.&quot; They didn't check anything, and that was after 9/11, which the</br>   security shouldn't be a little tighter? And then my wife came across the</br>   border with my father and they didn't have any issues. We didn't have the</br>   necessity of walking down the mountain or going through ... risk our lives</br>   like other people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Would you recommend migrating even now when there is the</br>   possibility of risking of your life and more dangerous paths? Or do you</br>   think it's only worth migrating if you can do it safely?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: It's worth migrating if you can do it safely because your life is not</br>   worth it. Walking through the night and long distance, I haven't</br>   experienced it, but I have friends that they told me that they encounter</br>   wild pigs and snakes and they're not here anymore. Just try to go ahead and</br>   have a better life. In here, in Mexico, my advantage is that I speak</br>   English. No matter how old I am, I still have a few doors open. I struggle,</br>   but I can manage, and I can survive. I can go by. But all those people that</br>   they really need to have a better life, whatever they're going to spend on</br>   crossing the border, risking their lives, they should invest that money</br>   into their education and then they have a better option of having a better</br>   job and make themselves worth that they really want to be worth.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. I think that's important because it can be a really dangerous</br>   journey it is what stories seem to say. When you got to the US for the last</br>   time, you went through car and didn't have any issues. How did you start</br>   running your own company? Do you mind telling me a bit about that?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Sure. Obviously, back then I didn't have no documents. I start working</br>   with this guy as a helper. He was a contractor for Home Depot putting the</br>   countertops, taking off the Formica, the wood countertops and putting</br>   marble or granite. I was doing that with him for about a year, but we were</br>   looking how other people in that same house were putting hardwood floors,</br>   painting, and doing this and that. I was gathering their info. It was like,</br>   &quot;Hey, this is your own business?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Okay. How much do you charge the</br>   square footage of our engineering wood floors?&quot; &quot;Okay. I'll let you have it</br>   for $1.50.&quot; So I start getting all that information. And at one point, the</br>   guy that I was working with, he moved. He bought his own house, but it was</br>   way too far. So he invited me over and he said, &quot;Hey, I'll pay you rent on</br>   an apartment nearby, but I need your help.&quot; And I was like, &quot;No.&quot; And at</br>   that moment, I printed my own business cards and I knew how to paint, so I</br>   was painting houses. I was painting inside interiors, outside exteriors.</br>   And I started selling out other people's jobs. For instance, I would say,</br>   &quot;Hey, I'm looking you're remodeling your house. I can do the engineering</br>   hardwood floors for $2.50.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, do you have a catalog?&quot; So I</br>   will run to ... By then, I knew where the hardware stores were, the</br>   outlets, and they will give me a good rate. If the square footage was</br>   $1.00, I would resell it for $1.50 or $1.15. And that how I was making out</br>   my money. I would give somebody else the job, making money out of them, and</br>   just making money out of the material. That's how I was making money. All</br>   of a sudden, when I least expected, I was doing electricity, I was doing</br>   plumbing, I was doing the sprinkler system. I was just doing pretty much</br>   everything around the house, concrete, shingles, roofing. I was subscribed</br>   with an insurance company. I believe it was Allstate Farm where all the</br>   damages would give it to me and they will pay me straight up. I was there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow. That was just being so resourceful and connected with people,</br>   putting it together kind of like the American hustle.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Definitely. Yes. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, that's really cool. Going off of that, one thing we're</br>   focusing on in the interviews is talking about how you may have been shaped</br>   by the US and by Mexico. Do you think that any values or behavior or</br>   mindsets in America shaped who you are or what you have accomplished or</br>   done?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yes. I'm very organized. Obviously, that came from my parents. I'm</br>   very perfectionist. Yes, definitely. In here, if you go around the</br>   buildings anywhere, pick a street, whenever they paint a building, you can</br>   see a bunch of dripping on the floor on the sidewalks. That's where I make</br>   the difference in my job. If I do something, I do it better, and people</br>   like it. And even treat with a person. You say &quot;Hi,&quot; you say, &quot;Good</br>   afternoon,&quot; &quot;Good morning,&quot; and you get yourself to know by other people as</br>   an educated, respected person. Not everybody's like this, and I learn it</br>   from the States. You treat people the way you want to be treated. And</br>   that's basically where I got my reputation from. You treat everybody the</br>   way you want to be treated no matter where they're at, no matter who you</br>   are, no matter who they are. That's my motto.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I think that's incredible and I think it shows in the company you</br>   were able to make. Could you tell me, then, you were using these values,</br>   you were creating a company, you were creating jobs for other people in the</br>   US, and then you were deported and had this experience with law</br>   enforcement. Can you describe that for me?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yes. It was this lady where I went over and gave her an estimate. And</br>   she offered to give me her credit card to go ahead and buy the material.</br>   When I bought the material, it was more money that we quoted, but I told</br>   her that it could vary. I gave her all the material. I gave her all the</br>   receipts, and she was not happy about it. She went over and accused me of</br>   credit card abuse. I got an attorney and it was like, &quot;Hey, don't worry</br>   about it. I already got you a deal. It's only going to be 10 days in jail.</br>   And it's going to be only weekends.&quot; And like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Immigration doesn't</br>   work on weekends, so I will turn myself in on a Friday night and then I</br>   will come out on Monday 12:01 in the morning so it will count four days. I</br>   turned myself in and when I was about to get ready to get out, I called the</br>   guards and say, &quot;Hey, I need to take a shower because I'm about to go to</br>   work.&quot; So they let me out. Took my shower, went back to my cell. And then</br>   about twelve midnight, they called me up and say, &quot;Hey, Cabrero, come</br>   down.&quot; So I went down. They're like, &quot;Man, I cannot let you out because you</br>   have an INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] hold.&quot; I'm like,</br>   &quot;What?&quot; They were like, &quot;Yeah, you have an immigration hold.&quot; &quot;No, not</br>   really.&quot; That's when I lost my house, I lost my trucks, my trailers, my</br>   tools, my home, everything.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You were living with your family?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: I was already with my wife and my kids at my own property. I was at my</br>   own house. She had to let everything go. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm curious, you were doing time in jail for this credit card</br>   infraction that this woman accused you of on the weekends. Is that</br>   something that normally happens?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, the attorney that I got, he knew that I didn't have documents at</br>   that moment, so he's just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm going to try to make a</br>   deal.&quot; He made a deal of—there's a title that you call this, work</br>   release—that you turn yourself in on the weekends and then you go back to</br>   work throughout the week. And then you turn back on the weekend and turn</br>   yourself in. And that's what is supposed to happen, but I don't know how in</br>   the world they knew I was there and I don't know what time they put the</br>   hold on me. And then when I got there ... Well, when I tried to get out,</br>   they told me I couldn't. They said, &quot;But don't worry. If they don't come to</br>   pick you up, INS, by 8:00 in the morning, we'll let you go.&quot; And I had my</br>   truck, everything on the parking lot. By, I guess it was 8:01, immigration</br>   came and then the lady at the reception say, &quot;Hey, you want me to call the</br>   other guys?” He's like, &quot;No, I just came for that guy.&quot; And yeah, it was a</br>   little bit rude. I treat them the way he was treating me. He was asking me</br>   all these sorts of questions. I told him to talk to my attorney. And then</br>   we got to Dallas, Texas at immigration offices, and I got left there all</br>   night, basically, until I started yelling and screaming, and they said,</br>   &quot;Oh! We forgot about you.&quot; They took me to a local jail to stay there</br>   overnight. And then the next morning, that's when they just told me I was</br>   going to be able to see an immigration judge. I think I waited for a couple</br>   of months, three months. I turned myself in May ... it was May the 14th. My</br>   father passed away May the 21st, and I was not there. Just a bunch of</br>   things ran through my mind. But when I went to see the judge, they told me,</br>   &quot;Hey, you were told that they were going to give you five years straight if</br>   you would come back.&quot; And I served two years and a half. I was two years</br>   and a half in jail at the border. It was Raymondville by Harlingen. I was</br>   there working out, building myself up. I had to see the bright side. You</br>   cannot focus on the negative things or else you get destroyed. I always try</br>   to joke about sad situations because if I focus into the negative things,</br>   nothing good comes out of it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. No. That is a really ... Honestly, I can only imagine a</br>   really difficult time. You thought you were going in for a small ten days</br>   in jail—you're going to keep on working, still have your job, your house,</br>   your family. And the next thing you know, everything's being ripped from</br>   you. And that's honestly ... Thank you for sharing. That's a really</br>   difficult thing to rehash. That is one of the stories we're trying to tell</br>   is great people who are contributing to the US economy who are acting as</br>   full citizens, doing everything right like you were, and doing everything</br>   ... You know what I mean? Living a great American lifestyle.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: I still have my tax returns, everything. I was about to burn them up a</br>   couple of days ago because I found them. And I was like, I don't know if I</br>   should burn them down or what. And it was like, &quot;Eh, I'm just going to keep</br>   them.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Doing that and having that perfectionist tendency.</br>   Everything's perfectly done. And then serving time, doing what you were</br>   supposed to do, serving time for the crime, for whatever this person</br>   accused you of. And then because of your undocumented status, that becoming</br>   ... pretty much serving time for a crime you didn't commit is kind of like</br>   how we were seeing it. Taking someone who is in no way a criminal and then</br>   treating them as such.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. Because it was her word against mine when I said, &quot;Hey, she gave</br>   me an authorization to purchase all the material.&quot; And then showing the</br>   judge a sheet of paper that I quoted her how much would it be plus the</br>   material and that not being enough proof that she authorized it. They</br>   showed the videos at Home Depot where I was buying the material and I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, I didn't buy nothing for myself. Everything is for you. This is</br>   the receipts. How many items are in the receipts? This is how many items</br>   are in your house.&quot; I didn't charge nothing more, nothing less, and I told</br>   you, &quot;I have no control over the prices. If you went over the…,&quot; I would</br>   say, &quot;the quoted price verbally, reality was another, but I had no control</br>   over that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. And I feel like that also is fairly common when buying</br>   material for a house. There's the budget and then there's what it actually</br>   ends up being. Then that's not in your control.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That sounds ... I wonder, do you think she knew of your</br>   undocumented status? Do you think she knew what this would mean?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: She found out because my mom, my sisters went to talk to her.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: They told her and said, &quot;Hey, he didn't do nothing wrong and you're</br>   accusing him of something that he didn't commit. How much do you want to</br>   just take off the charges, just say that it was a miscommunication?&quot; And my</br>   mom told her that consequences of what could happen and she didn't care.</br>   She proceeded.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Who has that kind of hate in their heart? I don't know. That's just</br>   feels really selfish on her part.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right. I don't know what she was going through. I don't know what she</br>   thought, but I was very clear. And then I tried to tell her, &quot;If you don't</br>   want the job, I can return the items. I have the receipts and they can put</br>   back on your credit card. It will be no problem.&quot; And when I saw that she</br>   was really going through it, I told her, I said, &quot;You know what? I can pay</br>   you some money for wasting your time, for the hustle, and just to be there</br>   at the wrong time, at the wrong moment if you want to call it that way.&quot;</br>   And she said, &quot;No, I don't want anything out of you.&quot; I don't know. But at</br>   that moment, that's when my mom and my sisters went and talked to her. They</br>   went and talked to her even though the attorney told her not to get in</br>   touch with her. It can be misconception, a misunderstanding, but they went</br>   over and did it anyway. But she didn't want to budge out.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It sounds like when you presented your case, there was video</br>   evidence, you had all the receipts. Do you think that there was any bias?</br>   Do you think there was any discrimination because of your identity?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: She was Hispanic as well.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: She was Hispanic as well?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. Well, she was half American, half Hispanic. She didn't know how</br>   to speak Spanish, but I believe her last name was Hispanic. But I just</br>   don't know. I cannot say anything on her behalf.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Or the judge's.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right. But the only thing I can say was what it went through my mind,</br>   what I went through, what I did, what I tried to do.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Right. And now that we have that. Yeah, that's a really</br>   important story to share. Then you had to do two and a half years?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Two and a half years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then you were also, before that, held in an office, detained</br>   for three months?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: About three months, right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then held in a prison for two and a half years?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, then what started as a ten-day holding turned into a long</br>   period of your life. Do you remember any of the conditions or how you were</br>   treated either in the detainment or in the prison?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, they were tents. It was over where it was very common that it</br>   was heard, Maricopa in Arizona. I don't know if you heard.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, in the news?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: On the news on the US. There were tents and then they were made to</br>   wear pink underwear and that's how they were treated there in Maricopa in</br>   Arizona. Well, here, it was tents as well. I know I was a load to my</br>   family's shoulders. I know they had to come over and visit me. They had to</br>   send me money. When my wife was selling all my tools and all my property, I</br>   just told her, &quot;Send me $150.&quot; I bought a lot of ... It's called</br>   commissary, which it's a lot of food, quick soups, beans, Cokes, all that.</br>   I bought tons. And it is common that people that has money, they put a</br>   little store. You sell a Coke and when pay day comes, they give you a Coke</br>   and they give you a soup. For everything that you sell, it is a soup as</br>   interest. So I start building up my store inside and I didn't have to</br>   bother my mom or my sisters, my wife. I was supporting myself over there.</br>   That happened throughout the two years and half. By the time it was three</br>   months before I got out, I start eating all my food with all my friends,</br>   the inmates that I kind of got to know as friends. There were other people</br>   that had stores and they were about to leave about the same time. So we</br>   were eating everything and so we were sharing with all the inmates there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You created your own mini business again inside to support yourself</br>   so your family wouldn't have to. Can you tell me about ... Were your</br>   friends in similar situations, they were undocumented and sent here?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. The people that were there, they were undocumented as well. And</br>   they have a little bit more years to serve than me. There were some of them</br>   that they just that were very few months depending on what they did. There</br>   were people that were just pulled over because they didn't have a</br>   taillight. And it was very, very unbelievable stories that you would hear.</br>   Everybody was there for different reasons.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. This is going to sound like a silly question, but I guess</br>   what I want to discuss is your opinion on how the US government has handled</br>   that and the Mexican government in terms of treating people for crimes that</br>   may not be that serious?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Once you cross the border without any proper documentation, you're up</br>   for anything. You have to be aware. They're not going to give you anything</br>   free. You don't belong there. Bottom line, you don't belong there. If you</br>   work for having a visa, then we're talking about, hey, you have rights</br>   because you went through the whole process. I don't think I'm not logical</br>   person, I think that I can think logically. And I don't agree with those</br>   American people that they live at the border and they take the job as a</br>   security officer and holding people. And they're doing somebody else's job</br>   because they don't want them to come. Let whoever is in charge of doing</br>   their job and mind your own business. No? Now, people that are taking the</br>   risks, they're going to have to pay their consequences sooner or later. But</br>   it is up to them if they want to pay them or how they want to live, how</br>   much they want to risk. Some kids, they cross the border, they don't make</br>   it. And their parents, their siblings, they're crying over on their</br>   hometowns because they didn't made it. But nobody forced them to do that.</br>   There's always risks for everything that you do.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. No, I think that's really fair. A couple of closing</br>   questions, you said both the US and the Mexico has contributed to your</br>   identity and your mentalities. Do you feel Mexican or American?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: On most times, American.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Most times American. Why is that?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: In the US, that's where I create my lifestyle. The point of view is</br>   based of your lifestyle, who you hang out with, why you hang out with them,</br>   what you're capable of doing for some people or some others, not. Over in</br>   the States, I would have a weekend where I would go out, party with my wife</br>   and the next day I will go to a very expensive restaurant and buy her a</br>   bracelet or a necklace, earrings and spend my money with who I love—my</br>   family, my mom, my sisters. I would be very happy being in that restaurant</br>   and everybody around the table and just take care of the tab and not worry</br>   about it. I think that way. In here, in Mexico, even though that is a</br>   little bit harder, I actually do the same thing. I hang out, I go out to</br>   dance, I go to the karaokes. Back then, in the US, I would go to the lake,</br>   do a barbecue. And here, I go to Acapulco. It's a lot better. I don't see</br>   the negative things—I mean, I don't always focus onto the negative things</br>   because negative things will ruin your life. Focus in what you have, who</br>   you are, what you're capable of doing, and what you're capable of helping</br>   others about, with this, with that. If people see you as a valuable person</br>   for the experience you have at this point, they're more than welcome to get</br>   help from myself. But not a lot of people think the same way.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That's true. And you said your wife and children live here</br>   with you, too?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And you work with New Comienzos now?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did your family, did they come back to be with you, then?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: When I was deported, I was at Laredo and I was there for three weeks</br>   until one of my sisters helped my wife pack a trailer. And that was my</br>   house in a trailer, mattress, clothes, shoes, a TV, and the basics. They</br>   drove down to the border and I met them after two years and a half just</br>   about. And we got reunited and we got everything documented just that my</br>   wife got in touch with the authorities at the border and said, &quot;Okay. We're</br>   going to be ... &quot; I don't know how you say, but &quot;self ... &quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: &quot; ... Voluntary departure and we want to pass our property, what is</br>   left out of your house.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. You have to do this and this and</br>   this, put it on a piece of paper in a box what it contains. And in that box</br>   with the number of boxes. Put the number on each box and see what it</br>   contains and everything.&quot; So they did everything by order. We paid the</br>   taxes. We paid whatever they ask us. And as soon as we were driving off the</br>   bridge, we got pulled over by Los Zetas, which is a big old gang in Mexico,</br>   big old rifles and everything. And they wanted to take everything, the</br>   truck—it was a Suburban. They want to take the Suburban and the trailer,</br>   all the property. I told them, &quot;Hey, we're blocking the streets. I'll meet</br>   you over at the hotel where we're staying.&quot; As soon as we got to the hotel,</br>   I ran out to the lobby and I said, &quot;Hey, these guys ... &quot; He's like, &quot;Are</br>   they on white Cherokees?&quot; We're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;They have big old rifles?&quot;</br>   We're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Yeah, they're the Zetas.&quot; &quot;So now what?&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;Oh, you have to give them tons of money.&quot; I was like, &quot;Really?&quot; It was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; By that time, they start pulling over and there were more</br>   people because they can see what it—it was one of those trailers that you</br>   carry mulch because my brother-in-law has a landscaping company. You can</br>   see everything through it. I got there and my brother-in-law, &quot;No, yeah,</br>   yeah, yeah. I'm just the driver. He's the owner of everything, everything.&quot;</br>   Like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Hey ... &quot; I told my brother-in-law, &quot;Hey, do</br>   you have any sheet of papers with English information on it?&quot; He's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah.&quot; So I grabbed that folder and I told the guys, &quot;Hey,</br>   yeah. What can I help you with?&quot; It was like, &quot;Hey, you have to pay taxes</br>   on all your property.&quot; I was like, &quot;We just did. And I'll show the sheet</br>   that I paid all the taxes at the border.&quot; Like, &quot;No, no, no, no. Don't act</br>   stupid. You know what we're talking about.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you paid taxes, too?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: &quot;We are the ones that take care of you going all the way to your</br>   destination safely.&quot; And I said, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; It's like,</br>   &quot;For everything that you carry, at least eight thousand pesos.&quot; Like,</br>   &quot;Really? Okay. I respect what you do. I don't know you. With all due</br>   respect, but I've been deported. It was two years and half that I hadn't</br>   seen my family. This is my wallet.&quot; Open my wallet. I show him. I had like</br>   $350. I said, &quot;This is all I have for gas and meals. We haven't eaten. My</br>   kids are starving. We're about to eat. Is this the way you receive your own</br>   compadres?”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: For sure.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. &quot;That's how you receive us? And you say on big old pamphlets up</br>   on the highways ‘Welcome Paisano. It's vacation time.’ How safe can we feel</br>   having you around? No offense, but I know pretty much you're doing your</br>   job, but are you really doing your job bringing us safe? Being deported and</br>   not have money at all?&quot; And just start looking at me and they start</br>   laughing at each other. And I'm dead serious. &quot;You want my money? This is</br>   all I have. I don't even have enough for gas or going all the way to Mexico</br>   City. This is all I have.&quot; He just give me a big old palm on my shoulder</br>   and it's like, &quot;Just go. Just go.&quot; And like, &quot;Yeah, but I know your tricks.</br>   You're going to let me go, but how about further down? Do you going to give</br>   me a code or something that I went through you or what?&quot; &quot;Oh, just tell</br>   them that the blondie guy just already check you up.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Really?&quot;</br>   He's like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And yeah, we went through, but we didn't found anybody</br>   else. We found the checkpoints with military people around six in the</br>   morning and it was like, &quot;Hey, but you don't want me to unload everything,</br>   right? Just give us a little bit for breakfast.&quot; But if I didn't give</br>   anything to Los Zetas, I'm not going to give you anything because ... And I</br>   told him, &quot;I've been deported. This is my paperwork, and I'm going back</br>   home.&quot; And like, &quot;Just go. Just go.&quot; So we ran with a lot of luck, but we</br>   encountered a lot of dangerous situations that for somehow or another—I</br>   feel like I'm a God believer. I feel like God was leading us and protecting</br>   us and gave the perfect words at the perfect time. And nothing happened.</br>   Nothing bad happened. Yes, I know, but you can see in the news people are</br>   coming, the trucks are disappearing with the people. I didn't want to</br>   imagine the worst-case scenario, but I was always focusing into just speak</br>   the proper words without offending but at the same time being very</br>   straightforward of not willing to do anything that they want me to do.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. It sounds like you were able to think really quickly and</br>   navigate those situations to protect yourself and your family.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: And I'm here. I gave my wife a choice. I said, &quot;You want to stay here</br>   with the kids?&quot; And I told her, I said, &quot;I come over. I come over. I don't</br>   know how I'm going to be able to do it, but I'll come here. I'll keep doing</br>   the business and everything.&quot; But once being there for two years and a</br>   half, you get to know a lot of stories and you realize, hey, this is no</br>   joke. The next time it could be worse. And I was saying to myself, &quot;Hey,</br>   you don't want to lose another two years and a half and not being there for</br>   your daughter, not being there for your son.&quot; I'd rather just enclose</br>   myself and reprimand myself of a lot of ideas that I have and put it in</br>   practice or just do it for my own… I would say, not being selfish. Now I</br>   think about it for my kids. Basically, they're the ones that are stopping</br>   me to do, to a point, crazy stuff for my own advantage or my own better</br>   status economically-wise. Just like, no, I'd rather being together and if</br>   we all eat a sandwich, we're all going to drink a Coke, but always together</br>   because my dad ... That's what happened. My dad would leave us here, would</br>   go over there, and then send for us. And I didn't want to follow the same</br>   pattern. It's just you never know when your kids are going to need you at</br>   one point.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Absolutely. How old are your kids?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: My little princess is thirteen and my boy is sixteen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Thirteen and sixteen. And are they both US citizens, then?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: No. My boy was born here, May 10th, Mother's Day. And Jocelyn, my</br>   little girl, she was born on February 5th.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Here as well?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: No, in the US, in Dallas.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, so your youngest, your daughter—</br> </br> </br>   Dan: She's a US citizen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What are your hopes for them?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, I try to teach them right from wrong in the realistic way, not</br>   just by words, but showing them examples. This is what it could happen. And</br>   my daughter's case, I don't know who's going to be the lucky one, but if</br>   she gets married with somebody from here, he will be American citizen as</br>   soon as they get married. And more likely, they're going to be living in</br>   the States. I really doubt that she will stay here. She doesn't like it.</br>   When we arrived to Mexico, she didn't know a word of Spanish. For that</br>   reason, she's supposed to be enrolled in third grade. They dropped her down</br>   to second grade because she didn't know Spanish. Now, she is number one in</br>   school with the grades and everything. She's very fluent in Spanish. She</br>   flip everything around. I'm really happy for them. I'm really proud of</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's incredible. Yeah. Well, it sounds like they have a great</br>   father to guide them.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: I try.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Is there anything before we close that you'd like to add or let</br>   people know?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="fac4dadd-eb5a-460a-9781-d62150a6672d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Opportunity">Dan: Well, basically, you really have to think more than twice about what<br>
   you want and what you're willing to give up. In some scenarios, you don't<br>
   think with your head. You think with your heart. Your heart, it's not wise<br>
   as your head. Always think about the worst-case scenario. You always think<br>
   about your worst-case scenario, if you're ready for it. And sometimes<br>
   crossing a desert or crossing the river, you end up there. You have to<br>
   think about it. You have to realize what it could be the worst. But always<br>
   be alert for what is coming, but at the same time, know your own limits<br>
   because you can say, &quot;Yeah, yeah. I can do this. I can do this,&quot; but at the<br>
   last minute, you might have not the motivation or you might not have the<br>
   guts to do it. And you put your own limit to yourself. Whatever they do,<br>
   just think twice.<br>

   I bought tons. And it is common that people that has money, they put a<br>
   little store. You sell a Coke and when pay day comes, they give you a Coke<br>
   and they give you a soup. For everything that you sell, it is a soup as<br>
   interest. So I start building up my store inside and I didn't have to<br>
   bother my mom or my sisters, my wife. I was supporting myself over there.<br>
   That happened throughout the two years and half. By the time it was three<br>
   months before I got out, I start eating all my food with all my friends,<br>
   the inmates that I kind of got to know as friends. There were other people<br>
   that had stores and they were about to leave about the same time. So we<br>
   were eating everything and so we were sharing with all the inmates there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: You created your own mini business again inside to support yourself<br>
   so your family wouldn't have to. Can you tell me about ... Were your<br>
   friends in similar situations, they were undocumented and sent here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Dan: Yeah. The people that were there, they were undocumented as well. And<br>
   they have a little bit more years to serve than me. There were some of them<br>
   that they just that were very few months depending on what they did. There<br>
   were people that were just pulled over because they didn't have a<br>
   taillight. And it was very, very unbelievable stories that you would hear.<br>
   Everybody was there for different reasons.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="0243e7d9-f4bf-47f8-a4ea-356ba30813ab" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Lawyer, Detention, Immigration Offenses">Dan: Well, the attorney that I got, he knew that I didn't have documents at<br>
   that moment, so he's just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm going to try to make a<br>
   deal.&quot; He made a deal of—there's a title that you call this, work<br>
   release—that you turn yourself in on the weekends and then you go back to<br>
   work throughout the week. And then you turn back on the weekend and turn<br>
   yourself in. And that's what is supposed to happen, but I don't know how in<br>
   the world they knew I was there and I don't know what time they put the<br>
   hold on me. And then when I got there ... Well, when I tried to get out,<br>
   they told me I couldn't. They said, &quot;But don't worry. If they don't come to<br>
   pick you up, INS, by 8:00 in the morning, we'll let you go.&quot; And I had my<br>
   truck, everything on the parking lot. By, I guess it was 8:01, immigration<br>
   came and then the lady at the reception say, &quot;Hey, you want me to call the<br>
   other guys?” He's like, &quot;No, I just came for that guy.&quot; And yeah, it was a<br>
   little bit rude. I treat them the way he was treating me. He was asking me<br>
   all these sorts of questions. I told him to talk to my attorney. And then<br>
   we got to Dallas, Texas at immigration offices, and I got left there all<br>
   night, basically, until I started yelling and screaming, and they said,<br>
   &quot;Oh! We forgot about you.&quot; They took me to a local jail to stay there<br>
   overnight. And then the next morning, that's when they just told me I was<br>
   going to be able to see an immigration judge. I think I waited for a couple<br>
   of months, three months. I turned myself in May ... it was May the 14th. My<br>
   father passed away May the 21st, and I was not there. Just a bunch of<br>
   things ran through my mind. But when I went to see the judge, they told me,<br>
   &quot;Hey, you were told that they were going to give you five years straight if<br>
   you would come back.&quot; And I served two years and a half. I was two years<br>
   and a half in jail at the border. It was Raymondville by Harlingen. I was<br>
   there working out, building myself up. I had to see the bright side. You<br>
   cannot focus on the negative things or else you get destroyed. I always try<br>
   to joke about sad situations because if I focus into the negative things,<br>
   nothing good comes out of it.<br>
 <br>

   she offered to give me her credit card to go ahead and buy the material.<br>
   When I bought the material, it was more money that we quoted, but I told<br>
   her that it could vary. I gave her all the material. I gave her all the<br>
   receipts, and she was not happy about it. She went over and accused me of<br>
   credit card abuse. I got an attorney and it was like, &quot;Hey, don't worry<br>
   about it. I already got you a deal. It's only going to be 10 days in jail.<br>
   And it's going to be only weekends.&quot; And like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Immigration doesn't<br>
   work on weekends, so I will turn myself in on a Friday night and then I<br>
   will come out on Monday 12:01 in the morning so it will count four days. I<br>
   turned myself in and when I was about to get ready to get out, I called the<br>
   guards and say, &quot;Hey, I need to take a shower because I'm about to go to<br>
   work.&quot; So they let me out. Took my shower, went back to my cell. And then<br>
   about twelve midnight, they called me up and say, &quot;Hey, Cabrero, come<br>
   down.&quot; So I went down. They're like, &quot;Man, I cannot let you out because you<br>
   have an INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] hold.&quot; I'm like,<br>
   &quot;What?&quot; They were like, &quot;Yeah, you have an immigration hold.&quot; &quot;No, not<br>
   really.&quot; That's when I lost my house, I lost my trucks, my trailers, my<br>
   tools, my home, everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: You were living with your family?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Dan: I was already with my wife and my kids at my own property. I was at my<br>
   own house. She had to let everything go. Yeah.<br>

   very perfectionist. Yes, definitely. In here, if you go around the<br>
   buildings anywhere, pick a street, whenever they paint a building, you can<br>
   see a bunch of dripping on the floor on the sidewalks. That's where I make<br>
   the difference in my job. If I do something, I do it better, and people<br>
   like it. And even treat with a person. You say &quot;Hi,&quot; you say, &quot;Good<br>
   afternoon,&quot; &quot;Good morning,&quot; and you get yourself to know by other people as<br>
   an educated, respected person. Not everybody's like this, and I learn it<br>
   from the States. You treat people the way you want to be treated. And<br>
   that's basically where I got my reputation from. You treat everybody the<br>
   way you want to be treated no matter where they're at, no matter who you<br>
   are, no matter who they are. That's my motto.<br>

   with this guy as a helper. He was a contractor for Home Depot putting the<br>
   countertops, taking off the Formica, the wood countertops and putting<br>
   marble or granite. I was doing that with him for about a year, but we were<br>
   looking how other people in that same house were putting hardwood floors,<br>
   painting, and doing this and that. I was gathering their info. It was like,<br>
   &quot;Hey, this is your own business?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Okay. How much do you charge the<br>
   square footage of our engineering wood floors?&quot; &quot;Okay. I'll let you have it<br>
   for $1.50.&quot; So I start getting all that information. And at one point, the<br>
   guy that I was working with, he moved. He bought his own house, but it was<br>
   way too far. So he invited me over and he said, &quot;Hey, I'll pay you rent on<br>
   an apartment nearby, but I need your help.&quot; And I was like, &quot;No.&quot; And at<br>
   that moment, I printed my own business cards and I knew how to paint, so I<br>
   was painting houses. I was painting inside interiors, outside exteriors.<br>
   And I started selling out other people's jobs. For instance, I would say,<br>
   &quot;Hey, I'm looking you're remodeling your house. I can do the engineering<br>
   hardwood floors for $2.50.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, do you have a catalog?&quot; So I<br>
   will run to ... By then, I knew where the hardware stores were, the<br>
   outlets, and they will give me a good rate. If the square footage was<br>
   $1.00, I would resell it for $1.50 or $1.15. And that how I was making out<br>
   my money. I would give somebody else the job, making money out of them, and<br>
   just making money out of the material. That's how I was making money. All<br>
   of a sudden, when I least expected, I was doing electricity, I was doing<br>
   plumbing, I was doing the sprinkler system. I was just doing pretty much<br>
   everything around the house, concrete, shingles, roofing. I was subscribed<br>
   with an insurance company. I believe it was Allstate Farm where all the<br>
   damages would give it to me and they will pay me straight up. I was there.<br>

   I was married already and I had my child. My wife was pregnant with my<br>
   daughter. The violence and the economic situation here was to a point that<br>
   it was not standable no more. My dad came over. He was an American citizen<br>
   by then, and he drove us to the border. And I crossed the border in an<br>
   automobile with my sister and my nephews. And just the officer were like,<br>
   &quot;You American citizen?&quot; &quot;Yes, I am.&quot; &quot;Where were you born?&quot; &quot;Dallas,<br>
   Texas.&quot; And he says, &quot;What hospital?&quot; &quot;Parkland.&quot; And said, &quot;Okay. Go, go,<br>
   go.&quot; They didn't check anything, and that was after 9/11, which the<br>
   security shouldn't be a little tighter? And then my wife came across the<br>

   like, &quot;Why am I going to be showing a visa going to my own country?&quot; That<br>
   was the only reason that I didn't want to go for it. Now I regret it, but I<br>
   just didn't want to do it because, I guess, lack of information, not enough<br>

We were able to qualify to be American</br>   citizens after so long being a permanent resident. And in my mind, it was</br>   like, &quot;Why am I going to be showing a visa going to my own country?&quot; That</br>   was the only reason that I didn't want to go for it.

And time went by and</br>   I regret it now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And so you were mentioning at this time that you didn't have as</br>   much of a fear of authorities because you were a resident. And you said you</br>   didn't want to have a visa for your own country. So you're saying when you</br>   go back to Mexico, you were going to have a visa. You wanted to be a</br>   Mexican citizen—</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: ... and a US resident. But then you said you regret it. Do you mind</br>   going into your last time in the US when you had your company and then when</br>   you were undocumented? Maybe what brought you back to Mexico and then how</br>   you crossed the border for the last time?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, when I crossed the border the last time, that was back in 2009.</br>   I was married already and I had my child. My wife was pregnant with my</br>   daughter. The violence and the economic situation here was to a point that</br>   it was not standable no more. My dad came over.

We didn't have the</br>   necessity of walking down the mountain or going through ... risk our lives</br>   like other people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Would you recommend migrating even now when there is the</br>   possibility of risking of your life and more dangerous paths? Or do you</br>   think it's only worth migrating if you can do it safely?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: It's worth migrating if you can do it safely because your life is not</br>   worth it. Walking through the night and long distance, I haven't</br>   experienced it, but I have friends that they told me that they encounter</br>   wild pigs and snakes and they're not here anymore. Just try to go ahead and</br>   have a better life. In here, in Mexico, my advantage is that I speak</br>   English. No matter how old I am, I still have a few doors open. I struggle,</br>   but I can manage, and I can survive. I can go by. But all those people that</br>   they really need to have a better life, whatever they're going to spend on</br>   crossing the border, risking their lives, they should invest that money</br>   into their education and then they have a better option of having a better</br>   job and make themselves worth that they really want to be worth.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. I think that's important because it can be a really dangerous</br>   journey it is what stories seem to say. When you got to the US for the last</br>   time, you went through car and didn't have any issues. How did you start</br>   running your own company? Do you mind telling me a bit about that?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Sure. Obviously, back then I didn't have no documents. I start working</br>   with this guy as a helper.

And at one point, the</br>   guy that I was working with, he moved. He bought his own house, but it was</br>   way too far. So he invited me over and he said, &quot;Hey, I'll pay you rent on</br>   an apartment nearby, but I need your help.&quot; And I was like, &quot;No.&quot; And at</br>   that moment, I printed my own business cards and I knew how to paint, so I</br>   was painting houses. I was painting inside interiors, outside exteriors.</br>   And I started selling out other people's jobs. For instance, I would say,</br>   &quot;Hey, I'm looking you're remodeling your house. I can do the engineering</br>   hardwood floors for $2.50.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, do you have a catalog?&quot; So I</br>   will run to ... By then, I knew where the hardware stores were, the</br>   outlets, and they will give me a good rate. If the square footage was</br>   $1.00, I would resell it for $1.50 or $1.15. And that how I was making out</br>   my money. I would give somebody else the job, making money out of them, and</br>   just making money out of the material. That's how I was making money. All</br>   of a sudden, when I least expected, I was doing electricity, I was doing</br>   plumbing, I was doing the sprinkler system. I was just doing pretty much</br>   everything around the house, concrete, shingles, roofing. I was subscribed</br>   with an insurance company. I believe it was Allstate Farm where all the</br>   damages would give it to me and they will pay me straight up. I was there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow. That was just being so resourceful and connected with people,</br>   putting it together kind of like the American hustle.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Definitely. Yes. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, that's really cool. Going off of that, one thing we're</br>   focusing on in the interviews is talking about how you may have been shaped</br>   by the US and by Mexico. Do you think that any values or behavior or</br>   mindsets in America shaped who you are or what you have accomplished or</br>   done?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yes. I'm very organized. Obviously, that came from my parents. I'm</br>   very perfectionist. Yes, definitely. In here, if you go around the</br>   buildings anywhere, pick a street, whenever they paint a building, you can</br>   see a bunch of dripping on the floor on the sidewalks. That's where I make</br>   the difference in my job. If I do something, I do it better, and people</br>   like it. And even treat with a person. You say &quot;Hi,&quot; you say, &quot;Good</br>   afternoon,&quot; &quot;Good morning,&quot; and you get yourself to know by other people as</br>   an educated, respected person. Not everybody's like this, and I learn it</br>   from the States. You treat people the way you want to be treated. And</br>   that's basically where I got my reputation from. You treat everybody the</br>   way you want to be treated no matter where they're at, no matter who you</br>   are, no matter who they are. That's my motto.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I think that's incredible and I think it shows in the company you</br>   were able to make. Could you tell me, then, you were using these values,</br>   you were creating a company, you were creating jobs for other people in the</br>   US, and then you were deported and had this experience with law</br>   enforcement. Can you describe that for me?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yes. It was this lady where I went over and gave her an estimate. And</br>   she offered to give me her credit card to go ahead and buy the material.</br>   When I bought the material, it was more money that we quoted, but I told</br>   her that it could vary. I gave her all the material. I gave her all the</br>   receipts, and she was not happy about it. She went over and accused me of</br>   credit card abuse. I got an attorney and it was like, &quot;Hey, don't worry</br>   about it. I already got you a deal. It's only going to be 10 days in jail.</br>   And it's going to be only weekends.&quot; And like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Immigration doesn't</br>   work on weekends, so I will turn myself in on a Friday night and then I</br>   will come out on Monday 12:01 in the morning so it will count four days. I</br>   turned myself in and when I was about to get ready to get out, I called the</br>   guards and say, &quot;Hey, I need to take a shower because I'm about to go to</br>   work.&quot; So they let me out. Took my shower, went back to my cell. And then</br>   about twelve midnight, they called me up and say, &quot;Hey, Cabrero, come</br>   down.&quot; So I went down. They're like, &quot;Man, I cannot let you out because you</br>   have an INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] hold.&quot; I'm like,</br>   &quot;What?&quot; They were like, &quot;Yeah, you have an immigration hold.&quot; &quot;No, not</br>   really.&quot; That's when I lost my house, I lost my trucks, my trailers, my</br>   tools, my home, everything.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You were living with your family?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: I was already with my wife and my kids at my own property. I was at my</br>   own house. She had to let everything go. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm curious, you were doing time in jail for this credit card</br>   infraction that this woman accused you of on the weekends. Is that</br>   something that normally happens?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, the attorney that I got, he knew that I didn't have documents at</br>   that moment, so he's just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm going to try to make a</br>   deal.&quot; He made a deal of—there's a title that you call this, work</br>   release—that you turn yourself in on the weekends and then you go back to</br>   work throughout the week. And then you turn back on the weekend and turn</br>   yourself in. And that's what is supposed to happen, but I don't know how in</br>   the world they knew I was there and I don't know what time they put the</br>   hold on me. And then when I got there ... Well, when I tried to get out,</br>   they told me I couldn't. They said, &quot;But don't worry. If they don't come to</br>   pick you up, INS, by 8:00 in the morning, we'll let you go.&quot; And I had my</br>   truck, everything on the parking lot. By, I guess it was 8:01, immigration</br>   came and then the lady at the reception say, &quot;Hey, you want me to call the</br>   other guys?” He's like, &quot;No, I just came for that guy.&quot; And yeah, it was a</br>   little bit rude. I treat them the way he was treating me. He was asking me</br>   all these sorts of questions. I told him to talk to my attorney. And then</br>   we got to Dallas, Texas at immigration offices, and I got left there all</br>   night, basically, until I started yelling and screaming, and they said,</br>   &quot;Oh! We forgot about you.&quot; They took me to a local jail to stay there</br>   overnight. And then the next morning, that's when they just told me I was</br>   going to be able to see an immigration judge. I think I waited for a couple</br>   of months, three months. I turned myself in May ... it was May the 14th. My</br>   father passed away May the 21st, and I was not there. Just a bunch of</br>   things ran through my mind. But when I went to see the judge, they told me,</br>   &quot;Hey, you were told that they were going to give you five years straight if</br>   you would come back.&quot; And I served two years and a half. I was two years</br>   and a half in jail at the border. It was Raymondville by Harlingen. I was</br>   there working out, building myself up. I had to see the bright side. You</br>   cannot focus on the negative things or else you get destroyed. I always try</br>   to joke about sad situations because if I focus into the negative things,</br>   nothing good comes out of it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. No. That is a really ... Honestly, I can only imagine a</br>   really difficult time. You thought you were going in for a small ten days</br>   in jail—you're going to keep on working, still have your job, your house,</br>   your family. And the next thing you know, everything's being ripped from</br>   you. And that's honestly ... Thank you for sharing. That's a really</br>   difficult thing to rehash. That is one of the stories we're trying to tell</br>   is great people who are contributing to the US economy who are acting as</br>   full citizens, doing everything right like you were, and doing everything</br>   ... You know what I mean? Living a great American lifestyle.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: I still have my tax returns, everything. I was about to burn them up a</br>   couple of days ago because I found them. And I was like, I don't know if I</br>   should burn them down or what. And it was like, &quot;Eh, I'm just going to keep</br>   them.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Doing that and having that perfectionist tendency.</br>   Everything's perfectly done. And then serving time, doing what you were</br>   supposed to do, serving time for the crime, for whatever this person</br>   accused you of. And then because of your undocumented status, that becoming</br>   ... pretty much serving time for a crime you didn't commit is kind of like</br>   how we were seeing it. Taking someone who is in no way a criminal and then</br>   treating them as such.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. Because it was her word against mine when I said, &quot;Hey, she gave</br>   me an authorization to purchase all the material.&quot; And then showing the</br>   judge a sheet of paper that I quoted her how much would it be plus the</br>   material and that not being enough proof that she authorized it. They</br>   showed the videos at Home Depot where I was buying the material and I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, I didn't buy nothing for myself. Everything is for you. This is</br>   the receipts. How many items are in the receipts? This is how many items</br>   are in your house.&quot; I didn't charge nothing more, nothing less, and I told</br>   you, &quot;I have no control over the prices. If you went over the…,&quot; I would</br>   say, &quot;the quoted price verbally, reality was another, but I had no control</br>   over that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. And I feel like that also is fairly common when buying</br>   material for a house. There's the budget and then there's what it actually</br>   ends up being. Then that's not in your control.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That sounds ... I wonder, do you think she knew of your</br>   undocumented status? Do you think she knew what this would mean?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: She found out because my mom, my sisters went to talk to her.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: They told her and said, &quot;Hey, he didn't do nothing wrong and you're</br>   accusing him of something that he didn't commit. How much do you want to</br>   just take off the charges, just say that it was a miscommunication?&quot; And my</br>   mom told her that consequences of what could happen and she didn't care.</br>   She proceeded.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Who has that kind of hate in their heart? I don't know. That's just</br>   feels really selfish on her part.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right. I don't know what she was going through. I don't know what she</br>   thought, but I was very clear. And then I tried to tell her, &quot;If you don't</br>   want the job, I can return the items. I have the receipts and they can put</br>   back on your credit card. It will be no problem.&quot; And when I saw that she</br>   was really going through it, I told her, I said, &quot;You know what? I can pay</br>   you some money for wasting your time, for the hustle, and just to be there</br>   at the wrong time, at the wrong moment if you want to call it that way.&quot;</br>   And she said, &quot;No, I don't want anything out of you.&quot; I don't know. But at</br>   that moment, that's when my mom and my sisters went and talked to her. They</br>   went and talked to her even though the attorney told her not to get in</br>   touch with her. It can be misconception, a misunderstanding, but they went</br>   over and did it anyway. But she didn't want to budge out.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It sounds like when you presented your case, there was video</br>   evidence, you had all the receipts. Do you think that there was any bias?</br>   Do you think there was any discrimination because of your identity?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: She was Hispanic as well.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: She was Hispanic as well?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. Well, she was half American, half Hispanic. She didn't know how</br>   to speak Spanish, but I believe her last name was Hispanic. But I just</br>   don't know. I cannot say anything on her behalf.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Or the judge's.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right. But the only thing I can say was what it went through my mind,</br>   what I went through, what I did, what I tried to do.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Right. And now that we have that. Yeah, that's a really</br>   important story to share. Then you had to do two and a half years?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Two and a half years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then you were also, before that, held in an office, detained</br>   for three months?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: About three months, right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then held in a prison for two and a half years?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, then what started as a ten-day holding turned into a long</br>   period of your life. Do you remember any of the conditions or how you were</br>   treated either in the detainment or in the prison?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, they were tents. It was over where it was very common that it</br>   was heard, Maricopa in Arizona. I don't know if you heard.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, in the news?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: On the news on the US. There were tents and then they were made to</br>   wear pink underwear and that's how they were treated there in Maricopa in</br>   Arizona. Well, here, it was tents as well. I know I was a load to my</br>   family's shoulders. I know they had to come over and visit me. They had to</br>   send me money. When my wife was selling all my tools and all my property, I</br>   just told her, &quot;Send me $150.&quot; I bought a lot of ... It's called</br>   commissary, which it's a lot of food, quick soups, beans, Cokes, all that.</br>   I bought tons. And it is common that people that has money, they put a</br>   little store. You sell a Coke and when pay day comes, they give you a Coke</br>   and they give you a soup. For everything that you sell, it is a soup as</br>   interest. So I start building up my store inside and I didn't have to</br>   bother my mom or my sisters, my wife. I was supporting myself over there.</br>   That happened throughout the two years and half. By the time it was three</br>   months before I got out, I start eating all my food with all my friends,</br>   the inmates that I kind of got to know as friends. There were other people</br>   that had stores and they were about to leave about the same time. So we</br>   were eating everything and so we were sharing with all the inmates there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You created your own mini business again inside to support yourself</br>   so your family wouldn't have to. Can you tell me about ... Were your</br>   friends in similar situations, they were undocumented and sent here?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. The people that were there, they were undocumented as well. And</br>   they have a little bit more years to serve than me. There were some of them</br>   that they just that were very few months depending on what they did. There</br>   were people that were just pulled over because they didn't have a</br>   taillight. And it was very, very unbelievable stories that you would hear.</br>   Everybody was there for different reasons.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. This is going to sound like a silly question, but I guess</br>   what I want to discuss is your opinion on how the US government has handled</br>   that and the Mexican government in terms of treating people for crimes that</br>   may not be that serious?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Once you cross the border without any proper documentation, you're up</br>   for anything. You have to be aware. They're not going to give you anything</br>   free. You don't belong there. Bottom line, you don't belong there. If you</br>   work for having a visa, then we're talking about, hey, you have rights</br>   because you went through the whole process. I don't think I'm not logical</br>   person, I think that I can think logically. And I don't agree with those</br>   American people that they live at the border and they take the job as a</br>   security officer and holding people. And they're doing somebody else's job</br>   because they don't want them to come. Let whoever is in charge of doing</br>   their job and mind your own business. No? Now, people that are taking the</br>   risks, they're going to have to pay their consequences sooner or later. But</br>   it is up to them if they want to pay them or how they want to live, how</br>   much they want to risk. Some kids, they cross the border, they don't make</br>   it. And their parents, their siblings, they're crying over on their</br>   hometowns because they didn't made it. But nobody forced them to do that.</br>   There's always risks for everything that you do.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. No, I think that's really fair. A couple of closing</br>   questions, you said both the US and the Mexico has contributed to your</br>   identity and your mentalities. Do you feel Mexican or American?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: On most times, American.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Most times American. Why is that?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: In the US, that's where I create my lifestyle. The point of view is</br>   based of your lifestyle, who you hang out with, why you hang out with them,</br>   what you're capable of doing for some people or some others, not. Over in</br>   the States, I would have a weekend where I would go out, party with my wife</br>   and the next day I will go to a very expensive restaurant and buy her a</br>   bracelet or a necklace, earrings and spend my money with who I love—my</br>   family, my mom, my sisters. I would be very happy being in that restaurant</br>   and everybody around the table and just take care of the tab and not worry</br>   about it. I think that way. In here, in Mexico, even though that is a</br>   little bit harder, I actually do the same thing. I hang out, I go out to</br>   dance, I go to the karaokes. Back then, in the US, I would go to the lake,</br>   do a barbecue. And here, I go to Acapulco. It's a lot better. I don't see</br>   the negative things—I mean, I don't always focus onto the negative things</br>   because negative things will ruin your life. Focus in what you have, who</br>   you are, what you're capable of doing, and what you're capable of helping</br>   others about, with this, with that. If people see you as a valuable person</br>   for the experience you have at this point, they're more than welcome to get</br>   help from myself. But not a lot of people think the same way.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. That's true. And you said your wife and children live here</br>   with you, too?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And you work with New Comienzos now?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did your family, did they come back to be with you, then?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: When I was deported, I was at Laredo and I was there for three weeks</br>   until one of my sisters helped my wife pack a trailer. And that was my</br>   house in a trailer, mattress, clothes, shoes, a TV, and the basics. They</br>   drove down to the border and I met them after two years and a half just</br>   about. And we got reunited and we got everything documented just that my</br>   wife got in touch with the authorities at the border and said, &quot;Okay. We're</br>   going to be ... &quot; I don't know how you say, but &quot;self ... &quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: &quot; ... Voluntary departure and we want to pass our property, what is</br>   left out of your house.&quot; It's like, &quot;Okay. You have to do this and this and</br>   this, put it on a piece of paper in a box what it contains. And in that box</br>   with the number of boxes. Put the number on each box and see what it</br>   contains and everything.&quot; So they did everything by order. We paid the</br>   taxes. We paid whatever they ask us. And as soon as we were driving off the</br>   bridge, we got pulled over by Los Zetas, which is a big old gang in Mexico,</br>   big old rifles and everything. And they wanted to take everything, the</br>   truck—it was a Suburban. They want to take the Suburban and the trailer,</br>   all the property. I told them, &quot;Hey, we're blocking the streets. I'll meet</br>   you over at the hotel where we're staying.&quot; As soon as we got to the hotel,</br>   I ran out to the lobby and I said, &quot;Hey, these guys ... &quot; He's like, &quot;Are</br>   they on white Cherokees?&quot; We're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;They have big old rifles?&quot;</br>   We're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Yeah, they're the Zetas.&quot; &quot;So now what?&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;Oh, you have to give them tons of money.&quot; I was like, &quot;Really?&quot; It was</br>   like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; By that time, they start pulling over and there were more</br>   people because they can see what it—it was one of those trailers that you</br>   carry mulch because my brother-in-law has a landscaping company. You can</br>   see everything through it. I got there and my brother-in-law, &quot;No, yeah,</br>   yeah, yeah. I'm just the driver. He's the owner of everything, everything.&quot;</br>   Like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Hey ... &quot; I told my brother-in-law, &quot;Hey, do</br>   you have any sheet of papers with English information on it?&quot; He's like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah.&quot; So I grabbed that folder and I told the guys, &quot;Hey,</br>   yeah. What can I help you with?&quot; It was like, &quot;Hey, you have to pay taxes</br>   on all your property.&quot; I was like, &quot;We just did. And I'll show the sheet</br>   that I paid all the taxes at the border.&quot; Like, &quot;No, no, no, no. Don't act</br>   stupid. You know what we're talking about.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you paid taxes, too?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: &quot;We are the ones that take care of you going all the way to your</br>   destination safely.&quot; And I said, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; It's like,</br>   &quot;For everything that you carry, at least eight thousand pesos.&quot; Like,</br>   &quot;Really? Okay. I respect what you do. I don't know you. With all due</br>   respect, but I've been deported. It was two years and half that I hadn't</br>   seen my family. This is my wallet.&quot; Open my wallet. I show him. I had like</br>   $350. I said, &quot;This is all I have for gas and meals. We haven't eaten. My</br>   kids are starving. We're about to eat. Is this the way you receive your own</br>   compadres?”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: For sure.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Yeah. &quot;That's how you receive us? And you say on big old pamphlets up</br>   on the highways ‘Welcome Paisano. It's vacation time.’ How safe can we feel</br>   having you around? No offense, but I know pretty much you're doing your</br>   job, but are you really doing your job bringing us safe? Being deported and</br>   not have money at all?&quot; And just start looking at me and they start</br>   laughing at each other. And I'm dead serious. &quot;You want my money? This is</br>   all I have. I don't even have enough for gas or going all the way to Mexico</br>   City. This is all I have.&quot; He just give me a big old palm on my shoulder</br>   and it's like, &quot;Just go. Just go.&quot; And like, &quot;Yeah, but I know your tricks.</br>   You're going to let me go, but how about further down? Do you going to give</br>   me a code or something that I went through you or what?&quot; &quot;Oh, just tell</br>   them that the blondie guy just already check you up.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Really?&quot;</br>   He's like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And yeah, we went through, but we didn't found anybody</br>   else. We found the checkpoints with military people around six in the</br>   morning and it was like, &quot;Hey, but you don't want me to unload everything,</br>   right? Just give us a little bit for breakfast.&quot; But if I didn't give</br>   anything to Los Zetas, I'm not going to give you anything because ... And I</br>   told him, &quot;I've been deported. This is my paperwork, and I'm going back</br>   home.&quot; And like, &quot;Just go. Just go.&quot; So we ran with a lot of luck, but we</br>   encountered a lot of dangerous situations that for somehow or another—I</br>   feel like I'm a God believer. I feel like God was leading us and protecting</br>   us and gave the perfect words at the perfect time. And nothing happened.</br>   Nothing bad happened. Yes, I know, but you can see in the news people are</br>   coming, the trucks are disappearing with the people. I didn't want to</br>   imagine the worst-case scenario, but I was always focusing into just speak</br>   the proper words without offending but at the same time being very</br>   straightforward of not willing to do anything that they want me to do.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. It sounds like you were able to think really quickly and</br>   navigate those situations to protect yourself and your family.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: And I'm here. I gave my wife a choice. I said, &quot;You want to stay here</br>   with the kids?&quot; And I told her, I said, &quot;I come over. I come over. I don't</br>   know how I'm going to be able to do it, but I'll come here. I'll keep doing</br>   the business and everything.&quot; But once being there for two years and a</br>   half, you get to know a lot of stories and you realize, hey, this is no</br>   joke. The next time it could be worse. And I was saying to myself, &quot;Hey,</br>   you don't want to lose another two years and a half and not being there for</br>   your daughter, not being there for your son.&quot; I'd rather just enclose</br>   myself and reprimand myself of a lot of ideas that I have and put it in</br>   practice or just do it for my own… I would say, not being selfish. Now I</br>   think about it for my kids. Basically, they're the ones that are stopping</br>   me to do, to a point, crazy stuff for my own advantage or my own better</br>   status economically-wise. Just like, no, I'd rather being together and if</br>   we all eat a sandwich, we're all going to drink a Coke, but always together</br>   because my dad ... That's what happened. My dad would leave us here, would</br>   go over there, and then send for us. And I didn't want to follow the same</br>   pattern. It's just you never know when your kids are going to need you at</br>   one point.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Absolutely. How old are your kids?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: My little princess is thirteen and my boy is sixteen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Thirteen and sixteen. And are they both US citizens, then?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: No. My boy was born here, May 10th, Mother's Day. And Jocelyn, my</br>   little girl, she was born on February 5th.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Here as well?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: No, in the US, in Dallas.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, so your youngest, your daughter—</br> </br> </br>   Dan: She's a US citizen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What are your hopes for them?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, I try to teach them right from wrong in the realistic way, not</br>   just by words, but showing them examples. This is what it could happen. And</br>   my daughter's case, I don't know who's going to be the lucky one, but if</br>   she gets married with somebody from here, he will be American citizen as</br>   soon as they get married. And more likely, they're going to be living in</br>   the States. I really doubt that she will stay here. She doesn't like it.</br>   When we arrived to Mexico, she didn't know a word of Spanish. For that</br>   reason, she's supposed to be enrolled in third grade. They dropped her down</br>   to second grade because she didn't know Spanish. Now, she is number one in</br>   school with the grades and everything. She's very fluent in Spanish. She</br>   flip everything around. I'm really happy for them. I'm really proud of</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's incredible. Yeah. Well, it sounds like they have a great</br>   father to guide them.</br> </br> </br>   Dan: I try.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Is there anything before we close that you'd like to add or let</br>   people know?</br> </br> </br>   Dan: Well, basically, you really have to think more than twice about what</br>   you want and what you're willing to give up. In some scenarios, you don't</br>   think with your head. You think with your heart. Your heart, it's not wise</br>   as your head. Always think about the worst-case scenario. You always think</br>   about your worst-case scenario, if you're ready for it. And sometimes</br>   crossing a desert or crossing the river, you end up there. You have to</br>   think about it. You have to realize what it could be the worst. But always</br>   be alert for what is coming, but at the same time, know your own limits</br>   because you can say, &quot;Yeah, yeah. I can do this. I can do this,&quot; but at the</br>   last minute, you might have not the motivation or you might not have the</br>   guts to do it. And you put your own limit to yourself. Whatever they do,</br>   just think twice.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I think that's perfectly said. I think we can end on that.</br> </div><\p></p>
