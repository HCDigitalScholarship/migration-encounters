     poin</span>t. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,</br>     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all</br>     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small</br>     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that</br>     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try</br>     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff</br>     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down</br>     to eat. That's when I was like, &quot;Okay, what am I doing here? They're making</br>     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.&quot;</br>     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're</br>     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is</br>     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two</br>     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back</br>     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general</br>     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I</br>     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the</br>     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or</br>     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]</br>     again. You go back to [_____], you go back to start at where you started</br>     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a</br>     regular agent. I mean I don't have any problems, such as if I become a</br>     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much</br>     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's</br>     the way I see it. After that, you hit the wall. You don't actually get to</br>     move forward.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I'm pretty sure the call centers are doing their best to help us out, but I</br>     don't know. It is very difficult. You're actually waiting to see what's</br>     going to happen. Every time you go to a call center, you wait to see what's</br>     going to happen next. Okay, I'm here right now. This is a good account. I'm</br>     getting my money, but what if it moves? For us it's difficult because, as</br>     being in this business, I think it is a business, I got to invest my time</br>     and I’ve got to save money because I don't know what's going to happen</br>     next. That's why I've been in so many call centers here.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You told me you've been to a lot of centers.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I've been to a lot of call centers, a lot. Tell me about it, you can ask me</br>     about the call centers, the things I’ve done, the accounts. I've been to a</br>     MasterCard, Kohls, I've even sold packages for cable TV, all those things.</br>     You get to learn too. That's one of the advantages because you're learning</br>     too, because you're managing money, people's money, you actually get to</br>     know. I mean, on my end, that's what I've learned. I don't talk bad about</br>     the call centers. I learned a lot. I never, well, in the States I never had</br>     a credit card due to the fact that I was an illegal immigrant. But here I</br>     have been managing people's credit cards, and it's like, &quot;Oh, I didn't know</br>     about this.&quot; I mean, right now I'm in a call center where you lease phones.</br>     I was surprised about leasing phones. I never heard about leasing phones. I</br>     heard about leasing TVs, leasing cars, but phones?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right now, I'm leasing the phones and have to explain to them that they're</br>     not financing the phones. I learned other stuff, like when you finance, and</br>     you rent is a completely different thing. You’re learning a lot. you really</br>     get to learn a lot about call centers.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     When you call up these call centers or customer service and you end up at a</br>     call center, people know so much. With all this movement, how do you master</br>     everything you need to know to be able to offer that service?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay, well actually, at every call center... It's amazing when you go in</br>     and apply at a different call center. Because the first time I got to a</br>     call center, it was difficult for me when the company moved. For me, moving</br>     to another one is like, &quot;What am I going to do? I just know how to manage</br>     this system.&quot; But it’s amazing that most of the call centers have a similar</br>     system. They manage a similar system. I mean they all go and manage this</br>     system called Abaya, which is the one that you get to answer the phones.</br>     Most companies have the Abaya. I really don't know why, but all of them are</br>     similar. Okay?</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     After that, most of the steps that you follow are the same. Even though</br>     they're different products, the steps are very similar. You don't get</br>     really trapped in like what am I going to do next? No, it's very similar</br>     and they actually give you a very good training and you get to know, “I</br>     used to do this at this call center.” I used to manage, for example,</br>     setting up a credit card to make a payment. Most of the systems are the</br>     same. It's like, okay, I know how to do this. Most of the accounts you get</br>     the personal information about the customer, so you have to get the</br>     customer's information. You know that you have to set it up on tabs and all</br>     the squares but it's very similar.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But dealing with Kohls, are we talking about the clothing? Dealing with</br>     customers calling about Kohls and dealing with customers calling about</br>     leasing a phone is a completely different product.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. Different products, same process.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How do you learn about the product? Don't you have to know about the</br>     product?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes, they teach you about each product and how it works. The similar thing</br>     is at every call center you must ask for personal information. After that</br>     then it goes to product, which is not difficult. It's just the process that</br>     – in this case, for example, Kohls, clothing product. They teach you. You</br>     don't have to learn about each and every clothing. No, it's numbers. All of</br>     the clothes go by certain numbers that you'd have to click in. It's called</br>     S-K-Us, right? Here in the phone industry, we manage the phones, but it's</br>     the same at Kohls because you're not managing clothing, but you manage a</br>     number. Okay? You click on the number and the basic number pulls out the</br>     brand of the phone. I know on our end Samsung Galaxy or an iPhone is called</br>     iPhone or Samsung, but in this industry it's a number. That's why you don't</br>     really get to move like, okay, I need to learn woman's miniskirts or a</br>     woman's bra or a bunch of phones. Like, &quot;What am I going to do?&quot; I mean</br>     it's been a long time. “Nokia? Somebody is asking me for a Nokia? They're</br>     gone.” But yes, you just put on the number and it's amazing. “Nokia It's</br>     been a long time since I've seen you. I had you once, and you fell down,</br>     but you never die.”</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Is it boring?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Sometimes it is. It is something that is very routine. It's a routine.</br>     Especially when you're back-to-back, when you have one call after another,</br>     then it is boring. Even the call centers try to help you out with certain</br>     days, like, &quot;Okay, we'll take you out for, I don't know, a little</br>     breakfast.&quot; Still, you're going back to the call. It is boring sometimes.</br>     It's very stressful. Managing people, customer service, face to face or on</br>     the phone, is difficult. Dealing with people is, I'm not going to say the</br>     worst because we have to deal with people, but it is very, very difficult.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You're dealing with angry people.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I deal with very angry people. Yes. I have to breathe. I put myself on a</br>     little mute. I listen to everything they got to say. Sometimes they tell</br>     me, I mean what customers tell me is like, &quot;I'm not angry about you, I'm</br>     angry about the product. I'm angry about the company.&quot; But I have to take</br>     it because I'm still the company, right? At the end, you're the company and</br>     you work for this company. You’ve got to talk good about the company that</br>     you work for everywhere you go. You have to go back and say, &quot;Yes ma'am,</br>     let's go ahead and verify what the issue is, and I'd be more than glad to</br>     help you out with whatever. Let me exhaust my help. Let me see the most I</br>     can do for you. Even if I have to talk to my supervisor and you need to</br>     talk to him, but it has to be fixed.&quot; That's how it is.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You also told me yesterday about the ways in which you have this kind of</br>     network of people who all moved, spread news.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. At a call center you turn out to be friends with everybody. For</br>     example, I left a lot of friends at some other call centers. If I move on</br>     for better pay, we just move to another call center and verify if they</br>     actually pay good. I have friends that we manage to, we actually call each</br>     other, &quot;You know what? I'm here at this call center. They're paying, I</br>     don't know, 3,500 3,200 why don't you come over?&quot; That’s like, &quot;Okay wait,</br>     but don't come yet. Let me just get my first paycheck, and I'll let you</br>     know if it's true.&quot; So it’s like, &quot;Okay, let me know.&quot; I have to wait. I’ve</br>     even waited 15 days or if he just got in, for example, on the 5th of a</br>     specific month, I have to wait because they don't get paid exactly on the</br>     15th. They would probably get paid on the 31st, and I’d have to wait a</br>     whole month waiting for him to show me his paycheck.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;You know what? Yes, it is true. They're paying this much.&quot; Then I have to</br>     go, &quot;Hey sir, I've got to go.&quot; &quot;Why are you going? Why are you leaving?&quot;</br>     &quot;Well, I found a better place.&quot; Most likely they don't retain you, they</br>     don't try to keep you because this is a very rotating place. You rotate</br>     time to time. That's how we communicate through this networking as you call</br>     it. &quot;I'm here, I'm at TeleTech, come here, there's a brand-new account and</br>     they're going to be paying good.&quot; That's how we travel around.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Let's say you’re in TeleTech or you're in one place and some place opens</br>     and it's a new account that pays better. What happens to the old account?</br>     Everybody leaves and then what?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Most likely everybody leaves. It's like somebody is crying wolf. &quot;Let's</br>     go,&quot; and eventually they all leave. I mean they say, &quot;I'm sorry&quot; but I</br>     don't know what exactly happens. I've seen companies that, for example,</br>     there was a brand-new place, an AT&amp;amp;T. As soon as they opened, everybody</br>     took off. The call center got empty.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     The other call center?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     The other call center was empty. They started setting up advertisements</br>     everywhere. &quot;Hey, we need people, we need people.&quot; But that's how it is.</br>     That's basically what we want is really, we're trying to get a place with</br>     stability and a good pay.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Do the other call centers raise their pay?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Not the call center, there are accounts that pay good.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But the ones that lose when everybody runs off to AT&amp;amp;T and leaves their</br>     other jobs. Do the other call centers sometimes increase their pay to</br>     retain?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No. No. I guess we talk about it. You asked me about what happens to the</br>     new immigrants that come here. They're the ones that come on to take our</br>     place because they don't know what's going on. They just, &quot;Oh, a call</br>     center. I'm going to get 2000 pesos, I don't know, every two weeks.&quot; It's</br>     good because they are new immigrants. Even if we know about it, and they</br>     become our friends for a little while before we move on to the other call</br>     center. We let them know, &quot;You know what? Why don't you come with us?&quot; But</br>     they're afraid. &quot;No, I need to get experience.&quot; As soon as they get</br>     experience, &quot;What was I thinking? What happened in my head that I was stuck</br>     right here?&quot; That's what they do, and then they call us up. &quot;Hey, do you</br>     think they're still hiring?&quot; &quot;Yes. Come over.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Roughly what percentage of the people in the call centers lived in the</br>     States, and what percentage are Mexican would you say?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay, I will tell you in my head that 25% are from Mexico, 75% are</br>     immigrants. People nowadays, from here, start learning English. It is</br>     becoming very popular to learn English. I've seen people from here that</br>     don't need to work. They actually just try to improve their English, and</br>     they get into a call center.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     As a way of improving their English?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Exactly. Not to get money. Well, they actually are taking advantage of it</br>     because they're getting money, and they're learning English. That's the</br>     25%. Some of them, because they're in school, they learned it maybe by</br>     playing games. When we're in training and we have to actually introduce</br>     ourselves, I'm amazed that they learned English playing games online or by</br>     watching movies. I was like, it took me a lot in the States to learn</br>     English because I was just listening to English. But it took me a little</br>     while and they're just like, &quot;Oh I learned it by watching, I don't know,</br>     Finding Nemo and Toy Story.” I'm laughing at all of it, &quot;Yeah you did.</br>     Yes.&quot; We've had this guy introducing himself, he actually knew the Toy</br>     Story song and I was like, &quot;Yes, you did learn English with Toy Story.&quot;</br>     That's the 25%. Some of them, they do need it because they're actually in</br>     school here, they study they're actually just trying to keep on learning</br>     and move on.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What's the relationship between the two groups? Is there like a solidarity</br>     between the returning immigrants and then the Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     We're together. We're actually together. We become very good friends</br>     because this is what happens when they learn English, they get to learn the</br>     culture. They get to learn the American culture by all these games, by</br>     watching the movies. We can have a conversation. If someone here does not</br>     have the same ideas, we don't actually have this problem. Some of them ask</br>     us, &quot;Hey, you've been in the States, how is this? How is that? You've been</br>     to Disneyland?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Mickey mouse is big?&quot; But that's simple stuff. They</br>     don't ask much. I'll give you another example. I had a friend that didn't</br>     know, &quot;Hey, what is a money order?&quot; &quot;That's like a voucher. We don't have</br>     these here.&quot; “Oh, that's a money order.”</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     A money order?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     A money order. Yes. &quot;I don't know what's a money order.&quot; &quot;Okay. That's a</br>     voucher. You go to the liquor store, you go to the store, you ask for</br>     certain amount and then they put some numbers, and that's money.&quot; &quot;Really?</br>     How come we don't have this here?&quot; &quot;Here I don't think that’s going to be a</br>     good idea.&quot; They don't know those things because they've never been there.</br>     But that's certain little things.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     That's really interesting because a lot of other people talk about the</br>     discrimination that they face here for speaking English.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     It looks like things are a little different in a call center. It's like an</br>     oasis maybe.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. Because they get involved with us. They want to know. They are a</br>     very curious people that already learned or are trying to learn the</br>     language. “We're planning to go to Olive Garden, we're planning to go to</br>     Chili's, but that's very expensive. But, I mean, we like Chili's. We want</br>     to go Olive Garden. Let's go.” Just for being curious, they learn. There</br>     are a lot of Olive Gardens. We have Wendy's here in Reforma. We’ve been</br>     there and they're surprised, like, &quot;Is this in the States?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is in</br>     the States.&quot; Beautiful burgers, so you want to try them out. That's</br>     basically what, we don't have this discrimination in between people who</br>     want to learn the culture and the stores because most people here are not</br>     very curious about it. Most of them, I should say. There's very few people</br>     that learn.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     This is a sort of mini little group who are actually interested.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. College guys, university guys. Here we have a name for the guys that</br>     just live with their parents and they don't work. We call them Ninis</br>     [00:26:06]. They also are the ones that learn English a lot because they</br>     don't do anything at home but watch movies, play games. But they're very</br>     curious. They get to be very curious too.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     They don't discriminate against you.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, not really. No. They actually want to know more. They stick with you.</br>     They stick with you and we learn from them because we actually don't know</br>     where a place is. &quot;Hey, we want to try another thing&quot; especially food or</br>     restaurants or maybe a bar. &quot; Oh, you've never been to this place?&quot; &quot;We</br>     don't even know where it is,” “Let's go.&quot; We learn from them too. &quot;Oh this</br>     is a nice one, I've never been here.&quot; We actually get together, and they</br>     learn, we learn, and at the end we become very good friends and that's when</br>     we become the network. &quot;Get over here, what are you're doing there? You're</br>     getting little money. Come with us. Here's better now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     That's fascinating. To go back to something else, I asked you what you</br>     missed from the United States. Let me ask you that again. You said you</br>     missed the tastes. Can you expand on that?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I miss the taste. I miss the relaxation, everything that's around in the</br>     States. It's very –you don't stress that much. I used to travel around at</br>     work and the view is beautiful. There's a lot of places that are beautiful.</br>     I haven't had a chance to travel here. But the food, the American stuff,</br>     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American</br>     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a</br>     coffee, it’s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.</br>     &quot;Hey Beto.&quot; &quot;Hey my friend. Same?&quot; It was amazing. Something that we don't</br>     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat</br>     you, it's beautiful.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What do you mean the way they treat you?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Like they always smile at you. They actually say good morning, good</br>     afternoon. I never had a bad experience at a restaurant. Most likely, in a</br>     public area, never had a bad experience.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     When you went in there, he remembered your order.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. They remember my order. It was amazing because they got me there. Now</br>     I know why Starbucks puts your name on the little thing because by putting</br>     your name, it's like you are part of this place. They make you feel like</br>     you are part of that specific restaurant. Not like what you see in the</br>     movies. But I had a lot of restaurants where I used to go in, and they were</br>     all my friends and they told me here, &quot;Why don't you change your name when</br>     you, when you make- &quot; &quot;I don't have to, everybody knows Beto.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I go, they know Beto everywhere. Every time it's like, &quot;Beto, hey Beto,</br>     amigo, same?&quot; &quot;Yes. But now make a little bit more toasty.&quot; It is</br>     beautiful. I mean I got the taste of American food and all of the areas. I</br>     even went to Chinese places. There's a lot of people there. I mean I never</br>     had a bad experience. It was good.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     The last thing is, tell me this lasagna story again.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Oh, the lasagna.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Then I'll let you go.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [31:47] Okay, well we're talking about discrimination in this case. I was</br>     just cooking lasagna and my family told me, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;I'm</br>     cooking a lasagna. You guys want some?&quot; This was a beautiful lasagna in a</br>     crystal base. They told me, &quot;Why don't you cook something Mexican? You're</br>     in Mexico.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to cook, beans?&quot; &quot;Some beans, I don't</br>     know, something Mexican.&quot; &quot;But I love lasagna. You guys want to have some</br>     lasagna?&quot; &quot;No, it looks nasty. No.&quot; This is one of the things that you</br>     encounter when you're here that we're talking about people that are trying</br>     to learn and people who don’t want to know what's going on. It's like,</br>     &quot;Taste lasagna. Have a little taste?&quot; &quot;No but it looks nasty.&quot; &quot;It's just</br>     pasta there and then tomato. Take a little taste.&quot; &quot;No, I’ll just go back</br>     to my kitchen and have some beans and chicharron and all this Mexican</br>     food.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I mean, I like it, but I also like to have something from over there or</br>     what I used to eat over there. I brought my microwave. I'm living like I’m</br>     in the States. I mean I try to make my living like in the States: nice and</br>     easy. When I met my wife, I had all my stuff, my cooking stuff. She was</br>     like, &quot;What is this?&quot; I have my [inaudible 00:34:04] I don't know like</br>     heat, not the microwave. The other one.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     A toaster oven?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Toaster oven, yes. &quot;Why is that? What's that for?&quot; &quot;Well, I cook lasagna,</br>     and I make potatoes with cheese and I put a lot of stuff on it and I cook</br>     there.&quot; &quot;I didn't know you cook.&quot; &quot;Yes, I do.” Sometimes I don't like to</br>     eat a lot of greasy stuff from here. I do want something else. I want</br>     something that can remind me of the States. That's true. I cook. I also</br>     make, for myself, big pieces of meat, and I cook them there. Yes. It's</br>     like, &quot;Why are you like that?&quot; Because I used to go to restaurants, Black</br>     Angus. Oh my God, beautiful meat. I love meat. That reminds me of the meat.</br>     I can even have it medium like I like it. It's not that I really love to</br>     cook, but I have to cook because I want a little bit of over there.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What's the food that most reminds you of over there?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     American breakfast. It reminds me the most. American breakfast is the best.</br>     Sausages. I love sausages. When I had my first sausages with honey, it's</br>     like meat and sweet, but that taste in your mouth, it takes you to some</br>     other place. Like, this is good. It's like the American breakfast with</br>     sausages and bacon. I used to put a lot of honey syrup. It's like, &quot;This is</br>     great. Let me have another one.&quot; Or I used to stop by in the mornings.</br>     That's one of the things that really reminds me, because the morning there,</br>     everybody's awake early and there's a lot of places already open for you to</br>     have this good American breakfast. It reminds me a lot because you go</br>     there, and I have my hash browns, bacon, my big orange juice and coffee,</br>     American coffee. Here, well it's very tough to decide. There's nothing like</br>     over there. It reminds me a lot.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Remind me finally, where did you learn your English?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I learned English in California.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad</br>     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was</br>     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody</br>     was like, &quot;The new guy&quot; but I didn't know what they were talking about. And</br>     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL</br>     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I</br>     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had</br>     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that</br>     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was</br>     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class</br>     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling</br>     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts</br>     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. &quot;Huh?</br>     Okay.&quot; You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Okay. I heard about him.&quot;</br>     But then the language, I just heard the teacher going, &quot;Blah, blah, blah,</br>     blah, blah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay and I understood “Abraham Lincoln,” and that’s all. &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot;</br>     &quot;Good. What about him?&quot; Yes. It was difficult. Math? I didn't talk at all.</br>     I was good at math because I learned –here in Mexico, they're very good at</br>     math and still they are very good at math. My algebra teacher – It was a</br>     Chicano girl. I remember that Chicano girl. The teacher pointed at me for</br>     something and then the girl told me, &quot;Hey he's calling you. The teacher is</br>     calling you.&quot; She said that in Spanish. &quot;Mm-hmm. What you want me to do?</br>     What does he want me to do?&quot; &quot;He wants you to go to the board and complete</br>     the mathematic there.”</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Just go try to do it.&quot; She actually translated for the teacher, so I just</br>     went in without talking. I just finished the equation. It was an equation.</br>     The teacher was like, &quot;How do you do it? You got to show me how you do it.</br>     How'd you get that result?&quot; When he looked at me with those surprised eyes</br>     I was like, &quot;Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call</br>     my parents.&quot; Then the girl says, the translator said, &quot;How do you do it?&quot;</br>     &quot;Because that's how I learned to do it.&quot; &quot;Where do you learn to do it? He's</br>     asking where you-&quot; &quot;Mexico.&quot; &quot;He wants you to teach him how you did that.&quot;</br>     &quot;Well, this, this goes like this and you go like that&quot;. &quot;But how come you</br>     don't put anything on the board? How come you don't write anything? How</br>     come you just put the answer?&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Because in Mexico you just got to do the math in your head. My teachers</br>     will get mad if I do the math on the board. They don't like you to do</br>     that.&quot; Here, now this is different from my times. If you do a subtraction,</br>     you just do this subtraction. That's it. If you are going to do division,</br>     you just put the answer in and put the few steps down there. You don't do</br>     the minus thingy on the bottom and continue with the big line on the</br>     bottom. No, you just do the equation and that's it. My teacher was like,</br>     &quot;Okay, I'll teach you guys more. This guy is crazy.&quot; I remember when he</br>     called me crazy, &quot;This guy is crazy, how come he did this? I'll show you</br>     guys how to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     <span id="91348858-5991-4571-b1a3-5a95592c8120" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Learning English, Time in the US, School, Middle school">Anita:<br>

     Was he impressed?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     [42:45] He was impressed. He was impressed. When he taught them how to do<br>
     the equations, I already knew how to do them, and when he taught them how<br>
     to do the geometrical, that's how you call them, the geometrical, Pi and<br>
     try to get the– He drew a circle and, in the circle, just to get the<br>
     equation for you to, on the circle, make a pentagon, things like that. I<br>
     already knew how to do those in my head. &quot;You already knew?&quot; &quot;Yes. That's<br>
     what I learned here in Mexico.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>

     Yes, very surprised. He was very surprised, and he wanted to know how, and<br>

 <br>
     Was he respectful at all?<br>

 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Yes. Yes. He was. I remember one time he got me, it was like<br>
     [unintelligible 44:03], I mean they had this ticket for breakfast at that<br>
     time when you go pick up your breakfast and he's like, &quot;Here, I'll give you<br>
     an extra for you to take another breakfast tomorrow in the morning or<br>
     lunch.&quot; &quot;Thank you, teacher.&quot; I was just learning. &quot;How come you got all<br>
     this?&quot; &quot;Because I learned it in Mexico.&quot; &quot;They know more than us?” I don't<br>
     know, but here in Mexico I learned the hard way. Teachers were very tough<br>
     at that time. I had teachers that they actually pulled your hair if you<br>
     didn't bring your homework at that time. That's the teachers I had. When I<br>
     got there it was like, mathematics was like-<br>

 <br>
     Abraham Lincoln?<br>

 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     No, no, I didn't know who that was. I knew he was in in Washington sitting<br>
     down right there in a big sculpture. That's all. It's like, &quot;Abraham<br>
     Lincoln. Something about the Constitution.&quot; The Constitution? No, I don't<br>
     know what it is.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     But you learned.<br>

 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     I learned, yes. They used to put us, those cartoons for politics, I<br>
     remember I don't know how else to call it. I remember that with cartoons<br>
     they used to tell you about the amendments, the Constitution, who Abraham<br>
     Lincoln was. I didn't understand them. After a while, I just started<br>
     comprehending English and learning. But it was very difficult.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
     That's fascinating. To go back to something else, I asked you what you<br>
     missed from the United States. Let me ask you that again. You said you<br>
     missed the tastes. Can you expand on that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     I miss the taste. I miss the relaxation, everything that's around in the<br>
     States. It's very –you don't stress that much. I used to travel around at<br>
     work and the view is beautiful. There's a lot of places that are beautiful.<br>
     I haven't had a chance to travel here. But the food, the American stuff,<br>
     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American<br>
     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a<br>
     coffee, it’s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.<br>
     &quot;Hey Beto.&quot; &quot;Hey my friend. Same?&quot; It was amazing. Something that we don't<br>
     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat<br>
     you, it's beautiful.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
     What do you mean the way they treat you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Like they always smile at you. They actually say good morning, good<br>
     afternoon. I never had a bad experience at a restaurant. Most likely, in a<br>
     public area, never had a bad experience.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
     Yes. They remember my order. It was amazing because they got me there. Now<br>
     I know why Starbucks puts your name on the little thing because by putting<br>
     your name, it's like you are part of this place. They make you feel like<br>
     you are part of that specific restaurant. Not like what you see in the<br>
     movies. But I had a lot of restaurants where I used to go in, and they were<br>
     all my friends and they told me here, &quot;Why don't you change your name when<br>
     you, when you make- &quot; &quot;I don't have to, everybody knows Beto.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>

     I go, they know Beto everywhere. Every time it's like, &quot;Beto, hey Beto,<br>
     amigo, same?&quot; &quot;Yes. But now make a little bit more toasty.&quot; It is<br>
     beautiful. I mean I got the taste of American food and all of the areas. I<br>
     even went to Chinese places. There's a lot of people there. I mean I never<br>
     had a bad experience. It was good.<br>

     just cooking lasagna and my family told me, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;I'm<br>
     cooking a lasagna. You guys want some?&quot; This was a beautiful lasagna in a<br>
     crystal base. They told me, &quot;Why don't you cook something Mexican? You're<br>
     in Mexico.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to cook, beans?&quot; &quot;Some beans, I don't<br>
     know, something Mexican.&quot; &quot;But I love lasagna. You guys want to have some<br>
     lasagna?&quot; &quot;No, it looks nasty. No.&quot; This is one of the things that you<br>
     encounter when you're here that we're talking about people that are trying<br>
     to learn and people who don’t want to know what's going on. It's like,<br>
     &quot;Taste lasagna. Have a little taste?&quot; &quot;No but it looks nasty.&quot; &quot;It's just<br>
     pasta there and then tomato. Take a little taste.&quot; &quot;No, I’ll just go back<br>
     to my kitchen and have some beans and chicharron and all this Mexican<br>
     food.&quot;<br>

     I mean, I like it, but I also like to have something from over there or<br>
     what I used to eat over there. I brought my microwave. I'm living like I’m<br>
     in the States. I mean I try to make my living like in the States: nice and<br>
     easy. When I met my wife, I had all my stuff, my cooking stuff. She was<br>
     like, &quot;What is this?&quot; I have my [inaudible 00:34:04] I don't know like<br>
     heat, not the microwave. The other one.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     A toaster oven?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Toaster oven, yes. &quot;Why is that? What's that for?&quot; &quot;Well, I cook lasagna,<br>
     and I make potatoes with cheese and I put a lot of stuff on it and I cook<br>
     there.&quot; &quot;I didn't know you cook.&quot; &quot;Yes, I do.” Sometimes I don't like to<br>
     eat a lot of greasy stuff from here. I do want something else. I want<br>
     something that can remind me of the States. That's true. I cook. I also<br>
     make, for myself, big pieces of meat, and I cook them there. Yes. It's<br>
     like, &quot;Why are you like that?&quot; Because I used to go to restaurants, Black<br>
     Angus. Oh my God, beautiful meat. I love meat. That reminds me of the meat.<br>
     I can even have it medium like I like it. It's not that I really love to<br>
     cook, but I have to cook because I want a little bit of over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     What's the food that most reminds you of over there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     American breakfast. It reminds me the most. American breakfast is the best.<br>
     Sausages. I love sausages. When I had my first sausages with honey, it's<br>
     like meat and sweet, but that taste in your mouth, it takes you to some<br>
     other place. Like, this is good. It's like the American breakfast with<br>
     sausages and bacon. I used to put a lot of honey syrup. It's like, &quot;This is<br>
     great. Let me have another one.&quot; Or I used to stop by in the mornings.<br>
     That's one of the things that really reminds me, because the morning there,<br>
     everybody's awake early and there's a lot of places already open for you to<br>
     have this good American breakfast. It reminds me a lot because you go<br>
     there, and I have my hash browns, bacon, my big orange juice and coffee,<br>
     American coffee. Here, well it's very tough to decide. There's nothing like<br>
     over there. It reminds me a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
     That's fascinating. To go back to something else, I asked you what you<br>
     missed from the United States. Let me ask you that again. You said you<br>
     missed the tastes. Can you expand on that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     I miss the taste. I miss the relaxation, everything that's around in the<br>
     States. It's very –you don't stress that much. I used to travel around at<br>
     work and the view is beautiful. There's a lot of places that are beautiful.<br>
     I haven't had a chance to travel here. But the food, the American stuff,<br>
     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American<br>
     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a<br>
     coffee, it’s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.<br>
     &quot;Hey Beto.&quot; &quot;Hey my friend. Same?&quot; It was amazing. Something that we don't<br>
     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat<br>
     you, it's beautiful.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     What do you mean the way they treat you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Like they always smile at you. They actually say good morning, good<br>
     afternoon. I never had a bad experience at a restaurant. Most likely, in a<br>
     public area, never had a bad experience.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     When you went in there, he remembered your order.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Yes. They remember my order. It was amazing because they got me there. Now<br>
     I know why Starbucks puts your name on the little thing because by putting<br>
     your name, it's like you are part of this place. They make you feel like<br>
     you are part of that specific restaurant. Not like what you see in the<br>
     movies. But I had a lot of restaurants where I used to go in, and they were<br>
     all my friends and they told me here, &quot;Why don't you change your name when<br>
     you, when you make- &quot; &quot;I don't have to, everybody knows Beto.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     I go, they know Beto everywhere. Every time it's like, &quot;Beto, hey Beto,<br>
     amigo, same?&quot; &quot;Yes. But now make a little bit more toasty.&quot; It is<br>
     beautiful. I mean I got the taste of American food and all of the areas. I<br>
     even went to Chinese places. There's a lot of people there. I mean I never<br>
     had a bad experience. It was good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     The last thing is, tell me this lasagna story again.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Oh, the lasagna.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Then I'll let you go.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     [31:47] Okay, well we're talking about discrimination in this case. I was<br>
     just cooking lasagna and my family told me, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;I'm<br>
     cooking a lasagna. You guys want some?&quot; This was a beautiful lasagna in a<br>
     crystal base. They told me, &quot;Why don't you cook something Mexican? You're<br>
     in Mexico.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to cook, beans?&quot; &quot;Some beans, I don't<br>
     know, something Mexican.&quot; &quot;But I love lasagna. You guys want to have some<br>
     lasagna?&quot; &quot;No, it looks nasty. No.&quot; This is one of the things that you<br>
     encounter when you're here that we're talking about people that are trying<br>
     to learn and people who don’t want to know what's going on. It's like,<br>
     &quot;Taste lasagna. Have a little taste?&quot; &quot;No but it looks nasty.&quot; &quot;It's just<br>
     pasta there and then tomato. Take a little taste.&quot; &quot;No, I’ll just go back<br>
     to my kitchen and have some beans and chicharron and all this Mexican<br>
     food.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>

     I mean, I like it, but I also like to have something from over there or<br>

     like, &quot;Why are you like that?&quot; Because I used to go to restaurants, Black<br>
     Angus. Oh my God, beautiful meat. I love meat. That reminds me of the meat.<br>
     I can even have it medium like I like it. It's not that I really love to<br>
     cook, but I have to cook because I want a little bit of over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     What's the food that most reminds you of over there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     American breakfast. It reminds me the most. American breakfast is the best.<br>
     Sausages. I love sausages. When I had my first sausages with honey, it's<br>
     like meat and sweet, but that taste in your mouth, it takes you to some<br>
     other place. Like, this is good. It's like the American breakfast with<br>
     sausages and bacon. I used to put a lot of honey syrup. It's like, &quot;This is<br>
     great. Let me have another one.&quot; Or I used to stop by in the mornings.<br>
     That's one of the things that really reminds me, because the morning there,<br>
     everybody's awake early and there's a lot of places already open for you to<br>
     have this good American breakfast. It reminds me a lot because you go<br>
     there, and I have my hash browns, bacon, my big orange juice and coffee,<br>
     American coffee. Here, well it's very tough to decide. There's nothing like<br>
     over there. It reminds me a lot.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
     That's fascinating. To go back to something else, I asked you what you<br>
     missed from the United States. Let me ask you that again. You said you<br>
     missed the tastes. Can you expand on that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     I miss the taste. I miss the relaxation, everything that's around in the<br>
     States. It's very –you don't stress that much. I used to travel around at<br>
     work and the view is beautiful. There's a lot of places that are beautiful.<br>
     I haven't had a chance to travel here. But the food, the American stuff,<br>
     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American<br>
     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a<br>
     coffee, it’s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.<br>
     &quot;Hey Beto.&quot; &quot;Hey my friend. Same?&quot; It was amazing. Something that we don't<br>
     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat<br>
     you, it's beautiful.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     What do you mean the way they treat you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Like they always smile at you. They actually say good morning, good<br>
     afternoon. I never had a bad experience at a restaurant. Most likely, in a<br>
     public area, never had a bad experience.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     When you went in there, he remembered your order.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Yes. They remember my order. It was amazing because they got me there. Now<br>
     I know why Starbucks puts your name on the little thing because by putting<br>
     your name, it's like you are part of this place. They make you feel like<br>
     you are part of that specific restaurant. Not like what you see in the<br>
     movies. But I had a lot of restaurants where I used to go in, and they were<br>
     all my friends and they told me here, &quot;Why don't you change your name when<br>
     you, when you make- &quot; &quot;I don't have to, everybody knows Beto.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     I go, they know Beto everywhere. Every time it's like, &quot;Beto, hey Beto,<br>
     amigo, same?&quot; &quot;Yes. But now make a little bit more toasty.&quot; It is<br>
     beautiful. I mean I got the taste of American food and all of the areas. I<br>
     even went to Chinese places. There's a lot of people there. I mean I never<br>
     had a bad experience. It was good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     The last thing is, tell me this lasagna story again.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Oh, the lasagna.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Then I'll let you go.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     [31:47] Okay, well we're talking about discrimination in this case. I was<br>
     just cooking lasagna and my family told me, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;I'm<br>
     cooking a lasagna. You guys want some?&quot; This was a beautiful lasagna in a<br>
     crystal base. They told me, &quot;Why don't you cook something Mexican? You're<br>
     in Mexico.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to cook, beans?&quot; &quot;Some beans, I don't<br>
     know, something Mexican.&quot; &quot;But I love lasagna. You guys want to have some<br>
     lasagna?&quot; &quot;No, it looks nasty. No.&quot; This is one of the things that you<br>
     encounter when you're here that we're talking about people that are trying<br>
     to learn and people who don’t want to know what's going on. It's like,<br>
     &quot;Taste lasagna. Have a little taste?&quot; &quot;No but it looks nasty.&quot; &quot;It's just<br>
     pasta there and then tomato. Take a little taste.&quot; &quot;No, I’ll just go back<br>
     to my kitchen and have some beans and chicharron and all this Mexican<br>
     food.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     I mean, I like it, but I also like to have something from over there or<br>
     what I used to eat over there. I brought my microwave. I'm living like I’m<br>
     in the States. I mean I try to make my living like in the States: nice and<br>
     easy. When I met my wife, I had all my stuff, my cooking stuff. She was<br>
     like, &quot;What is this?&quot; I have my [inaudible 00:34:04] I don't know like<br>
     heat, not the microwave. The other one.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     A toaster oven?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Toaster oven, yes. &quot;Why is that? What's that for?&quot; &quot;Well, I cook lasagna,<br>
     and I make potatoes with cheese and I put a lot of stuff on it and I cook<br>
     there.&quot; &quot;I didn't know you cook.&quot; &quot;Yes, I do.” Sometimes I don't like to<br>
     eat a lot of greasy stuff from here. I do want something else. I want<br>
     something that can remind me of the States. That's true. I cook. I also<br>
     make, for myself, big pieces of meat, and I cook them there. Yes. It's<br>
     like, &quot;Why are you like that?&quot; Because I used to go to restaurants, Black<br>

 <br>
    </span> Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Remind me finally, where did you learn your English?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I learned English in California.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad</br>     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was</br>     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody</br>     was like, &quot;The new guy&quot; but I didn't know what they were talking about. And</br>     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL</br>     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I</br>     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had</br>     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that</br>     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was</br>     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class</br>     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling</br>     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts</br>     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. &quot;Huh?</br>     Okay.&quot; You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Okay. I heard about him.&quot;</br>     But then the language, I just heard the teacher going, &quot;Blah, blah, blah,</br>     blah, blah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay and I understood “Abraham Lincoln,” and that’s all. &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot;</br>     &quot;Good. What about him?&quot; Yes. It was difficult. Math? I didn't talk at all.</br>     I was good at math because I learned –here in Mexico, they're very good at</br>     math and still they are very good at math. My algebra teacher – It was a</br>     Chicano girl. I remember that Chicano girl. The teacher pointed at me for</br>     something and then the girl told me, &quot;Hey he's calling you. The teacher is</br>     calling you.&quot; She said that in Spanish. &quot;Mm-hmm. What you want me to do?</br>     What does he want me to do?&quot; &quot;He wants you to go to the board and complete</br>     the mathematic there.”</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Just go try to do it.&quot; She actually translated for the teacher, so I just</br>     went in without talking. I just finished the equation. It was an equation.</br>     The teacher was like, &quot;How do you do it? You got to show me how you do it.</br>     How'd you get that result?&quot; When he looked at me with those surprised eyes</br>     I was like, &quot;Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call</br>     my parents.&quot; Then the girl says, the translator said, &quot;How do you do it?&quot;</br>     &quot;Because that's how I learned to do it.&quot; &quot;Where do you learn to do it? He's</br>     asking where you-&quot; &quot;Mexico.&quot; &quot;He wants you to teach him how you did that.&quot;</br>     &quot;Well, this, this goes like this and you go like that&quot;. &quot;But how come you</br>     don't put anything on the board? How come you don't write anything? How</br>     come you just put the answer?&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Because in Mexico you just got to do the math in your head. My teachers</br>     will get mad if I do the math on the board. They don't like you to do</br>     that.&quot; Here, now this is different from my times. If you do a subtraction,</br>     you just do this subtraction. That's it. If you are going to do division,</br>     you just put the answer in and put the few steps down there. You don't do</br>     the minus thingy on the bottom and continue with the big line on the</br>     bottom. No, you just do the equation and that's it. My teacher was like,</br>     &quot;Okay, I'll teach you guys more. This guy is crazy.&quot; I remember when he</br>     called me crazy, &quot;This guy is crazy, how come he did this? I'll show you</br>     guys how to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he impressed?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [42:45] He was impressed. He was impressed. When he taught them how to do</br>     the equations, I already knew how to do them, and when he taught them how</br>     to do the geometrical, that's how you call them, the geometrical, Pi and</br>     try to get the– He drew a circle and, in the circle, just to get the</br>     equation for you to, on the circle, make a pentagon, things like that. I</br>     already knew how to do those in my head. &quot;You already knew?&quot; &quot;Yes. That's</br>     what I learned here in Mexico.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he surprised that a Mexican knew that?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes, very surprised. He was very surprised, and he wanted to know how, and</br>     I showed him how. He used to-</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he respectful at all?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. Yes. He was. I remember one time he got me, it was like</br>     [unintelligible 44:03], I mean they had this ticket for breakfast at that</br>     time when you go pick up your breakfast and he's like, &quot;Here, I'll give you</br>     an extra for you to take another breakfast tomorrow in the morning or</br>     lunch.&quot; &quot;Thank you, teacher.&quot; I was just learning. &quot;How come you got all</br>     this?&quot; &quot;Because I learned it in Mexico.&quot; &quot;They know more than us?” I don't</br>     know, but here in Mexico I learned the hard way. Teachers were very tough</br>     at that time. I had teachers that they actually pulled your hair if you</br>     didn't bring your homework at that time. That's the teachers I had. When I</br>     got there it was like, mathematics was like-</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Abraham Lincoln?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, no, I didn't know who that was. I knew he was in in Washington sitting</br>     down right there in a big sculpture. That's all. It's like, &quot;Abraham</br>     Lincoln. Something about the Constitution.&quot; The Constitution? No, I don't</br>     know what it is.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But you learned.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I learned, yes. They used to put us, those cartoons for politics, I</br>     remember I don't know how else to call it. I remember that with cartoons</br>     they used to tell you about the amendments, the Constitution, who Abraham</br>     Lincoln was. I didn't understand them. After a while, I just started</br>     comprehending English and learning. But it was very difficult.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Did you recite the Pledge of Allegiance?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. Yes, I did. I didn't know it, I was just [mumbling 00:46:07] didn't</br>     know. But then I learned it. I remember we used to do the Pledge of</br>     Allegiance, it was every morning, every morning. After that, I don't know</br>     what happened to schools. They stopped doing it, but it was every day. I</br>     used to do it every day. The Pledge of Allegiance. I even learned the</br>     American anthem, but all of a sudden everything started changing. I really</br>     don't know why. Times change. Things change. It reminds me a lot when I</br>     used to ride my bicycle to school, put the lock on it. I felt like in the</br>     movies. When I was little, I felt like I was in the movies, because of me</br>     on a bicycle, putting my bicycle and locking it. I felt like the Back to</br>     the Future guy, and I always wanted some Nikes like this guy. It was</br>     difficult for the language. It was difficult for the culture because it got</br>     me mixed up with the American culture and Chicano culture. There was a big</br>     division there because I had to learn from both.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     That's when you get like a Chicano burrito, Americans potato, mashed</br>     potatoes in this. Then, okay, Chicano goes to LA Dodgers stadium, and he's</br>     American. Cinco de Mayo, he's Mexican. What's going on? It's like, what's</br>     going on with this guy? But then American culture, [sings] “take me out to</br>     the ballgame.” I asked my mom a lot of stuff. I asked my dad a lot of</br>     stuff, and I believe I mentioned when you asked me how I felt, American or</br>     Mexican? That's what they taught me. &quot;You're Mexican. You're Mexican, you</br>     know the pyramids. You been there, you studied there. You remember this?&quot;</br>     &quot;Yes.&quot; Okay. Then you're Mexican. You're not American, but you're learning</br>     the American culture. Okay? Chicano, it's different. Way, totally,</br>     completely out of, don't pay attention. Yes. Pay attention. But don't go</br>     too much into it. You're Mexican.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Were they worried that the Chicano's were sort of gang members-</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. At that specific time, I remember I didn't know about the drive-by</br>     shootings because I've been, well we were afraid of those at that time and</br>     that's what they were trying to avoid. Since I had my childhood right here,</br>     which I remember too, I didn't like Chicano that much or the gang members</br>     at all. I don't have tattoos. When they, &quot;Oh I put on my new tattoo.&quot; I</br>     just gave them my like sign here. &quot;Good for you.&quot; Don't like tattoos. I</br>     just look at them and go, &quot;Good for you.&quot; But that's it.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You think that having your childhood here made a difference because you</br>     went later.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     A lot of the people we talked to who went as children became sort of street</br>     people. Because you went later you think it was different?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. I believe because of what we had before here in Mexico. We had a lot</br>     of pressure at school. I don't know, this new expression about bullying is</br>     brand new. Bullying. You didn't have this here in Mexico. There was no</br>     bullying. You just got out of the school, &quot;Okay, why are you doing this to</br>     me,&quot; and you fight. That's it. No words, no nothing, no bullying. It was</br>     like, &quot;I'm not fat. I'm not skinny. I'm not short.&quot; No. Teachers were very,</br>     very strict. Also, my cousins my age, we lived this experience with the</br>     teachers who were very strict. You don't do this, you don't do that. I</br>     remember them having my hands or my fingers together and they had a ruler,</br>     and they hit me if I didn't have the homework, if I was misbehaving.</br>     Teachers were very– you have to respect them at that time. When you go to a</br>     different country, and you had this Chicano culture that there, I mean, no</br>     respect. It was like, &quot;No, that's not what I learned.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Kids who are undocumented, boys who went to the States as very, very young</br>     children sometimes become part of gangs. You believe that because you went</br>     to Mexican school and you had a certain set of values, you went a different</br>     way.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Exactly. Most people that I met in the States, we had these ESL classes. I</br>     should say that 70% lived here, and the values that you mentioned, the</br>     values were very, very settled. Not in the next 30%, the ones that maybe</br>     because of here they just were immigrants, and they were poor. I mean, I'm</br>     not saying that I was rich, I was poor too. But I mean they were having a</br>     hard time here in Mexico. Probably they were trying to find out what they</br>     were going to do with their lives. Even though we were kids, we knew like,</br>     &quot;I don't like this, this Chicano, this gang member thing.&quot; I was invited</br>     many times to join them because of discrimination with them. I never had</br>     this bad experience with an American telling me, &quot;You're a wetback.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, I had the bad experience with Chicanos telling me I'm a wetback, and I</br>     had a lot of fights there. I used to tell them, &quot;You know what? I'm a</br>     wetback, but guess what? I know what I am. I'm Mexican. You don't know what</br>     you are. You don't know. Tell me what you are, and I’ll respect you.&quot; That</br>     got me into a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble because that's what my mom</br>     told me. &quot;They don't know what they are. You know what you are. You're</br>     Mexican. They don't know.&quot; She taught me about it. “You know, they go to</br>     Dodger Stadium, they're Americans, hotdogs, beer, all this. Cinco de Mayo,</br>     they're Mexican. So tell me what they are.”</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Do you ever go-&quot; &quot;Yes, I go to the Dodger Stadium.&quot; &quot;Okay. How do you</br>     feel?&quot; &quot;Good. A new thing. That's a new thing. That's an American culture</br>     thing.” “You joined them, right?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;But what are you?&quot; Mexican. You</br>     don't have to be wearing all these Dodgers thingys. Because I used to wear</br>     my regular clothes to a Dodger Stadium whenever. You don't go like wearing</br>     you cap and, &quot;Oh, I'm a Dodger fan.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Did you wear a Mexican Jersey?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, it was regular. Yes.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Were you a soccer fan?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     A little bit, not much. I was more into American football when I was</br>     little. I just admire when they used to train at high school. I loved that.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Who was your team?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     At that moment, we had this team which was the LA Raiders. They were my</br>     actual team and the Rams. Yeah, but I don't know what happened. They moved</br>     to Oakland. We don't have no more, like, the LA team. It is in Oakland, but</br>     we don't get this feeling like, &quot;Oh my team.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Final question, did you have American friends too?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No. Well, yes. A few of them, but I was in middle school. After high</br>     school, not many. It was all mixed up. Americans actually started moving</br>     when the Chicano movement was there, they started moving. High school I</br>     didn't have that much American friends.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Who were your friends?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Mexicans and black people. A lot of black people. I met a lot of black</br>     people.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     They accepted you?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     They had to.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What do you mean?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     It was very tough because they wanted us to stick with them as, I don't</br>     know. Schools are like– they do have certain stuff going on with gang</br>     related things and country stuff, and they wanted us to be part of them.</br>     Whenever an American would say something or do something, we're together,</br>     but we actually said, &quot;No.&quot; We're good friends. But that's it.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You had a strong home environment. Your mother and father were there?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     They were happy?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     They were happy because they didn't know what I was going through. I never</br>     told them my experiences at school because of the respect I have. I knew if</br>     I would tell them something that I was going through, because of Mexican</br>     culture before, they were very strict. I was afraid of telling them, &quot;You</br>     know what, I'm going through this struggle at school, these difficulties&quot;</br>     because my dad would tell me, &quot;You're just going to study. That's why</br>     you're going. You're just going to study. Don't pay attention to anything,</br>     and I don't want you to do anything stupid. You're to go to school and</br>     that's it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I knew his answer already. I knew what he was going to tell me, so I just</br>     decided just to continue with my stuff. Now that I'm older. We have this</br>     conversation. I had this conversation with him. &quot;Did you know about me</br>     having these difficulties with Chicanos, with black people? Did you know</br>     they wanted me to become a gang member? Did you know all this?&quot; &quot;No. How</br>     come you didn't tell me?&quot; &quot;Because I was afraid of you knowing that I was</br>     having this problem because I knew you weren't going to do nothing. You,</br>     you, you were not going to take me back to Mexico because we were already</br>     here.&quot; He's like, &quot;I didn't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How did you resist becoming a gang member?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I resisted because I really didn't like it. Because of the culture here in</br>     Mexico, you don't fight for a street. Don't fight for a street. We fight, I</br>     mean we have this argument, because you took maybe something off me but not</br>     because of a street. We know it's stupid. We're like, &quot;Oh, that's your</br>     street? You own it? Go for it.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It's your street? What about the</br>     street? That's good.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Thank you so much<span id="7cab1ed3-ccba-4593-84ce-432ec9e785ae" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs, Call Centers"></span><span id="de07a583-791a-4b71-974b-2d26cf11dc8f" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs, Call Centers, Dead end">But<br>
     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end<br>
     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,<br>
     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all<br>
     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small<br>
     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that<br>
     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try<br>
     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff<br>
     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down<br>
     to eat. That's when I was like, &quot;Okay, what am I doing here? They're making<br>
     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.&quot;<br>
     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're<br>
     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is<br>
     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two<br>
     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back<br>
     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general<br>
     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I<br>
     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the<br>
     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or<br>
     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]<br>
     again. You go back to [_____], you go back to start at where you started<br>
     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a<br>
     regular agent. I mean I don't have any problems, such as if I become a<br>
     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much<br>
     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's<br>
     the way I see it. After that, you hit the wall. You don't actually get to<br>
     move forward.<br>

     recording yesterday. Rather than going over everything, tell me about what<br>
     it's like to work at a call center.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Well, a call center is a great place. I have nothing to say bad about call<br>
     centers because basically you're in the process of making money. Right?</span> But</br>     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end</br>     point.

It's very difficult.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general</br>     manager, right?

You don't actually get to</br>     move forward.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I'm pretty sure the call centers are doing their best to help us out, but I</br>     don't know. It is very difficult. You're actually waiting to see what's</br>     going to happen. Every time you go to a call center, you wait to see what's</br>     going to happen next. Okay, I'm here right now. This is a good account. I'm</br>     getting my money, but what if it moves? For us it's difficult because, as</br>     being in this business, I think it is a business, I got to invest my time</br>     and I’ve got to save money because I don't know what's going to happen</br>     next. That's why I've been in so many call centers here.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You told me you've been to a lot of centers.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I've been to a lot of call centers, a lot. Tell me about it, you can ask me</br>     about the call centers, the things I’ve done, the accounts. I've been to a</br>     MasterCard, Kohls, I've even sold packages for cable TV, all those things.</br>     You get to learn too. That's one of the advantages because you're learning</br>     too, because you're managing money, people's money, you actually get to</br>     know. I mean, on my end, that's what I've learned. I don't talk bad about</br>     the call centers. I learned a lot. I never, well, in the States I never had</br>     a credit card due to the fact that I was an illegal immigrant. But here I</br>     have been managing people's credit cards, and it's like, &quot;Oh, I didn't know</br>     about this.&quot; I mean, right now I'm in a call center where you lease phones.</br>     I was surprised about leasing phones. I never heard about leasing phones. I</br>     heard about leasing TVs, leasing cars, but phones?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right now, I'm leasing the phones and have to explain to them that they're</br>     not financing the phones. I learned other stuff, like when you finance, and</br>     you rent is a completely different thing. You’re learning a lot. you really</br>     get to learn a lot about call centers.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     When you call up these call centers or customer service and you end up at a</br>     call center, people know so much. With all this movement, how do you master</br>     everything you need to know to be able to offer that service?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay, well actually, at every call center... It's amazing when you go in</br>     and apply at a different call center. Because the first time I got to a</br>     call center, it was difficult for me when the company moved. For me, moving</br>     to another one is like, &quot;What am I going to do? I just know how to manage</br>     this system.&quot; But it’s amazing that most of the call centers have a similar</br>     system. They manage a similar system. I mean they all go and manage this</br>     system called Abaya, which is the one that you get to answer the phones.</br>     Most companies have the Abaya. I really don't know why, but all of them are</br>     similar. Okay?</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     After that, most of the steps that you follow are the same. Even though</br>     they're different products, the steps are very similar. You don't get</br>     really trapped in like what am I going to do next? No, it's very similar</br>     and they actually give you a very good training and you get to know, “I</br>     used to do this at this call center.” I used to manage, for example,</br>     setting up a credit card to make a payment. Most of the systems are the</br>     same. It's like, okay, I know how to do this. Most of the accounts you get</br>     the personal information about the customer, so you have to get the</br>     customer's information. You know that you have to set it up on tabs and all</br>     the squares but it's very similar.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But dealing with Kohls, are we talking about the clothing? Dealing with</br>     customers calling about Kohls and dealing with customers calling about</br>     leasing a phone is a completely different product.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. Different products, same process.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How do you learn about the product? Don't you have to know about the</br>     product?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes, they teach you about each product and how it works. The similar thing</br>     is at every call center you must ask for personal information. After that</br>     then it goes to product, which is not difficult. It's just the process that</br>     – in this case, for example, Kohls, clothing product. They teach you. You</br>     don't have to learn about each and every clothing. No, it's numbers. All of</br>     the clothes go by certain numbers that you'd have to click in. It's called</br>     S-K-Us, right? Here in the phone industry, we manage the phones, but it's</br>     the same at Kohls because you're not managing clothing, but you manage a</br>     number. Okay? You click on the number and the basic number pulls out the</br>     brand of the phone. I know on our end Samsung Galaxy or an iPhone is called</br>     iPhone or Samsung, but in this industry it's a number. That's why you don't</br>     really get to move like, okay, I need to learn woman's miniskirts or a</br>     woman's bra or a bunch of phones. Like, &quot;What am I going to do?&quot; I mean</br>     it's been a long time. “Nokia? Somebody is asking me for a Nokia? They're</br>     gone.” But yes, you just put on the number and it's amazing. “Nokia It's</br>     been a long time since I've seen you. I had you once, and you fell down,</br>     but you never die.”</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Is it boring?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Sometimes it is. It is something that is very routine. It's a routine.</br>     Especially when you're back-to-back, when you have one call after another,</br>     then it is boring. Even the call centers try to help you out with certain</br>     days, like, &quot;Okay, we'll take you out for, I don't know, a little</br>     breakfast.&quot; Still, you're going back to the call. It is boring sometimes.</br>     It's very stressful. Managing people, customer service, face to face or on</br>     the phone, is difficult. Dealing with people is, I'm not going to say the</br>     worst because we have to deal with people, but it is very, very difficult.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You're dealing with angry people.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I deal with very angry people. Yes. I have to breathe. I put myself on a</br>     little mute. I listen to everything they got to say. Sometimes they tell</br>     me, I mean what customers tell me is like, &quot;I'm not angry about you, I'm</br>     angry about the product. I'm angry about the company.&quot; But I have to take</br>     it because I'm still the company, right? At the end, you're the company and</br>     you work for this company. You’ve got to talk good about the company that</br>     you work for everywhere you go. You have to go back and say, &quot;Yes ma'am,</br>     let's go ahead and verify what the issue is, and I'd be more than glad to</br>     help you out with whatever. Let me exhaust my help. Let me see the most I</br>     can do for you. Even if I have to talk to my supervisor and you need to</br>     talk to him, but it has to be fixed.&quot; That's how it is.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You also told me yesterday about the ways in which you have this kind of</br>     network of people who all moved, spread news.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. At a call center you turn out to be friends with everybody. For</br>     example, I left a lot of friends at some other call centers. If I move on</br>     for better pay, we just move to another call center and verify if they</br>     actually pay good. I have friends that we manage to, we actually call each</br>     other, &quot;You know what? I'm here at this call center. They're paying, I</br>     don't know, 3,500 3,200 why don't you come over?&quot; That’s like, &quot;Okay wait,</br>     but don't come yet. Let me just get my first paycheck, and I'll let you</br>     know if it's true.&quot; So it’s like, &quot;Okay, let me know.&quot; I have to wait. I’ve</br>     even waited 15 days or if he just got in, for example, on the 5th of a</br>     specific month, I have to wait because they don't get paid exactly on the</br>     15th. They would probably get paid on the 31st, and I’d have to wait a</br>     whole month waiting for him to show me his paycheck.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;You know what? Yes, it is true. They're paying this much.&quot; Then I have to</br>     go, &quot;Hey sir, I've got to go.&quot; &quot;Why are you going? Why are you leaving?&quot;</br>     &quot;Well, I found a better place.&quot; Most likely they don't retain you, they</br>     don't try to keep you because this is a very rotating place. You rotate</br>     time to time. That's how we communicate through this networking as you call</br>     it. &quot;I'm here, I'm at TeleTech, come here, there's a brand-new account and</br>     they're going to be paying good.&quot; That's how we travel around.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Let's say you’re in TeleTech or you're in one place and some place opens</br>     and it's a new account that pays better. What happens to the old account?</br>     Everybody leaves and then what?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Most likely everybody leaves. It's like somebody is crying wolf. &quot;Let's</br>     go,&quot; and eventually they all leave. I mean they say, &quot;I'm sorry&quot; but I</br>     don't know what exactly happens. I've seen companies that, for example,</br>     there was a brand-new place, an AT&amp;amp;T. As soon as they opened, everybody</br>     took off. The call center got empty.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     The other call center?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     The other call center was empty. They started setting up advertisements</br>     everywhere. &quot;Hey, we need people, we need people.&quot; But that's how it is.</br>     That's basically what we want is really, we're trying to get a place with</br>     stability and a good pay.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Do the other call centers raise their pay?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Not the call center, there are accounts that pay good.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But the ones that lose when everybody runs off to AT&amp;amp;T and leaves their</br>     other jobs. Do the other call centers sometimes increase their pay to</br>     retain?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No. No. I guess we talk about it. You asked me about what happens to the</br>     new immigrants that come here. They're the ones that come on to take our</br>     place because they don't know what's going on. They just, &quot;Oh, a call</br>     center. I'm going to get 2000 pesos, I don't know, every two weeks.&quot; It's</br>     good because they are new immigrants. Even if we know about it, and they</br>     become our friends for a little while before we move on to the other call</br>     center. We let them know, &quot;You know what? Why don't you come with us?&quot; But</br>     they're afraid. &quot;No, I need to get experience.&quot; As soon as they get</br>     experience, &quot;What was I thinking? What happened in my head that I was stuck</br>     right here?&quot; That's what they do, and then they call us up. &quot;Hey, do you</br>     think they're still hiring?&quot; &quot;Yes. Come over.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Roughly what percentage of the people in the call centers lived in the</br>     States, and what percentage are Mexican would you say?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay, I will tell you in my head that 25% are from Mexico, 75% are</br>     immigrants. People nowadays, from here, start learning English. It is</br>     becoming very popular to learn English. I've seen people from here that</br>     don't need to work. They actually just try to improve their English, and</br>     they get into a call center.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     As a way of improving their English?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Exactly. Not to get money. Well, they actually are taking advantage of it</br>     because they're getting money, and they're learning English. That's the</br>     25%. Some of them, because they're in school, they learned it maybe by</br>     playing games. When we're in training and we have to actually introduce</br>     ourselves, I'm amazed that they learned English playing games online or by</br>     watching movies. I was like, it took me a lot in the States to learn</br>     English because I was just listening to English. But it took me a little</br>     while and they're just like, &quot;Oh I learned it by watching, I don't know,</br>     Finding Nemo and Toy Story.” I'm laughing at all of it, &quot;Yeah you did.</br>     Yes.&quot; We've had this guy introducing himself, he actually knew the Toy</br>     Story song and I was like, &quot;Yes, you did learn English with Toy Story.&quot;</br>     That's the 25%. Some of them, they do need it because they're actually in</br>     school here, they study they're actually just trying to keep on learning</br>     and move on.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What's the relationship between the two groups? Is there like a solidarity</br>     between the returning immigrants and then the Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     We're together. We're actually together. We become very good friends</br>     because this is what happens when they learn English, they get to learn the</br>     culture. They get to learn the American culture by all these games, by</br>     watching the movies. We can have a conversation. If someone here does not</br>     have the same ideas, we don't actually have this problem. Some of them ask</br>     us, &quot;Hey, you've been in the States, how is this? How is that? You've been</br>     to Disneyland?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Mickey mouse is big?&quot; But that's simple stuff. They</br>     don't ask much. I'll give you another example. I had a friend that didn't</br>     know, &quot;Hey, what is a money order?&quot; &quot;That's like a voucher. We don't have</br>     these here.&quot; “Oh, that's a money order.”</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     A money order?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     A money order. Yes. &quot;I don't know what's a money order.&quot; &quot;Okay. That's a</br>     voucher. You go to the liquor store, you go to the store, you ask for</br>     certain amount and then they put some numbers, and that's money.&quot; &quot;Really?</br>     How come we don't have this here?&quot; &quot;Here I don't think that’s going to be a</br>     good idea.&quot; They don't know those things because they've never been there.</br>     But that's certain little things.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     That's really interesting because a lot of other people talk about the</br>     discrimination that they face here for speaking English.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     It looks like things are a little different in a call center. It's like an</br>     oasis maybe.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. Because they get involved with us. They want to know. They are a</br>     very curious people that already learned or are trying to learn the</br>     language. “We're planning to go to Olive Garden, we're planning to go to</br>     Chili's, but that's very expensive. But, I mean, we like Chili's. We want</br>     to go Olive Garden. Let's go.” Just for being curious, they learn. There</br>     are a lot of Olive Gardens. We have Wendy's here in Reforma. We’ve been</br>     there and they're surprised, like, &quot;Is this in the States?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is in</br>     the States.&quot; Beautiful burgers, so you want to try them out. That's</br>     basically what, we don't have this discrimination in between people who</br>     want to learn the culture and the stores because most people here are not</br>     very curious about it. Most of them, I should say. There's very few people</br>     that learn.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     This is a sort of mini little group who are actually interested.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. College guys, university guys. Here we have a name for the guys that</br>     just live with their parents and they don't work. We call them Ninis</br>     [00:26:06]. They also are the ones that learn English a lot because they</br>     don't do anything at home but watch movies, play games. But they're very</br>     curious. They get to be very curious too.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     They don't discriminate against you.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, not really. No. They actually want to know more. They stick with you.</br>     They stick with you and we learn from them because we actually don't know</br>     where a place is. &quot;Hey, we want to try another thing&quot; especially food or</br>     restaurants or maybe a bar. &quot; Oh, you've never been to this place?&quot; &quot;We</br>     don't even know where it is,” “Let's go.&quot; We learn from them too. &quot;Oh this</br>     is a nice one, I've never been here.&quot; We actually get together, and they</br>     learn, we learn, and at the end we become very good friends and that's when</br>     we become the network. &quot;Get over here, what are you're doing there? You're</br>     getting little money. Come with us. Here's better now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     That's fascinating. To go back to something else, I asked you what you</br>     missed from the United States. Let me ask you that again. You said you</br>     missed the tastes. Can you expand on that?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I miss the taste. I miss the relaxation, everything that's around in the</br>     States. It's very –you don't stress that much. I used to travel around at</br>     work and the view is beautiful. There's a lot of places that are beautiful.</br>     I haven't had a chance to travel here. But the food, the American stuff,</br>     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American</br>     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a</br>     coffee, it’s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.</br>     &quot;Hey Beto.&quot; &quot;Hey my friend. Same?&quot; It was amazing. Something that we don't</br>     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat</br>     you, it's beautiful.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What do you mean the way they treat you?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Like they always smile at you. They actually say good morning, good</br>     afternoon. I never had a bad experience at a restaurant. Most likely, in a</br>     public area, never had a bad experience.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     When you went in there, he remembered your order.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. They remember my order. It was amazing because they got me there. Now</br>     I know why Starbucks puts your name on the little thing because by putting</br>     your name, it's like you are part of this place. They make you feel like</br>     you are part of that specific restaurant. Not like what you see in the</br>     movies. But I had a lot of restaurants where I used to go in, and they were</br>     all my friends and they told me here, &quot;Why don't you change your name when</br>     you, when you make- &quot; &quot;I don't have to, everybody knows Beto.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I go, they know Beto everywhere. Every time it's like, &quot;Beto, hey Beto,</br>     amigo, same?&quot; &quot;Yes. But now make a little bit more toasty.&quot; It is</br>     beautiful. I mean I got the taste of American food and all of the areas. I</br>     even went to Chinese places. There's a lot of people there. I mean I never</br>     had a bad experience. It was good.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     The last thing is, tell me this lasagna story again.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Oh, the lasagna.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Then I'll let you go.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [31:47] Okay, well we're talking about discrimination in this case. I was</br>     just cooking lasagna and my family told me, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;I'm</br>     cooking a lasagna. You guys want some?&quot; This was a beautiful lasagna in a</br>     crystal base. They told me, &quot;Why don't you cook something Mexican? You're</br>     in Mexico.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to cook, beans?&quot; &quot;Some beans, I don't</br>     know, something Mexican.&quot; &quot;But I love lasagna. You guys want to have some</br>     lasagna?&quot; &quot;No, it looks nasty. No.&quot; This is one of the things that you</br>     encounter when you're here that we're talking about people that are trying</br>     to learn and people who don’t want to know what's going on. It's like,</br>     &quot;Taste lasagna. Have a little taste?&quot; &quot;No but it looks nasty.&quot; &quot;It's just</br>     pasta there and then tomato. Take a little taste.&quot; &quot;No, I’ll just go back</br>     to my kitchen and have some beans and chicharron and all this Mexican</br>     food.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I mean, I like it, but I also like to have something from over there or</br>     what I used to eat over there. I brought my microwave. I'm living like I’m</br>     in the States. I mean I try to make my living like in the States: nice and</br>     easy. When I met my wife, I had all my stuff, my cooking stuff. She was</br>     like, &quot;What is this?&quot; I have my [inaudible 00:34:04] I don't know like</br>     heat, not the microwave. The other one.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     A toaster oven?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Toaster oven, yes. &quot;Why is that? What's that for?&quot; &quot;Well, I cook lasagna,</br>     and I make potatoes with cheese and I put a lot of stuff on it and I cook</br>     there.&quot; &quot;I didn't know you cook.&quot; &quot;Yes, I do.” Sometimes I don't like to</br>     eat a lot of greasy stuff from here. I do want something else. I want</br>     something that can remind me of the States. That's true. I cook. I also</br>     make, for myself, big pieces of meat, and I cook them there. Yes. It's</br>     like, &quot;Why are you like that?&quot; Because I used to go to restaurants, Black</br>     Angus. Oh my God, beautiful meat. I love meat. That reminds me of the meat.</br>     I can even have it medium like I like it. It's not that I really love to</br>     cook, but I have to cook because I want a little bit of over there.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What's the food that most reminds you of over there?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     American breakfast. It reminds me the most. American breakfast is the best.</br>     Sausages. I love sausages. When I had my first sausages with honey, it's</br>     like meat and sweet, but that taste in your mouth, it takes you to some</br>     other place. Like, this is good. It's like the American breakfast with</br>     sausages and bacon. I used to put a lot of honey syrup. It's like, &quot;This is</br>     great. Let me have another one.&quot; Or I used to stop by in the mornings.</br>     That's one of the things that really reminds me, because the morning there,</br>     everybody's awake early and there's a lot of places already open for you to</br>     have this good American breakfast. It reminds me a lot because you go</br>     there, and I have my hash browns, bacon, my big orange juice and coffee,</br>     American coffee. Here, well it's very tough to decide. There's nothing like</br>     over there. It reminds me a lot.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Remind me finally, where did you learn your English?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I learned English in California.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad</br>     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was</br>     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody</br>     was like, &quot;The new guy&quot; but I didn't know what they were talking about. And</br>     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL</br>     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I</br>     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had</br>     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that</br>     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was</br>     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class</br>     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling</br>     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts</br>     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. &quot;Huh?</br>     Okay.&quot; You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Okay. I heard about him.&quot;</br>     But then the language, I just heard the teacher going, &quot;Blah, blah, blah,</br>     blah, blah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay and I understood “Abraham Lincoln,” and that’s all. &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot;</br>     &quot;Good. What about him?&quot; Yes. It was difficult. Math? I didn't talk at all.</br>     I was good at math because I learned –here in Mexico, they're very good at</br>     math and still they are very good at math. My algebra teacher – It was a</br>     Chicano girl. I remember that Chicano girl. The teacher pointed at me for</br>     something and then the girl told me, &quot;Hey he's calling you. The teacher is</br>     calling you.&quot; She said that in Spanish. &quot;Mm-hmm. What you want me to do?</br>     What does he want me to do?&quot; &quot;He wants you to go to the board and complete</br>     the mathematic there.”</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Just go try to do it.&quot; She actually translated for the teacher, so I just</br>     went in without talking. I just finished the equation. It was an equation.</br>     The teacher was like, &quot;How do you do it? You got to show me how you do it.</br>     How'd you get that result?&quot; When he looked at me with those surprised eyes</br>     I was like, &quot;Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call</br>     my parents.&quot; Then the girl says, the translator said, &quot;How do you do it?&quot;</br>     &quot;Because that's how I learned to do it.&quot; &quot;Where do you learn to do it? He's</br>     asking where you-&quot; &quot;Mexico.&quot; &quot;He wants you to teach him how you did that.&quot;</br>     &quot;Well, this, this goes like this and you go like that&quot;. &quot;But how come you</br>     don't put anything on the board? How come you don't write anything? How</br>     come you just put the answer?&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Because in Mexico you just got to do the math in your head. My teachers</br>     will get mad if I do the math on the board. They don't like you to do</br>     that.&quot; Here, now this is different from my times. If you do a subtraction,</br>     you just do this subtraction. That's it. If you are going to do division,</br>     you just put the answer in and put the few steps down there. You don't do</br>     the minus thingy on the bottom and continue with the big line on the</br>     bottom. No, you just do the equation and that's it. My teacher was like,</br>     &quot;Okay, I'll teach you guys more. This guy is crazy.&quot; I remember when he</br>     called me crazy, &quot;This guy is crazy, how come he did this? I'll show you</br>     guys how to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he impressed?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [42:45] He was impressed. He was impressed. When he taught them how to do</br>     the equations, I already knew how to do them, and when he taught them how</br>     to do the geometrical, that's how you call them, the geometrical, Pi and</br>     try to get the– He drew a circle and, in the circle, just to get the</br>     equation for you to, on the circle, make a pentagon, things like that. I</br>     already knew how to do those in my head. &quot;You already knew?&quot; &quot;Yes. That's</br>     what I learned here in Mexico.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he surprised that a Mexican knew that?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes, very surprised. He was very surprised, and he wanted to know how, and</br>     I showed him how. He used to-</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he respectful at all?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. Yes. He was. I remember one time he got me, it was like</br>     [unintelligible 44:03], I mean they had this ticket for breakfast at that</br>     time when you go pick up your breakfast and he's like, &quot;Here, I'll give you</br>     an extra for you to take another breakfast tomorrow in the morning or</br>     lunch.&quot; &quot;Thank you, teacher.&quot; I was just learning. &quot;How come you got all</br>     this?&quot; &quot;Because I learned it in Mexico.&quot; &quot;They know more than us?” I don't</br>     know, but here in Mexico I learned the hard way. Teachers were very tough</br>     at that time. I had teachers that they actually pulled your hair if you</br>     didn't bring your homework at that time. That's the teachers I had. When I</br>     got there it was like, mathematics was like-</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Abraham Lincoln?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, no, I didn't know who that was. I knew he was in in Washington sitting</br>     down right there in a big sculpture. That's all. It's like, &quot;Abraham</br>     Lincoln. Something about the Constitution.&quot; The Constitution? No, I don't</br>     know what it is.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But you learned.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I learned, yes. They used to put us, those cartoons for politics, I</br>     remember I don't know how else to call it. I remember that with cartoons</br>     they used to tell you about the amendments, the Constitution, who Abraham</br>     Lincoln was. I didn't understand them. After a while, I just started</br>     comprehending English and learning. But it was very difficult.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Did you recite the Pledge of Allegiance?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. Yes, I did. I didn't know it, I was just [mumbling 00:46:07] didn't</br>     know. But then I learned it. I remember we used to do the Pledge of</br>     Allegiance, it was every morning, every morning. After that, I don't know</br>     what happened to schools. They stopped doing it, but it was every day. I</br>     used to do it every day. The Pledge of Allegiance. I even learned the</br>     American anthem, but all of a sudden everything started changing. I really</br>     don't know why. Times change. Things change. It reminds me a lot when I</br>     used to ride my bicycle to school, put the lock on it. I felt like in the</br>     movies. When I was little, I felt like I was in the movies, because of me</br>     on a bicycle, putting my bicycle and locking it. I felt like the Back to</br>     the Future guy, and I always wanted some Nikes like this guy. It was</br>     difficult for the language. It was difficult for the culture because it got</br>     me mixed up with the American culture and Chicano culture. There was a big</br>     division there because I had to learn from both.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     That's when you get like a Chicano burrito, Americans potato, mashed</br>     potatoes in this. Then, okay, Chicano goes to LA Dodgers stadium, and he's</br>     American. Cinco de Mayo, he's Mexican. What's going on? It's like, what's</br>     going on with this guy? But then American culture, [sings] “take me out to</br>     the ballgame.” I asked my mom a lot of stuff. I asked my dad a lot of</br>     stuff, and I believe I mentioned when you asked me how I felt, American or</br>     Mexican? That's what they taught me. &quot;You're Mexican. You're Mexican, you</br>     know the pyramids. You been there, you studied there. You remember this?&quot;</br>     &quot;Yes.&quot; Okay. Then you're Mexican. You're not American, but you're learning</br>     the American culture. Okay? Chicano, it's different. Way, totally,</br>     completely out of, don't pay attention. Yes. Pay attention. But don't go</br>     too much into it. You're Mexican.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     <span id="360aa2b7-bbc4-4981-a42b-8c2b9836757c" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Gangs, Tattoos">Anita:<br>

     related things and country stuff, and they wanted us to be part of them.<br>
     Whenever an American would say something or do something, we're together,<br>

     know what, I'm going through this struggle at school, these difficulties&quot;<br>

     they wanted me to become a gang member? Did you know all this?&quot; &quot;No. How<br>
     come you didn't tell me?&quot; &quot;Because I was afraid of you knowing that I was<br>
     having this problem because I knew you weren't going to do nothing. You,<br>

     I resisted because I really didn't like it. Because of the culture here in<br>
     Mexico, you don't fight for a street. Don't fight for a street. We fight, I<br>
     mean we have this argument, because you took maybe something off me but not<br>
     because of a street. We know it's stupid. We're like, &quot;Oh, that's your<br>

     stuff, and I believe I mentioned when you asked me how I felt, American or<br>
     Mexican? That's what they taught me. &quot;You're Mexican. You're Mexican, you<br>
     know the pyramids. You been there, you studied there. You remember this?&quot;<br>
     &quot;Yes.&quot; Okay. Then you're Mexican. You're not American, but you're learning<br>
     the American culture. Okay? Chicano, it's different. Way, totally,<br>

 <br>
 <br>
     Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     How?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad<br>
     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was<br>
     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody<br>
     was like, &quot;The new guy&quot; but I didn't know what they were talking about. And<br>
     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL<br>
     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I<br>
     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had<br>
     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that<br>
     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was<br>
     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class<br>
     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling<br>
     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts<br>
     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. &quot;Huh?<br>
     Okay.&quot; You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Okay. I heard about him.&quot;<br>
     But then the language, I just heard the teacher going, &quot;Blah, blah, blah,<br>
     blah, blah.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Okay and I understood “Abraham Lincoln,” and that’s all. &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Good. What about him?&quot; Yes. It was difficult. Math? I didn't talk at all.<br>
     I was good at math because I learned –here in Mexico, they're very good at<br>
     math and still they are very good at math. My algebra teacher – It was a<br>
     Chicano girl. I remember that Chicano girl. The teacher pointed at me for<br>
     something and then the girl told me, &quot;Hey he's calling you. The teacher is<br>
     calling you.&quot; She said that in Spanish. &quot;Mm-hmm. What you want me to do?<br>
     What does he want me to do?&quot; &quot;He wants you to go to the board and complete<br>
     the mathematic there.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     &quot;Just go try to do it.&quot; She actually translated for the teacher, so I just<br>
     went in without talking. I just finished the equation. It was an equation.<br>
     The teacher was like, &quot;How do you do it? You got to show me how you do it.<br>
     How'd you get that result?&quot; When he looked at me with those surprised eyes<br>
     I was like, &quot;Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call<br>
     my parents.&quot; Then the girl says, the translator said, &quot;How do you do it?&quot;<br>
     &quot;Because that's how I learned to do it.&quot; &quot;Where do you learn to do it? He's<br>
     asking where you-&quot; &quot;Mexico.&quot; &quot;He wants you to teach him how you did that.&quot;<br>
     &quot;Well, this, this goes like this and you go like that&quot;. &quot;But how come you<br>
     don't put anything on the board? How come you don't write anything? How<br>
     come you just put the answer?&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     Beto:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
     &quot;Because in Mexico you just got to do the math in your head. My teachers<br>
     will get mad if I do the math on the board. They don't like you to do<br>
     that.&quot; Here, now this is different from my times. If you do a subtraction,<br>
     you just do this subtraction. That's it. If you are going to do division,<br>
     you just put the answer in and put the few steps down there. You don't do<br>
     the minus thingy on the bottom and continue with the big line on the<br>
     bottom. No, you just do the equation and that's it. My teacher was like,<br>
     &quot;Okay, I'll teach you guys more. This guy is crazy.&quot; I remember when he<br>
     called me crazy, &quot;This guy is crazy, how come he did this? I'll show you<br>
     guys how to do this.&quot;<br>

     I know why Starbucks puts your name on the little thing because by putting<br>
     your name, it's like you are part of this place. They make you feel like<br>
     you are part of that specific restaurant. Not like what you see in the<br>
     movies. But I had a lot of restaurants where I used to go in, and they were<br>
     all my friends and they told me here, &quot;Why don't you change your name when<br>
     you, when you make- &quot; &quot;I don't have to, everybody knows Beto.&quot;<br>

     work and the view is beautiful. There's a lot of places that are beautiful.<br>
     I haven't had a chance to travel here. But the food, the American stuff,<br>
     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American<br>
     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a<br>
     coffee, it’s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.<br>
     &quot;Hey Beto.&quot; &quot;Hey my friend. Same?&quot; It was amazing. Something that we don't<br>
     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat<br>

     They stick with you and we learn from them because we actually don't know<br>
     where a place is. &quot;Hey, we want to try another thing&quot; especially food or<br>
     restaurants or maybe a bar. &quot; Oh, you've never been to this place?&quot; &quot;We<br>
     don't even know where it is,” “Let's go.&quot; We learn from them too. &quot;Oh this<br>
     is a nice one, I've never been here.&quot; We actually get together, and they<br>
     learn, we learn, and at the end we become very good friends and that's when<br>
     we become the network. &quot;Get over here, what are you're doing there? You're<br>

     because this is what happens when they learn English, they get to learn the<br>
     culture. They get to learn the American culture by all these games, by<br>
     watching the movies. We can have a conversation. If someone here does not<br>
     have the same ideas, we don't actually have this problem. Some of them ask<br>
     us, &quot;Hey, you've been in the States, how is this? How is that? You've been<br>
     to Disneyland?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Mickey mouse is big?&quot; But that's simple stuff. They<br>
     don't ask much. I'll give you another example. I had a friend that didn't<br>
     know, &quot;Hey, what is a money order?&quot; &quot;That's like a voucher. We don't have<br>
     these here.&quot; “Oh, that's a money order.”<br>

     because they're getting money, and they're learning English. That's the<br>
     25%. Some of them, because they're in school, they learned it maybe by<br>
     playing games. When we're in training and we have to actually introduce<br>
     ourselves, I'm amazed that they learned English playing games online or by<br>
     watching movies. I was like, it took me a lot in the States to learn<br>
     English because I was just listening to English. But it took me a little<br>
     while and they're just like, &quot;Oh I learned it by watching, I don't know,<br>
     Finding Nemo and Toy Story.” I'm laughing at all of it, &quot;Yeah you did.<br>
     Yes.&quot; We've had this guy introducing himself, he actually knew the Toy<br>
     Story song and I was like, &quot;Yes, you did learn English with Toy Story.&quot;<br>
     That's the 25%. Some of them, they do need it because they're actually in<br>
     school here, they study they're actually just trying to keep on learning<br>
     and move on.<br>

     about the call centers, the things I’ve done, the accounts. I've been to a<br>
     MasterCard, Kohls, I've even sold packages for cable TV, all those things.<br>
     You get to learn too. That's one of the advantages because you're learning<br>
     too, because you're managing money, people's money, you actually get to<br>
     know. I mean, on my end, that's what I've learned. I don't talk bad about<br>
     the call centers. I learned a lot. I never, well, in the States I never had<br>
     a credit card due to the fact that I was an illegal immigrant. But here I<br>
     have been managing people's credit cards, and it's like, &quot;Oh, I didn't know<br>
     about this.&quot; I mean, right now I'm in a call center where you lease phones.<br>
     I was surprised about leasing phones. I never heard about leasing phones. I<br>
     heard about leasing TVs, leasing cars, but phones?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
    </span> Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right now, I'm leasing the phones and have to explain to them that they're</br>     not financing the phones. I learned other stuff, like when you finance, and</br>     you rent is a completely different thing. You’re learning a lot. you really</br>     get to learn a lot about call centers.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     When you call up these call centers or customer service and you end up at a</br>     call center, people know so much. With all this movement, how do you master</br>     everything you need to know to be able to offer that service?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay, well actually, at every call center... It's amazing when you go in</br>     and apply at a different call center. Because the first time I got to a</br>     call center, it was difficult for me when the company moved. For me, moving</br>     to another one is like, &quot;What am I going to do? I just know how to manage</br>     this system.&quot; But it’s amazing that most of the call centers have a similar</br>     system. They manage a similar system. I mean they all go and manage this</br>     system called <span id="cb243cfd-02a6-4eaf-a03d-b62a85943fbb" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Call Centers, Learning English,  Adapting">Abay</span><span id="64484d40-9629-411a-a303-cf7c7e730403" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs/employment/work, Occupation, Call Centers">I'm pretty sure the call centers are doing their best to help us out, but I<br>
     don't know. It is very difficult. You're actually waiting to see what's<br>
     going to happen. Every time you go to a call center, you wait to see what's<br>
     going to happen next. Okay, I'm here right now. This is a good account. I'm<br>
     getting my money, but what if it moves? For us it's difficult because, as<br>
     being in this business, I think it is a business, I got to invest my time<br>
     and I’ve got to save money because I don't know what's going to happen<br>
     next. That's why I've been in so many call centers here.<br>

I have nothing to say bad about call<br>
     centers because basically you're in the process of making money. Right? But<br>
     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end<br>
     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,<br>
     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all<br>
     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small<br>
     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that<br>
     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try<br>
     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff<br>
     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down<br>
     to eat. That's when I was like, &quot;Okay, what am I doing here? They're making<br>
     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.&quot;<br>
     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're<br>
     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is<br>
     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two<br>
     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back<br>
     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
    </span> Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general</br>     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I</br>     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the</br>     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or</br>     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]</br>     again. You go back to [_____], you go back to start at where you started</br>     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a</br>     regular agent. I mean I don't have any problems, such as if I become a</br>     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much</br>     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's</br>     the way I see it. After that, you hit the wall. You don't actually get to</br>     move forward.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I'm pretty sure the call centers are doing their best to help us out, but I</br>     don't know. It is very difficult. You're actually waiting to see what's</br>     going to happen. Every time you go to a call center, you wait to see what's</br>     going to happen next.

For me, moving</br>     to another one is like, &quot;What am I going to do? I just know how to manage</br>     this system.&quot; But it’s amazing that most of the call centers have a similar</br>     system. They manage a similar system. I mean they all go and manage this</br>     system called Abaya, which is the one that you get to answer the phones.</br>     Most companies have the Abaya. I really don't know why, but all of them are</br>     similar. Okay?</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     After that, most of the steps that you follow are the same. Even though</br>     they're different products, the steps are very similar. You don't get</br>     really trapped in like what am I going to do next? No, it's very similar</br>     and they actually give you a very good training and you get to know, “I</br>     used to do this at this call center.” I used to manage, for example,</br>     setting up a credit card to make a payment. Most of the systems are the</br>     same. It's like, okay, I know how to do this. Most of the accounts you get</br>     the personal information about the customer, so you have to get the</br>     customer's information. You know that you have to set it up on tabs and all</br>     the squares but it's very similar.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But dealing with Kohls, are we talking about the clothing? Dealing with</br>     customers calling about Kohls and dealing with customers calling about</br>     leasing a phone is a completely different product.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. Different products, same process.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How do you learn about the product? Don't you have to know about the</br>     product?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes, they teach you about each product and how it works. The similar thing</br>     is at every call center you must ask for personal information. After that</br>     then it goes to product, which is not difficult. It's just the process that</br>     – in this case, for example, Kohls, clothing product. They teach you. You</br>     don't have to learn about each and every clothing. No, it's numbers. All of</br>     the clothes go by certain numbers that you'd have to click in. It's called</br>     S-K-Us, right? Here in the phone industry, we manage the phones, but it's</br>     the same at Kohls because you're not managing clothing, but you manage a</br>     number. Okay? You click on the number and the basic number pulls out the</br>     brand of the phone. I know on our end Samsung Galaxy or an iPhone is called</br>     iPhone or Samsung, but in this industry it's a number. That's why you don't</br>     really get to move like, okay, I need to learn woman's miniskirts or a</br>     woman's bra or a bunch of phones. Like, &quot;What am I going to do?&quot; I mean</br>     it's been a long time. “Nokia? Somebody is asking me for a Nokia? They're</br>     gone.” But yes, you just put on the number and it's amazing. “Nokia It's</br>     been a long time since I've seen you. I had you once, and you fell down,</br>     but you never die.”</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Is it boring?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Sometimes it is. It is something that is very routine. It's a routine.</br>     Especially when you're back-to-back, when you have one call after another,</br>     then it is boring. Even the call centers try to help you out with certain</br>     days, like, &quot;Okay, we'll take you out for, I don't know, a little</br>     breakfast.&quot; Still, you're going back to the call. It is boring sometimes.</br>     It's very stressful. Managing people, customer service, face to face or on</br>     the phone, is difficult. Dealing with people is, I'm not going to say the</br>     worst because we have to deal with people, but it is very, very difficult.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You're dealing with angry people.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I deal with very angry people. Yes. I have to breathe. I put myself on a</br>     little mute. I listen to everything they got to say. Sometimes they tell</br>     me, I mean what customers tell me is like, &quot;I'm not angry about you, I'm</br>     angry about the product. I'm angry about the company.&quot; But I have to take</br>     it because I'm still the company, right? At the end, you're the company and</br>     you work for this company. You’ve got to talk good about the company that</br>     you work for everywhere you go. You have to go back and say, &quot;Yes ma'am,</br>     let's go ahead and verify what the issue is, and I'd be more than glad to</br>     help you out with whatever. Let me exhaust my help. Let me see the most I</br>     can do for you. Even if I have to talk to my supervisor and you need to</br>     talk to him, but it has to be fixed.&quot; That's how it is.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You also told me yesterday about the ways in which you have this kind of</br>     network of people who all moved, spread news.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. At a call center you turn out to be friends with everybody. For</br>     example, I left a lot of friends at some other call centers. If I move on</br>     for better pay, we just move to another call center and verify if they</br>     actually pay good. I have friends that we manage to, we actually call each</br>     other, &quot;You know what? I'm here at this call center. They're paying, I</br>     don't know, 3,500 3,200 why don't you come over?&quot; That’s like, &quot;Okay wait,</br>     but don't come yet. Let me just get my first paycheck, and I'll let you</br>     know if it's true.&quot; So it’s like, &quot;Okay, let me know.&quot; I have to wait. I’ve</br>     even waited 15 days or if he just got in, for example, on the 5th of a</br>     specific month, I have to wait because they don't get paid exactly on the</br>     15th. They would probably get paid on the 31st, and I’d have to wait a</br>     whole month waiting for him to show me his paycheck.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;You know what? Yes, it is true. They're paying this much.&quot; Then I have to</br>     go, &quot;Hey sir, I've got to go.&quot; &quot;Why are you going? Why are you leaving?&quot;</br>     &quot;Well, I found a better place.&quot; Most likely they don't retain you, they</br>     don't try to keep you because this is a very rotating place. You rotate</br>     time to time. That's how we communicate through this networking as you call</br>     it. &quot;I'm here, I'm at TeleTech, come here, there's a brand-new account and</br>     they're going to be paying good.&quot; That's how we travel around.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Let's say you’re in TeleTech or you're in one place and some place opens</br>     and it's a new account that pays better. What happens to the old account?</br>     Everybody leaves and then what?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Most likely everybody leaves. It's like somebody is crying wolf. &quot;Let's</br>     go,&quot; and eventually they all leave. I mean they say, &quot;I'm sorry&quot; but I</br>     don't know what exactly happens. I've seen companies that, for example,</br>     there was a brand-new place, an AT&amp;amp;T. As soon as they opened, everybody</br>     took off. The call center got empty.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     The other call center?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     The other call center was empty. They started setting up advertisements</br>     everywhere. &quot;Hey, we need people, we need people.&quot; But that's how it is.</br>     That's basically what we want is really, we're trying to get a place with</br>     stability and a good pay.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Do the other call centers raise their pay?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Not the call center, there are accounts that pay good.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But the ones that lose when everybody runs off to AT&amp;amp;T and leaves their</br>     other jobs. Do the other call centers sometimes increase their pay to</br>     retain?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No. No. I guess we talk about it. You asked me about what happens to the</br>     new immigrants that come here. They're the ones that come on to take our</br>     place because they don't know what's going on. They just, &quot;Oh, a call</br>     center. I'm going to get 2000 pesos, I don't know, every two weeks.&quot; It's</br>     good because they are new immigrants. Even if we know about it, and they</br>     become our friends for a little while before we move on to the other call</br>     center. We let them know, &quot;You know what? Why don't you come with us?&quot; But</br>     they're afraid. &quot;No, I need to get experience.&quot; As soon as they get</br>     experience, &quot;What was I thinking? What happened in my head that I was stuck</br>     right here?&quot; That's what they do, and then they call us up. &quot;Hey, do you</br>     think they're still hiring?&quot; &quot;Yes. Come over.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Roughly what percentage of the people in the call centers lived in the</br>     States, and what percentage are Mexican would you say?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay, I will tell you in my head that 25% are from Mexico, 75% are</br>     immigrants. People nowadays, from here, start learning English. It is</br>     becoming very popular to learn English. I've seen people from here that</br>     don't need to work. They actually just try to improve their English, and</br>     they get into a call center.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     As a way of improving their English?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Exactly. Not to get money. Well, they actually are taking advantage of it</br>     because they're getting money, and they're learning English. That's the</br>     25%. Some of them, because they're in school, they learned it maybe by</br>     playing games. When we're in training and we have to actually introduce</br>     ourselves, I'm amazed that they learned English playing games online or by</br>     watching movies. I was like, it took me a lot in the States to learn</br>     English because I was just listening to English. But it took me a little</br>     while and they're just like, &quot;Oh I learned it by watching, I don't know,</br>     Finding Nemo and Toy Story.” I'm laughing at all of it, &quot;Yeah you did.</br>     Yes.&quot; We've had this guy introducing himself, he actually knew the Toy</br>     Story song and I was like, &quot;Yes, you did learn English with Toy Story.&quot;</br>     That's the 25%. Some of them, they do need it because they're actually in</br>     school here, they study they're actually just trying to keep on learning</br>     and move on.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What's the relationship between the two groups? Is there like a solidarity</br>     between the returning immigrants and then the Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     We're together. We're actually together. We become very good friends</br>     because this is what happens when they learn English, they get to learn the</br>     culture. They get to learn the American culture by all these games, by</br>     watching the movies. We can have a conversation. If someone here does not</br>     have the same ideas, we don't actually have this problem. Some of them ask</br>     us, &quot;Hey, you've been in the States, how is this? How is that? You've been</br>     to Disneyland?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Mickey mouse is big?&quot; But that's simple stuff. They</br>     don't ask much. I'll give you another example. I had a friend that didn't</br>     know, &quot;Hey, what is a money order?&quot; &quot;That's like a voucher. We don't have</br>     these here.&quot; “Oh, that's a money order.”</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     A money order?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     A money order. Yes. &quot;I don't know what's a money order.&quot; &quot;Okay. That's a</br>     voucher. You go to the liquor store, you go to the store, you ask for</br>     certain amount and then they put some numbers, and that's money.&quot; &quot;Really?</br>     How come we don't have this here?&quot; &quot;Here I don't think that’s going to be a</br>     good idea.&quot; They don't know those things because they've never been there.</br>     But that's certain little things.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     That's really interesting because a lot of other people talk about the</br>     discrimination that they face here for speaking English.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     It looks like things are a little different in a call center. It's like an</br>     oasis maybe.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. Because they get involved with us. They want to know. They are a</br>     very curious people that already learned or are trying to learn the</br>     language. “We're planning to go to Olive Garden, we're planning to go to</br>     Chili's, but that's very expensive. But, I mean, we like Chili's. We want</br>     to go Olive Garden. Let's go.” Just for being curious, they learn. There</br>     are a lot of Olive Gardens. We have Wendy's here in Reforma. We’ve been</br>     there and they're surprised, like, &quot;Is this in the States?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is in</br>     the States.&quot; Beautiful burgers, so you want to try them out. That's</br>     basically what, we don't have this discrimination in between people who</br>     want to learn the culture and the stores because most people here are not</br>     very curious about it. Most of them, I should say. There's very few people</br>     that learn.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     This is a sort of mini little group who are actually interested.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. College guys, university guys. Here we have a name for the guys that</br>     just live with their parents and they don't work. We call them Ninis</br>     [00:26:06]. They also are the ones that learn English a lot because they</br>     don't do anything at home but watch movies, play games. But they're very</br>     curious. They get to be very curious too.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     They don't discriminate against you.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, not really. No. They actually want to know more. They stick with you.</br>     They stick with you and we learn from them because we actually don't know</br>     where a place is. &quot;Hey, we want to try another thing&quot; especially food or</br>     restaurants or maybe a bar. &quot; Oh, you've never been to this place?&quot; &quot;We</br>     don't even know where it is,” “Let's go.&quot; We learn from them too. &quot;Oh this</br>     is a nice one, I've never been here.&quot; We actually get together, and they</br>     learn, we learn, and at the end we become very good friends and that's when</br>     we become the network. &quot;Get over here, what are you're doing there? You're</br>     getting little money. Come with us. Here's better now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     That's fascinating. To go back to something else, I asked you what you</br>     missed from the United States. Let me ask you that again. You said you</br>     missed the tastes. Can you expand on that?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I miss the taste. I miss the relaxation, everything that's around in the</br>     States. It's very –you don't stress that much. I used to travel around at</br>     work and the view is beautiful. There's a lot of places that are beautiful.</br>     I haven't had a chance to travel here. But the food, the American stuff,</br>     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American</br>     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a</br>     coffee, it’s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.</br>     &quot;Hey Beto.&quot; &quot;Hey my friend. Same?&quot; It was amazing. Something that we don't</br>     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat</br>     you, it's beautiful.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What do you mean the way they treat you?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Like they always smile at you. They actually say good morning, good</br>     afternoon. I never had a bad experience at a restaurant. Most likely, in a</br>     public area, never had a bad experience.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     When you went in there, he remembered your order.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. They remember my order. It was amazing because they got me there. Now</br>     I know why Starbucks puts your name on the little thing because by putting</br>     your name, it's like you are part of this place. They make you feel like</br>     you are part of that specific restaurant. Not like what you see in the</br>     movies. But I had a lot of restaurants where I used to go in, and they were</br>     all my friends and they told me here, &quot;Why don't you change your name when</br>     you, when you make- &quot; &quot;I don't have to, everybody knows Beto.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I go, they know Beto everywhere. Every time it's like, &quot;Beto, hey Beto,</br>     amigo, same?&quot; &quot;Yes. But now make a little bit more toasty.&quot; It is</br>     beautiful. I mean I got the taste of American food and all of the areas. I</br>     even went to Chinese places. There's a lot of people there. I mean I never</br>     had a bad experience. It was good.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     The last thing is, tell me this lasagna story again.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Oh, the lasagna.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Then I'll let you go.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [31:47] Okay, well we're talking about discrimination in this case. I was</br>     just cooking lasagna and my family told me, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;I'm</br>     cooking a lasagna. You guys want some?&quot; This was a beautiful lasagna in a</br>     crystal base. They told me, &quot;Why don't you cook something Mexican? You're</br>     in Mexico.&quot; &quot;What do you want me to cook, beans?&quot; &quot;Some beans, I don't</br>     know, something Mexican.&quot; &quot;But I love lasagna. You guys want to have some</br>     lasagna?&quot; &quot;No, it looks nasty. No.&quot; This is one of the things that you</br>     encounter when you're here that we're talking about people that are trying</br>     to learn and people who don’t want to know what's going on. It's like,</br>     &quot;Taste lasagna. Have a little taste?&quot; &quot;No but it looks nasty.&quot; &quot;It's just</br>     pasta there and then tomato. Take a little taste.&quot; &quot;No, I’ll just go back</br>     to my kitchen and have some beans and chicharron and all this Mexican</br>     food.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I mean, I like it, but I also like to have something from over there or</br>     what I used to eat over there. I brought my microwave. I'm living like I’m</br>     in the States. I mean I try to make my living like in the States: nice and</br>     easy. When I met my wife, I had all my stuff, my cooking stuff. She was</br>     like, &quot;What is this?&quot; I have my [inaudible 00:34:04] I don't know like</br>     heat, not the microwave. The other one.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     A toaster oven?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Toaster oven, yes. &quot;Why is that? What's that for?&quot; &quot;Well, I cook lasagna,</br>     and I make potatoes with cheese and I put a lot of stuff on it and I cook</br>     there.&quot; &quot;I didn't know you cook.&quot; &quot;Yes, I do.” Sometimes I don't like to</br>     eat a lot of greasy stuff from here. I do want something else. I want</br>     something that can remind me of the States. That's true. I cook. I also</br>     make, for myself, big pieces of meat, and I cook them there. Yes. It's</br>     like, &quot;Why are you like that?&quot; Because I used to go to restaurants, Black</br>     Angus. Oh my God, beautiful meat. I love meat. That reminds me of the meat.</br>     I can even have it medium like I like it. It's not that I really love to</br>     cook, but I have to cook because I want a little bit of over there.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What's the food that most reminds you of over there?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     American breakfast. It reminds me the most. American breakfast is the best.</br>     Sausages. I love sausages. When I had my first sausages with honey, it's</br>     like meat and sweet, but that taste in your mouth, it takes you to some</br>     other place. Like, this is good. It's like the American breakfast with</br>     sausages and bacon. I used to put a lot of honey syrup. It's like, &quot;This is</br>     great. Let me have another one.&quot; Or I used to stop by in the mornings.</br>     That's one of the things that really reminds me, because the morning there,</br>     everybody's awake early and there's a lot of places already open for you to</br>     have this good American breakfast. It reminds me a lot because you go</br>     there, and I have my hash browns, bacon, my big orange juice and coffee,</br>     American coffee. Here, well it's very tough to decide. There's nothing like</br>     over there. It reminds me a lot.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Remind me finally, where did you learn your English?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I learned English in California.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad</br>     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was</br>     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody</br>     was like, &quot;The new guy&quot; but I didn't know what they were talking about. And</br>     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL</br>     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I</br>     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had</br>     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that</br>     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was</br>     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class</br>     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling</br>     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts</br>     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. &quot;Huh?</br>     Okay.&quot; You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Okay. I heard about him.&quot;</br>     But then the language, I just heard the teacher going, &quot;Blah, blah, blah,</br>     blah, blah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Okay and I understood “Abraham Lincoln,” and that’s all. &quot;Abraham Lincoln.&quot;</br>     &quot;Good. What about him?&quot; Yes. It was difficult. Math? I didn't talk at all.</br>     I was good at math because I learned –here in Mexico, they're very good at</br>     math and still they are very good at math. My algebra teacher – It was a</br>     Chicano girl. I remember that Chicano girl. The teacher pointed at me for</br>     something and then the girl told me, &quot;Hey he's calling you. The teacher is</br>     calling you.&quot; She said that in Spanish. &quot;Mm-hmm. What you want me to do?</br>     What does he want me to do?&quot; &quot;He wants you to go to the board and complete</br>     the mathematic there.”</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Just go try to do it.&quot; She actually translated for the teacher, so I just</br>     went in without talking. I just finished the equation. It was an equation.</br>     The teacher was like, &quot;How do you do it? You got to show me how you do it.</br>     How'd you get that result?&quot; When he looked at me with those surprised eyes</br>     I was like, &quot;Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call</br>     my parents.&quot; Then the girl says, the translator said, &quot;How do you do it?&quot;</br>     &quot;Because that's how I learned to do it.&quot; &quot;Where do you learn to do it? He's</br>     asking where you-&quot; &quot;Mexico.&quot; &quot;He wants you to teach him how you did that.&quot;</br>     &quot;Well, this, this goes like this and you go like that&quot;. &quot;But how come you</br>     don't put anything on the board? How come you don't write anything? How</br>     come you just put the answer?&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Because in Mexico you just got to do the math in your head. My teachers</br>     will get mad if I do the math on the board. They don't like you to do</br>     that.&quot; Here, now this is different from my times. If you do a subtraction,</br>     you just do this subtraction. That's it. If you are going to do division,</br>     you just put the answer in and put the few steps down there. You don't do</br>     the minus thingy on the bottom and continue with the big line on the</br>     bottom. No, you just do the equation and that's it. My teacher was like,</br>     &quot;Okay, I'll teach you guys more. This guy is crazy.&quot; I remember when he</br>     called me crazy, &quot;This guy is crazy, how come he did this? I'll show you</br>     guys how to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he impressed?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     [42:45] He was impressed. He was impressed. When he taught them how to do</br>     the equations, I already knew how to do them, and when he taught them how</br>     to do the geometrical, that's how you call them, the geometrical, Pi and</br>     try to get the– He drew a circle and, in the circle, just to get the</br>     equation for you to, on the circle, make a pentagon, things like that. I</br>     already knew how to do those in my head. &quot;You already knew?&quot; &quot;Yes. That's</br>     what I learned here in Mexico.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he surprised that a Mexican knew that?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes, very surprised. He was very surprised, and he wanted to know how, and</br>     I showed him how. He used to-</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Was he respectful at all?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. Yes. He was. I remember one time he got me, it was like</br>     [unintelligible 44:03], I mean they had this ticket for breakfast at that</br>     time when you go pick up your breakfast and he's like, &quot;Here, I'll give you</br>     an extra for you to take another breakfast tomorrow in the morning or</br>     lunch.&quot; &quot;Thank you, teacher.&quot; I was just learning. &quot;How come you got all</br>     this?&quot; &quot;Because I learned it in Mexico.&quot; &quot;They know more than us?” I don't</br>     know, but here in Mexico I learned the hard way. Teachers were very tough</br>     at that time. I had teachers that they actually pulled your hair if you</br>     didn't bring your homework at that time. That's the teachers I had. When I</br>     got there it was like, mathematics was like-</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Abraham Lincoln?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, no, I didn't know who that was. I knew he was in in Washington sitting</br>     down right there in a big sculpture. That's all. It's like, &quot;Abraham</br>     Lincoln. Something about the Constitution.&quot; The Constitution? No, I don't</br>     know what it is.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     But you learned.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I learned, yes. They used to put us, those cartoons for politics, I</br>     remember I don't know how else to call it. I remember that with cartoons</br>     they used to tell you about the amendments, the Constitution, who Abraham</br>     Lincoln was. I didn't understand them. After a while, I just started</br>     comprehending English and learning. But it was very difficult.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Did you recite the Pledge of Allegiance?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. Yes, I did. I didn't know it, I was just [mumbling 00:46:07] didn't</br>     know. But then I learned it. I remember we used to do the Pledge of</br>     Allegiance, it was every morning, every morning. After that, I don't know</br>     what happened to schools. They stopped doing it, but it was every day. I</br>     used to do it every day. The Pledge of Allegiance. I even learned the</br>     American anthem, but all of a sudden everything started changing. I really</br>     don't know why. Times change. Things change. It reminds me a lot when I</br>     used to ride my bicycle to school, put the lock on it. I felt like in the</br>     movies. When I was little, I felt like I was in the movies, because of me</br>     on a bicycle, putting my bicycle and locking it. I felt like the Back to</br>     the Future guy, and I always wanted some Nikes like this guy. It was</br>     difficult for the language. It was difficult for the culture because it got</br>     me mixed up with the American culture and Chicano culture. There was a big</br>     division there because I had to learn from both.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     That's when you get like a Chicano burrito, Americans potato, mashed</br>     potatoes in this. Then, okay, Chicano goes to LA Dodgers stadium, and he's</br>     American. Cinco de Mayo, he's Mexican. What's going on? It's like, what's</br>     going on with this guy? But then American culture, [sings] “take me out to</br>     the ballgame.” I asked my mom a lot of stuff. I asked my dad a lot of</br>     stuff, and I believe I mentioned when you asked me how I felt, American or</br>     Mexican? That's what they taught me. &quot;You're Mexican. You're Mexican, you</br>     know the pyramids. You been there, you studied there. You remember this?&quot;</br>     &quot;Yes.&quot; Okay. Then you're Mexican. You're not American, but you're learning</br>     the American culture. Okay? Chicano, it's different. Way, totally,</br>     completely out of, don't pay attention. Yes. Pay attention. But don't go</br>     too much into it. You're Mexican.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Were they worried that the Chicano's were sort of gang members-</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes. At that specific time, I remember I didn't know about the drive-by</br>     shootings because I've been, well we were afraid of those at that time and</br>     that's what they were trying to avoid. Since I had my childhood right here,</br>     which I remember too, I didn't like Chicano that much or the gang members</br>     at all. I don't have tattoos. When they, &quot;Oh I put on my new tattoo.&quot; I</br>     just gave them my like sign here. &quot;Good for you.&quot; Don't like tattoos. I</br>     just look at them and go, &quot;Good for you.&quot; But that's it.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You think that having your childhood here made a difference because you</br>     went later.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     A lot of the people we talked to who went as children became sort of street</br>     people. Because you went later you think it was different?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Right. I believe because of what we had before here in Mexico. We had a lot</br>     of pressure at school. I don't know, this new expression about bullying is</br>     brand new. Bullying. You didn't have this here in Mexico. There was no</br>     bullying. You just got out of the school, &quot;Okay, why are you doing this to</br>     me,&quot; and you fight. That's it. No words, no nothing, no bullying. It was</br>     like, &quot;I'm not fat. I'm not skinny. I'm not short.&quot; No. Teachers were very,</br>     very strict. Also, my cousins my age, we lived this experience with the</br>     teachers who were very strict. You don't do this, you don't do that. I</br>     remember them having my hands or my fingers together and they had a ruler,</br>     and they hit me if I didn't have the homework, if I was misbehaving.</br>     Teachers were very– you have to respect them at that time. When you go to a</br>     different country, and you had this Chicano culture that there, I mean, no</br>     respect. It was like, &quot;No, that's not what I learned.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Kids who are undocumented, boys who went to the States as very, very young</br>     children sometimes become part of gangs. You believe that because you went</br>     to Mexican school and you had a certain set of values, you went a different</br>     way.</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Exactly. Most people that I met in the States, we had these ESL classes. I</br>     should say that 70% lived here, and the values that you mentioned, the</br>     values were very, very settled. Not in the next 30%, the ones that maybe</br>     because of here they just were immigrants, and they were poor. I mean, I'm</br>     not saying that I was rich, I was poor too. But I mean they were having a</br>     hard time here in Mexico. Probably they were trying to find out what they</br>     were going to do with their lives. Even though we were kids, we knew like,</br>     &quot;I don't like this, this Chicano, this gang member thing.&quot; I was invited</br>     many times to join them because of discrimination with them. I never had</br>     this bad experience with an American telling me, &quot;You're a wetback.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, I had the bad experience with Chicanos telling me I'm a wetback, and I</br>     had a lot of fights there. I used to tell them, &quot;You know what? I'm a</br>     wetback, but guess what? I know what I am. I'm Mexican. You don't know what</br>     you are. You don't know. Tell me what you are, and I’ll respect you.&quot; That</br>     got me into a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble because that's what my mom</br>     told me. &quot;They don't know what they are. You know what you are. You're</br>     Mexican. They don't know.&quot; She taught me about it. “You know, they go to</br>     Dodger Stadium, they're Americans, hotdogs, beer, all this. Cinco de Mayo,</br>     they're Mexican. So tell me what they are.”</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     &quot;Do you ever go-&quot; &quot;Yes, I go to the Dodger Stadium.&quot; &quot;Okay. How do you</br>     feel?&quot; &quot;Good. A new thing. That's a new thing. That's an American culture</br>     thing.” “You joined them, right?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;But what are you?&quot; Mexican. You</br>     don't have to be wearing all these Dodgers thingys. Because I used to wear</br>     my regular clothes to a Dodger Stadium whenever. You don't go like wearing</br>     you cap and, &quot;Oh, I'm a Dodger fan.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Did you wear a Mexican Jersey?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No, it was regular. Yes.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Were you a soccer fan?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     A little bit, not much. I was more into American football when I was</br>     little. I just admire when they used to train at high school. I loved that.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Who was your team?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     At that moment, we had this team which was the LA Raiders. They were my</br>     actual team and the Rams. Yeah, but I don't know what happened. They moved</br>     to Oakland. We don't have no more, like, the LA team. It is in Oakland, but</br>     we don't get this feeling like, &quot;Oh my team.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Final question, did you have American friends too?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     No. Well, yes. A few of them, but I was in middle school. After high</br>     school, not many. It was all mixed up. Americans actually started moving</br>     when the Chicano movement was there, they started moving. High school I</br>     didn't have that much American friends.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Who were your friends?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Mexicans and black people. A lot of black people. I met a lot of black</br>     people.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     They accepted you?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     They had to.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     What do you mean?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     It was very tough because they wanted us to stick with them as, I don't</br>     know. Schools are like– they do have certain stuff going on with gang</br>     related things and country stuff, and they wanted us to be part of them.</br>     Whenever an American would say something or do something, we're together,</br>     but we actually said, &quot;No.&quot; We're good friends. But that's it.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     You had a strong home environment. Your mother and father were there?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     They were happy?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     They were happy because they didn't know what I was going through. I never</br>     told them my experiences at school because of the respect I have. I knew if</br>     I would tell them something that I was going through, because of Mexican</br>     culture before, they were very strict. I was afraid of telling them, &quot;You</br>     know what, I'm going through this struggle at school, these difficulties&quot;</br>     because my dad would tell me, &quot;You're just going to study. That's why</br>     you're going. You're just going to study. Don't pay attention to anything,</br>     and I don't want you to do anything stupid. You're to go to school and</br>     that's it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I knew his answer already. I knew what he was going to tell me, so I just</br>     decided just to continue with my stuff. Now that I'm older. We have this</br>     conversation. I had this conversation with him. &quot;Did you know about me</br>     having these difficulties with Chicanos, with black people? Did you know</br>     they wanted me to become a gang member? Did you know all this?&quot; &quot;No. How</br>     come you didn't tell me?&quot; &quot;Because I was afraid of you knowing that I was</br>     having this problem because I knew you weren't going to do nothing. You,</br>     you, you were not going to take me back to Mexico because we were already</br>     here.&quot; He's like, &quot;I didn't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     How did you resist becoming a gang member?</br> </br> </br>     Beto:</br> </br> </br>     I resisted because I really didn't like it. Because of the culture here in</br>     Mexico, you don't fight for a street. Don't fight for a street. We fight, I</br>     mean we have this argument, because you took maybe something off me but not</br>     because of a street. We know it's stupid. We're like, &quot;Oh, that's your</br>     street? You own it? Go for it.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It's your street? What about the</br>     street? That's good.</br> </br> </br>     Anita:</br> </br> </br>     Thank you so much.</br> </div><\p></p>
