        <div class="content">
            <p><p><br>
   Anita: Let’s begin by you telling me a little bit about migrating to the<br>
   United States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Migrating to the United States: okay. My parents had an extremely<br>
   bad divorce - very, very, very bad divorce. My dad's family is on the<br>
   wealthier side and a little bit on the powerful side, and my mom has no<br>
   money nor connections, and she's poor. When they were divorcing, by the end<br>
   of their marriage—I think it was the most awful marriage that I've seen—he<br>
   was threatening her with taking us away and completely … you know she would<br>
   never see us ever, so like a thief in the night, she grabbed my two sisters<br>
   and I and she moved us to the States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: My grandmother is an American citizen, and she's lived in the US on<br>
   and off for about 50 years. My grandmother's Texan at heart and never<br>
   learned English, but very, very Texan [Laughs]. My mother, she had to cross<br>
   the bad way. She went through the desert, she went through the river. My<br>
   sisters and I, we went through the bridge, like the regular crossing, but<br>
   we used other people's papers. My middle sister, they cut her hair off<br>
   completely, and I had to call her Jose.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: She had short, short hair. My sister's hair was up to her waist, and<br>
   my mom just shaved it off and her name was Jose now, and it was a game. I<br>
   didn't know what was happening, of course. We arrived to ____ California.<br>
   We arrived at an apartment that we were sharing with about eight other<br>
   people—my grandparents, my sisters and I, my mother, my uncles, then<br>
   eventually my uncle's wife. One of my uncles got the opportunity to move to<br>
   Chicago—a job opportunity—so he moved. I think after my parents divorced,<br>
   all of my uncles saw us as their kids, because two of the ones that really<br>
   took care of us never really had kids, so they loved us and they brought us<br>
   in.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: We moved to Chicago with my grandparents because my grandparents<br>
   were my second parents by this point. My mother is the eldest—she took care<br>
   of seven of my grandparents’ children, so my grandmother really, really<br>
   loves my mother. We moved to Chicago to an apartment on Green Bay on the<br>
   East Side, and that's how it went.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Let me ask you a few questions going backwards. Was there any<br>
   domestic abuse in your family?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: With my parents? My mother, yes. She doesn't like to talk about it.<br>
   The older I get, the more she opens up, but it's not something that she<br>
   likes to talk about. It was never in front of us, it was behind closed<br>
   doors. I thank my father. He's a piece of shit, but I thank him for at<br>
   least having the thought of not wanting to traumatize us. So yes, it was<br>
   behind closed doors, but the more I get out of my mom, it was a lot of<br>
   emotional abuse as well, a lot. I think there was some physical abuse. My<br>
   mom's never touched upon it, but that's what happened. And then we got to<br>
   Chicago.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Last time we spoke, you talked about how difficult it was to—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: To leave my dad?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: ... to leave things behind.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Of course. I grew up fairly wealthy in Mexico. I had a big, big<br>
   house. I had two German Shepherds that ran around everywhere. I had a<br>
   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.<br>
   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I<br>
   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go<br>
   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They<br>
   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side. I<br>
   would lay and sleep on my dad's chest always. Always, always, always,<br>
   always, always, so it was extremely difficult to leave my dad behind the<br>
   most. My dad was my world back then. But my dad, my friends, school—school<br>
   was great, I loved school [Chuckles]—I had to leave it all behind.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How old were you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: When I left, I was six years old.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: The apartment you moved into—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: The apartment that we moved into in California was a one-bedroom<br>
   apartment. It was a big complex and I remember it. There was a pool in the<br>
   middle and there were a lot of families like us that shared a one-bedroom<br>
   apartment. And there were eight to twelve people in this one space, and we<br>
   were trying to find something bigger, but it was impossible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you remember what your mood was like at that time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Jarring. It was extremely jarring. From one day to another, the move<br>
   was extremely … it was jarring. One day, you have a family and you're<br>
   happy, and then the next, you can't even speak the language. You can't<br>
   communicate, you don't know where you're at. I felt like my whole world was<br>
   tilted to the side.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How soon after getting to California did you move to Chicago?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Within three to six months. It didn't take that long … immediately<br>
   kind of. I think one of my uncles took it upon himself to take care of us,<br>
   and since my mom … my mom at the time, we did not know she had a tumor in<br>
   the back of her brain. Right where her brain stem is, she had a huge tumor<br>
   there and we had no idea. Nobody knew. She doesn't remember a lot of this.<br>
   I don't know if it's because of the emotional trauma or because of the<br>
   tumor, but once we got to Chicago, it was evident that something was wrong<br>
   with my mother and she started going to the doctor.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Thank God for Cook County Hospital [Chuckles]. They don't charge you<br>
   a thing, but she got the medical treatment that she needed. She had brain<br>
   surgery. They removed the tumor and she had to be in therapy for a few<br>
   years in order to gain … she couldn't talk. She didn't have movement in<br>
   half of her face, so she couldn't speak because her tongue was numb on one<br>
   side, so she had to have physical therapy. I went with her a couple times<br>
   because I had to translate. Sometimes they didn't have people who would<br>
   translate for my mother. At this point, I had already learned English, but<br>
   she had to practice every single day. Still to this day, there are a few<br>
   words that she cannot say.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: She can't pronounce them or she doesn't remember them?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: She can't pronounce them. She'll talk like this [imitates] because<br>
   she can't move half of her face.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was the tumor benign?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes, it was benign. Thank God for that. But she had an encounter<br>
   with TB and then she was on medication for that. You know what I think it<br>
   was? I think that all this negativity affected her [Chuckles], or I don't<br>
   know if you believe this, but the law of attraction. I think that she<br>
   really did not want to keep going and that affected her quite a bit.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: When did you start going to school, in Chicago or in LA?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I moved to Chicago and that's where I started going to school. I<br>
   started going to school at the age of six. Unfortunately, the school that I<br>
   went to did not have a bilingual program. I was stuck with Miss S.<br>
   [Chuckles]. I'm never going to forget her … Miss S., lovely woman<br>
   [Chuckles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Is that sarcastic?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes, [Chuckles] very sarcastic. Did not speak a lick of Spanish. Not<br>
   one sentence. I don't think she knew how to pronounce anything, and she was<br>
   as WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] as you can get. This woman would get<br>
   extremely frustrated with me—extremely—and I didn't know what was going on.<br>
   To me, it was a completely … [Disgusted sound] it was mind-boggling how I<br>
   could go from—I knew how to read and write in Spanish. I was a pretty smart<br>
   kid. I knew how to read and write in Spanish at six years old. So I go into<br>
   first grade and I can't even understand what my teachers are saying, so it<br>
   was extremely frustrating and this teacher found it extremely frustrating<br>
   as well, so she would lay me down face down half the day on the magic<br>
   carpet where she would read stories to everyone because she didn't want to<br>
   deal with it anymore. I told my mom—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Because she didn't want to deal with what?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Deal with me anymore. I guess she didn't know where to put me. She<br>
   didn't know what to do with me, she didn't know how to teach me, so her<br>
   solution was to put me aside and not have to deal with me, so I had to<br>
   pretty much be invisible for half the class. Just put my head down and not<br>
   say a word. So I picked up English extremely fast because I had to<br>
   [Chuckles]. I had to pick up English very, very, very fast or that was<br>
   going to keep happening. I didn't want that to keep happening, so I picked<br>
   it up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I told my mom about this and I remember vividly having a<br>
   conversation with her and telling her, "Hey, you know what? This is<br>
   happening at school," but I think my mom was going through so much stuff<br>
   that she didn't know how to deal with it or she didn't … there wasn't<br>
   enough of my mom to go around back then. I know now. I forgive her, but<br>
   certain things … [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.<br>
   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this<br>
   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her<br>
   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She<br>
   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She<br>
   started going to design school for designing clothes and it’s pretty great.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Let's talk about that in one second. If you were lying face down on<br>
   the magic carpet all day, how did you learn English?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I was there for half the day, and this is something that I'm going<br>
   to tell you that my teachers had told me in kindergarten. I could be<br>
   sitting down underneath the table and playing around, and they would be<br>
   teaching math and I could learn it. I'm an extremely fast learner—an<br>
   extremely fast learner. I think I picked it up by just listening to it, and<br>
   the few classes that I had, I picked it up. It was not that hard and I<br>
   think at that age it's easier to absorb information, but I think it was<br>
   mostly that I'm a quick learner.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did the kids tease you? Were they friendly to you? What was it like<br>
   in Miss S. class?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to<br>
   me, J___ and— what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good<br>
   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of<br>
   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher<br>
   was not having it … She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of<br>
   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some<br>
   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They<br>
   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a<br>
   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is<br>
   getting married soon, so yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Were you bullied?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: [Pause] Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied<br>
   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at<br>
   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a<br>
   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].<br>
   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was<br>
   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace<br>
   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school<br>
   that I had to go to was not a good school.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of<br>
   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up<br>
   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book<br>
   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the<br>
   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald<br>
   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,<br>
   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,<br>
   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as<br>
   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same<br>
   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the<br>
   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where<br>
   you would go and read.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: In eighth grade?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they<br>
   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy<br>
   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy<br>
   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more<br>
   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.<br>
   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the<br>
   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the<br>
   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a<br>
   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your<br>
   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill<br>
   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to<br>
   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was<br>
   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a<br>
   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it<br>
   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry<br>
   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with<br>
   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the<br>
   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I<br>
   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a<br>
   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading<br>
   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet<br>
   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the<br>
   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original<br>
   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's<br>
   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into<br>
   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a<br>
   huge reader [Chuckles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human<br>
   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,<br>
   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed<br>
   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have<br>
   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.<br>
   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.<br>
   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained<br>
   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black<br>
   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and<br>
   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,<br>
   historical fiction. I was into everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge<br>
   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, “are you above the<br>
   law? Is anybody above the law?” Yes, I was big on reading. I loved reading<br>
   [Chuckles]. Then absurdism. I'm big on reading [Chuckles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You told me last time about your—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Eighth grade teacher.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Tell me about it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Mr. R. is the best teacher I have had and he changed my life. Mr. R<br>
   is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. [Pause] I had a lot of<br>
   teachers that would not … They would question me and they would ... All the<br>
   stuff that I would write, they would question if I was okay mentally<br>
   because of all this darkness [Chuckles] that I would write about, because a<br>
   lot of my stories or a lot of my poetry was extremely dark. I don't think<br>
   that's a bad thing you know. I think that's just trying to get rid of the …<br>
   it's a catalyst. You're trying to get rid of everything that's inside of<br>
   you, and that's how I did it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Mr. R was the first one that recognized it as something good. We<br>
   still keep in touch—beautiful human being. I knew this. He would speak to<br>
   me like we were adults—like I was an adult. I was a thirteen-year-old girl<br>
   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was<br>
   or what he saw in me, but we had conversations like adults. I would stay<br>
   after class for hours just discussing books that he would give me, and he<br>
   would give me books out of his collection for me to read.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about<br>
   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He<br>
   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.<br>
   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccolò Machiavelli. I<br>
   actually have “the end justifies the means” tattooed on me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   It’s tattooed back here. Realism to me was … it's real. Human beings are<br>
   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will<br>
   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just<br>
   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,<br>
   if that makes sense.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: But yes, Mr. R was beautiful. He was a lawyer. He was a criminal<br>
   lawyer. I'm not sure what kind of lawyer he was, but he hated defending<br>
   people who were guilty. That man—oh my God I love that man—he hated it. He<br>
   hated defending people who were guilty. There's this program called the<br>
   “Golden Apple Program” where you can switch from being whatever it is that<br>
   your career is to being a teacher, and it's what he did. Beautiful,<br>
   beautiful man.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I<br>
   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I<br>
   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and<br>
   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about<br>
   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting. Yes, so Mr. R was<br>
   someone beautiful and he taught me that [Pause] life is short and you need<br>
   to seize the day. You need to take life by the balls [Chuckles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting<br>
   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because<br>
   reading transports you to different places and different languages and<br>
   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been<br>
   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,<br>
   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design<br>
   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, "You<br>
   know what? I'm going to be independent," so she moves aside. She starts her<br>
   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they<br>
   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to<br>
   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,<br>
   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the<br>
   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their<br>
   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three<br>
   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was<br>
   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was<br>
   great. I got to meet a lot of people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,<br>
   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the<br>
   attire?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would<br>
   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was<br>
   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with<br>
   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It<br>
   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],<br>
   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took<br>
   over.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he<br>
   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to<br>
   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would<br>
   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, "Oh, my God. What's<br>
   happening?" But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually<br>
   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,<br>
   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.<br>
   They were great people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Something you said yesterday that you said you didn't tell me about<br>
   was something about adoption.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting<br>
   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the<br>
   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not<br>
   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the<br>
   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be<br>
   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our<br>
   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for<br>
   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put<br>
   a huge stop to that and was like, "That's not happening. You're stupid.<br>
   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: It was going to be a family member, not a close family member, but<br>
   these were the lengths that you go through to try to get through this. I<br>
   didn't have a normal childhood. I never got to learn to drive. I didn't go<br>
   to drivers ed. I didn't get to travel with my best friend to DisneyLand<br>
   because my mom was so scared of—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more<br>
   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that<br>
   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave<br>
   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,<br>
   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone<br>
   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who<br>
   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad<br>
   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,<br>
   "Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”<br>
   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I<br>
   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The<br>
   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on<br>
   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with<br>
   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this<br>
   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my<br>
   dad after three, four years?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You asked him to take you back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't<br>
   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, "No,<br>
   that's not happening with us."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking<br>
   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my<br>
   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them<br>
   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate<br>
   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think<br>
   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon<br>
   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his<br>
   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back<br>
   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're<br>
   human beings.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or<br>
   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me<br>
   leave the room. She was like, "I can't see you right now. Leave the room.<br>
   You're so much like your dad. Leave." It really affected her. I get it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Tell me about being undocumented. When did you know? What was it<br>
   like?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just … I<br>
   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my<br>
   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things<br>
   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family<br>
   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.<br>
   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good<br>
   stories from him. [Laughs]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me—and I mean<br>
   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every<br>
   single day at her home or her grandparents’ home. If my mom couldn't find<br>
   me, she'd call L___’s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my<br>
   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, "Hey. Could you<br>
   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have<br>
   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously." All family events I<br>
   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.<br>
   We were best friends.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks<br>
   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared<br>
   like a deer in the headlights. “No, I'm not. I'm not.” I was so scared of<br>
   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody—an ex-girlfriend, I think<br>
   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we<br>
   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we<br>
   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So<br>
   I was not allowed to tell anyone.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of<br>
   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed<br>
   to tell this? This is a secret and—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.<br>
   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty<br>
   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I<br>
   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science<br>
   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not<br>
   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you<br>
   if you're an American citizen or not.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, "I am<br>
   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American." She was put<br>
   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in<br>
   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm<br>
   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody<br>
   ever knew.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected<br>
   your life. Can you talk about that too?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire<br>
   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that<br>
   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to<br>
   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't<br>
   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You<br>
   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you<br>
   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd<br>
   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled<br>
   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What<br>
   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing<br>
   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the<br>
   shadows. Nobody really knows.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You used a metaphor --<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in<br>
   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're<br>
   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in<br>
   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but<br>
   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being<br>
   in a golden cage.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How did being undocumented affect your education?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Being undocumented affected my education. The first time was when I<br>
   wanted to apply to Whitney Young—when I wanted to go to a different high<br>
   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for<br>
   it, but they were asking … I don't remember what kind of document they were<br>
   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, "You know<br>
   what? Let’s not. I don't want to. It's not worth it if I get deported. I<br>
   don't need to be—it's not necessary." So I went to my local high school,<br>
   which … not the best high school, Washington High School, but they had the<br>
   IB program.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why'd you want to go to—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my<br>
   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my<br>
   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm<br>
   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't<br>
   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated<br>
   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in<br>
   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, "Ugh. What<br>
   am I supposed to do with you?"<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is<br>
   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I<br>
   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.<br>
   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.<br>
   I think the problem with human beings is that you’re your only true enemy.<br>
   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you<br>
   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,<br>
   sniffles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.<br>
   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid<br>
   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because<br>
   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't<br>
   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get<br>
   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].<br>
   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on<br>
   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn<br>
   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then<br>
   [Chuckles] I sculpted something—a huge tiger—and I turned it in and it was<br>
   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one<br>
   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still<br>
   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I wanted to get into a good university. I was like, "Okay, high<br>
   school's fine. Okay, whatever. We're going to make do. I'm going to be the<br>
   best student wherever I am." So I started swimming, track, volleyball,<br>
   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it<br>
   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a<br>
   bunch of community work—I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog<br>
   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,<br>
   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,<br>
   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't<br>
   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted<br>
   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my<br>
   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I<br>
   was like, "Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this." I wanted to be an<br>
   oncologist—yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't<br>
   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want<br>
   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in<br>
   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I was set to go into a good future. That's what it was, but when it<br>
   came down to it, my mom was like, "No. You know what? You can't. You don't<br>
   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to<br>
   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your<br>
   books. Each book, that's like $5000 for books. We can't do that. I'm<br>
   sorry."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you qualify for DACA?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes, and that's when it had come out. Right when I had graduated<br>
   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel<br>
   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, "You know what?<br>
   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of<br>
   us." But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or<br>
   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government. That they're<br>
   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where<br>
   you live and who lives with you and where you are. I don't want that, and<br>
   she did not allow that. I know. I know. I could've, but I didn't.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you fight?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: My mom? No.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You just accepted it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: [Pause] Yes and no. It took me a while. I was even going to marry my<br>
   best friend, E___. I was like, "Let's get married. Let's get married." He<br>
   was my best friend, but he didn't know why I wanted to get married<br>
   [Laughs]. In my mind, I was like, "Fuck it. Let's do this. I'll get papers<br>
   and I'll continue my education. That's fine. Once we're married, he's stuck<br>
   with me. I'll tell him then.” [Pause] I even thought about that. I was<br>
   getting extremely desperate, but—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How did E___ think? What did he think?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: When I told him I was moving to Mexico, he offered to marry me too<br>
   so I would stay behind. I think he kind of knew at that point. I think E___<br>
   knew. He wasn't a stupid guy. He called my mom mommy. He wasn't stupid.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You returned to Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I made the decision of returning, and I uprooted my sisters. My<br>
   little sister was a year old when we left. She knew nothing about Mexico.<br>
   She barely spoke Spanish, so I selfishly made everyone move back to Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Because?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Because I wanted to continue my education.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why didn't they stay behind?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I think my mom felt guilty. I think she didn't want me to be by<br>
   myself. She felt guilty that she didn't allow me to apply for DACA, so<br>
   she's like, "Okay. That's okay." Eventually my sisters are going to have to<br>
   go through this and let's do it now so the change doesn't hurt them as much<br>
   when it comes down to it. They had it a little easier, I think [Chuckles].<br>
   They didn't have to go through it twice, or maybe that's just my<br>
   bitterness, but I had to go through that uprooting and going into a strange<br>
   country twice [Chuckles]. They don't remember Mexico at all, so I don't<br>
   think they remember any of the life that we had here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I do. I remember my dogs. I remember my mom. I remember my dad. I<br>
   remember my grandparents. I remember everything, and they didn't remember<br>
   anything. Their entire life was over there, so that's just my bitterness.<br>
   We moved back and I was so depressed. I don't think I've ever been that<br>
   depressed in my life. I had to go back to high school because … even with<br>
   the IB program. I killed myself. What was that worth, all that effort, and<br>
   all that [Chokes up]? What was it worth? Nothing. I had to go back to this<br>
   broken education system in Mexico which I could run laps around the fucking<br>
   curriculum and I had to redo it in order to go to university, and fuck,<br>
   that sucked.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I was extremely depressed. I didn't even want to leave the house<br>
   because I didn't want to be reminded of the fact that I was not in the<br>
   States anymore, because it was ugly. It was ugly where we lived.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What was school like?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Hard at first. I was bullied at first. I remember … because my<br>
   Spanish wasn't the best. When I got here, I had not practiced my Spanish in<br>
   so long. I knew how to read and write, but my grammar was not the best<br>
   either. I had kindergarten education. That's how long I [Chuckles] …<br>
   everything else, a lot of my teachers were understanding. My literature<br>
   teacher was extremely understanding. I thank him for that. He was the one<br>
   that asked me to write and I wrote a short story about a sparrow getting<br>
   lost in the snow and then turning up in the jungle, and the sparrow makes<br>
   friends with all the cockatoos and the snake and the anaconda and they're<br>
   all bros and he learns to speak their language—not very well, but he<br>
   learns.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: The sparrow gets old and keeps living there and he's like, "You know<br>
   what? I love this place and I love my friends, and even though it kills me<br>
   to leave all my friends behind here in the jungle, I need to go back to my<br>
   home," [Chokes up] so the sparrow makes his journey and he dies. He makes<br>
   it to the snow and he dies looking at the tree where he had his nest.<br>
   [Crying] My literature teacher I think was pretty impacted by that. He was<br>
   pretty understanding.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was the snow Chicago?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes. I miss the snow like crazy [Continues crying]. I remember the<br>
   first Christmas we spent here was … It didn't feel like Christmas. It did<br>
   not feel like Christmas. It felt weird. I wasn't used to it. [Pause] I gave<br>
   that to the teacher. The teacher published it. My literature teacher was<br>
   extremely well known in the community. He's world renowned, I think,<br>
   because he is the host for the International Poets Meeting. He's the host,<br>
   so I'm pretty sure he's well known in the literature world, and he<br>
   published a lot of my poetry too because I had a lot of poetry—and in<br>
   English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: He understood English and he would tear up with a lot of the stuff<br>
   that I would give him. Very, very understanding, but we bonded over<br>
   literature because he was extremely, extremely into books.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Like Mr. R?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Like Mr. R, yes. R___, that's his name.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes. He was pretty great. He would talk about philosophy. He helped<br>
   a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: [So you studied international relations] Why international<br>
   relations?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: International relations because I am a fucking citizen of the world.<br>
   Every time somebody asks me, "Where are you from?" I have no idea how to<br>
   answer because I don't feel Mexican and I don't feel American. I don't know<br>
   what I am, so fuck it. I'm going to be a citizen of the world [Chuckles].<br>
   I'm going to take all of this and I'm going to be international. That's it.<br>
   That's it. We're going to be international. That's it, because genuinely,<br>
   honest to God, I don't know how to answer when somebody asks me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I'm not sure if you've seen when they've asked me, "Where are you<br>
   from?" and I'm like, "Where was I born? Where was I raised? Where's my<br>
   family from? Where do I live? What do you want to know?” Because “where are<br>
   you from?” is a very loaded question to me. It's a lot about identity, and<br>
   I think a human being needs this [Pause] identity, this sense of belonging,<br>
   and I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't feel like I have a home.<br>
   Like a real one. At this point, I think my home is my partner and that<br>
   scares the shit out of me [Chuckles]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I've thought about it. I've thought about it a lot [Chuckles]. It<br>
   scares me because he has become my home. He's helped me through a lot. He's<br>
   helped me get through a lot of traumas. He's helped me stand up to my<br>
   father because I was not able to have a conversation with him. I was not<br>
   able to say no to my dad [Sniffles]. I always wanted to please my dad<br>
   because I never had him in my life, so I wanted him to be happy with me<br>
   now. He's helped me a lot, so scary shit [Chuckles]. I don't like thinking<br>
   about it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Only two more questions that are more reflective.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: One is this idea about what did the US lose by losing someone like<br>
   you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I'm pretty sure if I wasn't going to be an oncologist, maybe a<br>
   neuroscientist or a neurosurgeon. People like me, I'm driven, man. I'm<br>
   extremely driven. When you grow up with all of these people telling you<br>
   that you can't, you want it more and you want it more and you have this<br>
   hunger inside of you that you want it and you need it and you're going to<br>
   make it, and I'm pretty sure I could run laps around all these fuckers that<br>
   were born citizens. So they did—they lost somebody who can better society.<br>
   I'm pretty sure I had a lot to offer … in a lot of senses.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What has Mexico gained by gaining you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I think they've gained a lot. I think Mexico has gained a lot, but<br>
   they don't know how to appreciate it. They pretty much throw us aside.<br>
   Unfortunately, the Mexican government does not think that people who are<br>
   returning from the States have anything to offer, and they're dead wrong<br>
   about that. Honestly, if you look at a lot of these people that are coming<br>
   back, they have so much to offer. They have so much to give and they have<br>
   so much drive and they're hungry, but they don't make it easy for us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I had to go through hell in order to get my paperwork done for<br>
   school—through hell, and then I still had to do two years. If that was<br>
   somebody else with a little bit less drive or a little bit less enthusiasm,<br>
   they would've given up and they wouldn't have continued with their studies.<br>
   They would've said, "Fuck it. Why? They're putting me against the wall. How<br>
   am I supposed to do anything?” Anyone else for sure would've, and I know a<br>
   lot of cases where they're like, "Dude, it's just too hard. It's too hard<br>
   to keep going. They're asking me to do everything that I've already done,<br>
   and what they're asking me to do is subpar compared to the education that<br>
   I've had." So it's extremely discouraging.<br>
