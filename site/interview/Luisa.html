   apartment. It was a big complex and I remember it. There was a pool in the<br>

   apartment. And there were eight to twelve people in this one space, and we<br>
   were trying to find something bigger, but it was impossible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Do you remember what your mood was like at that time?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Jarring. It was extremely jarring.

   tilted to the side.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: How soon after getting to California did you move to Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Within three to six months. It didn't take that long … immediately</br>   kind of. I think one of my uncles took it upon himself to take care of us,</br>   and since my mom … my mom at the time, we did not know she had a tumor in</br>   the back of her brain. Right where her brain stem is, she had a huge tumor</br>   there and we had no idea. Nobody knew. She doesn't remember a lot of this.</br>   I don't know if it's because of the emotional trauma or because of the</br>   tumor, but once we got to Chicago, it was evident that something was wrong</br>   with my mother and she started going to the doctor.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Thank God for Cook County Hospital [Chuckles]. They don't charge you</br>   a thing, but she got the medical treatment that she needed. She had brain</br>   surgery. They removed the tumor and she had to be in therapy for a few</br>   years in order to gain … she couldn't talk. She didn't have movement in</br>   half of her face, so she couldn't speak because her tongue was numb on one</br>   side, so she had to have physical therapy. I went with her a couple times</br>   because I had to translate. Sometimes they didn't have people who would</br>   translate for my mother. At this point, I had already learned English, but</br>   she had to practice every single day. Still to this day, there are a few</br>   words that she cannot say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She can't pronounce them or she doesn't remember them?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She can't pronounce them. She'll talk like this [imitates] because</br>   she can't move half of her face.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tumor benign?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, it was benign. Thank God for that. But she had an encounter</br>   with TB and then she was on medication for that. You know what I think it</br>   was? I think that all this negativity affected her [Chuckles], or I don't</br>   know if you believe this, but the law of attraction. I think that she</br>   really did not want to keep going and that affected her quite a bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When did you start going to school, in Chicago or in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I moved to Chicago and that's where I started going to school. I</br>   started going to school at the age of six. Unfortunately, the school that I</br>   went to did not have a bilingual program. I was stuck with Miss S.</br>   [Chuckles]. I'm never going to forget her … Miss S., lovely woman</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that sarcastic?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, [Chuckles] very sarcastic. Did not speak a lick of Spanish. Not</br>   one sentence. I don't think she knew how to pronounce anything, and she was</br>   as WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] as you can get. This woman would get</br>   extremely frustrated with me—extremely—and I didn't know what was going on.</br>   To me, it was a completely … [Disgusted sound] it was mind-boggling how I</br>   could go from—I knew how to read and write in Spanish. I was a pretty smart</br>   kid. I knew how to read and write in Spanish at six years old. So I go into</br>   first grade and I can't even understand what my teachers are saying, so it</br>   was extremely frustrating and this teacher found it extremely frustrating</br>   as well, so she would lay me down face down half the day on the magic</br>   carpet where she would read stories to everyone because she didn't want to</br>   deal with it anymore. I told my mom—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because she didn't want to deal with what?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Deal with me anymore. I guess she didn't know where to put me. She</br>   didn't know what to do with me, she didn't know how to teach me, so her</br>   solution was to put me aside and not have to deal with me, so I had to</br>   pretty much be invisible for half the class. Just put my head down and not</br>   say a word. So I picked up English extremely fast because I had to</br>   [Chuckles]. I had to pick up English very, very, very fast or that was</br>   going to keep happening. I didn't want that to keep happening, so I picked</br>   it up.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I told my mom about this and I remember vividly having a</br>   conversation with her and telling her, &quot;Hey, you know what? This is</br>   happening at school,&quot; but I think my mom was going through so much stuff</br>   that she didn't know how to deal with it or she didn't … there wasn't</br>   enough of my mom to go around back then. I know now. I forgive her, but</br>   certain things … [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.</br>   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this</br>   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her</br>   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She</br>   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She</br>   started going to design school for designing clothes and it’s pretty great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in one second. If you were lying face down on</br>   the magic carpet all day, how did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was there for half the day, and this is something that I'm going</br>   to tell you that my teachers had told me in kindergarten. I could be</br>   sitting down underneath the table and playing around, and they would be</br>   teaching math and I could learn it. I'm an extremely fast learner—an</br>   extremely fast learner. I think I picked it up by just listening to it, and</br>   the few classes that I had, I picked it up. It was not that hard and I</br>   think at that age it's easier to absorb information, but I think it was</br>   mostly that I'm a quick learner.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did the kids tease you? Were they friendly to you? What was it like</br>   in Miss S. class?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to</br>   me, J___ and— what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good</br>   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of</br>   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher</br>   was not having it … She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of</br>   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some</br>   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They</br>   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a</br>   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is</br>   getting married soon, so yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you bullied?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied</br>   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at</br>   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a</br>   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].</br>   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was</br>   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace</br>   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school</br>   that I had to go to was not a good school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of</br>   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up</br>   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book</br>   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the</br>   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald</br>   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,</br>   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,</br>   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as</br>   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same</br>   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the</br>   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where</br>   you would go and read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In eighth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they</br>   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy</br>   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy</br>   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more</br>   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.</br>   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the</br>   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the</br>   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a</br>   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your</br>   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill</br>   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to</br>   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was</br>   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a</br>   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it</br>   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry</br>   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with</br>   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the</br>   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I</br>   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a</br>   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading</br>   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet</br>   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the</br>   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original</br>   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's</br>   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into</br>   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a</br>   huge reader [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human</br>   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,</br>   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed</br>   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have</br>   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.</br>   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.</br>   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained</br>   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black</br>   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and</br>   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,</br>   historical fiction. I was into everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge</br>   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, “are you above the</br>   law? Is anybody above the law?” Yes, I was big on reading. I loved reading</br>   [Chuckles]. Then absurdism. I'm big on reading [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You told me last time about your—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Eighth grade teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R. is the best teacher I have had and he changed my life. Mr. R</br>   is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. [Pause] I had a lot of</br>   teachers that would not … They would question me and they would ... All the</br>   stuff that I would write, they would question if I was okay mentally</br>   because of all this darkness [Chuckles] that I would write about, because a</br>   lot of my stories or a lot of my poetry was extremely dark. I don't think</br>   that's a bad thing you know. I think that's just trying to get rid of the …</br>   it's a catalyst. You're trying to get rid of everything that's inside of</br>   you, and that's how I did it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R was the first one that recognized it as something good. We</br>   still keep in touch—beautiful human being. I knew this. He would speak to</br>   me like we were adults—like I was an adult. I was a thirteen-year-old girl</br>   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was</br>   or what he saw in me, but we had conversations like adults. I would stay</br>   after class for hours just discussing books that he would give me, and he</br>   would give me books out of his collection for me to read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about</br>   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He</br>   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.</br>   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccolò Machiavelli. I</br>   actually have “the end justifies the means” tattooed on me.</br> </br> </br>   It’s tattooed back here. Realism to me was … it's real. Human beings are</br>   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will</br>   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just</br>   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,</br>   if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: But yes, Mr. R was beautiful. He was a lawyer. He was a criminal</br>   lawyer. I'm not sure what kind of lawyer he was, but he hated defending</br>   people who were guilty. That man—oh my God I love that man—he hated it. He</br>   hated defending people who were guilty. There's this program called the</br>   “Golden Apple Program” where you can switch from being whatever it is that</br>   your career is to being a teacher, and it's what he did. Beautiful,</br>   beautiful man.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I</br>   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I</br>   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and</br>   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about</br>   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting. Yes, so Mr. R was</br>   someone beautiful and he taught me that [Pause] life is short and you need</br>   to seize the day. You need to take life by the balls [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting</br>   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because</br>   reading transports you to different places and different languages and</br>   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been</br>   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,</br>   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design</br>   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You</br>   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her</br>   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they</br>   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to</br>   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,</br>   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the</br>   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their</br>   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three</br>   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was</br>   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was</br>   great. I got to meet a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,</br>   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the</br>   attire?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would</br>   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was</br>   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with</br>   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It</br>   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],</br>   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took</br>   over.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he</br>   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to</br>   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would</br>   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, &quot;Oh, my God. What's</br>   happening?&quot; But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually</br>   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,</br>   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.</br>   They were great people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something you said yesterday that you said you didn't tell me about</br>   was something about adoption.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting</br>   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the</br>   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not</br>   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the</br>   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be</br>   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our</br>   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for</br>   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put</br>   a huge stop to that and was like, &quot;That's not happening. You're stupid.</br>   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was going to be a family member, not a close family member, but</br>   these were the lengths that you go through to try to get through this. I</br>   didn't have a normal childhood. I never got to learn to drive. I didn't go</br>   to drivers ed. I didn't get to travel with my best friend to DisneyLand</br>   because my mom was so scared of—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more</br>   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that</br>   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave</br>   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,</br>   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone</br>   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who</br>   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad</br>   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,</br>   &quot;Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”</br>   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I</br>   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The</br>   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on</br>   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with</br>   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this</br>   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my</br>   dad after three, four years?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You asked him to take you back?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't</br>   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, &quot;No,</br>   that's not happening with us.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking</br>   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my</br>   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them</br>   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate</br>   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think</br>   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon</br>   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his</br>   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back</br>   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're</br>   human beings.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or</br>   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me</br>   leave the room. She was like, &quot;I can't see you right now. Leave the room.</br>   You're so much like your dad. Leave.&quot; It really affected her. I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about being undocumented. When did you know? What was it</br>   like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just … I</br>   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my</br>   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things</br>   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family</br>   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.</br>   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good</br>   stories from him. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me—and I mean</br>   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every</br>   single day at her home or her grandparents’ home. If my mom couldn't find</br>   me, she'd call L___’s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my</br>   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, &quot;Hey. Could you</br>   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have</br>   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.&quot; All family events I</br>   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.</br>   We were best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks</br>   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared</br>   like a deer in the headlights. “No, I'm not. I'm not.” I was so scared of</br>   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody—an ex-girlfriend, I think</br>   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we</br>   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we</br>   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So</br>   I was not allowed to tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of</br>   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed</br>   to tell this? This is a secret and—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.</br>   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty</br>   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I</br>   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science</br>   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not</br>   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you</br>   if you're an American citizen or not.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, &quot;I am</br>   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.&quot; She was put</br>   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in</br>   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm</br>   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody</br>   ever knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected</br>   your life. Can you talk about that too?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire</br>   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that</br>   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to</br>   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't</br>   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You</br>   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you</br>   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd</br>   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled</br>   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What</br>   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing</br>   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the</br>   shadows. Nobody really knows.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You used a metaphor --</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in</br>   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're</br>   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in</br>   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but</br>   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being</br>   in a golden cage.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did being undocumented affect your education?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented affected my education. The first time was when I</br>   wanted to apply to Whitney Young—when I wanted to go to a different high</br>   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for</br>   it, but they were asking … I don't remember what kind of document they were</br>   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, &quot;You know</br>   what? Let’s not. I don't want to. It's not worth it if I get deported. I</br>   don't need to be—it's not necessary.&quot; So I went to my local high school,</br>   which … not the best high school, Washington High School, but they had the</br>   IB program.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd you want to go to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my</br>   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my</br>   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm</br>   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't</br>   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated</br>   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in</br>   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, &quot;Ugh. What</br>   am I supposed to do with you?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is</br>   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I</br>   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.</br>   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.</br>   I think the problem with human beings is that you’re your only true enemy.</br>   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you</br>   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,</br>   sniffles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.</br>   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid</br>   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because</br>   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't</br>   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get</br>   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].</br>   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on</br>   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn</br>   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then</br>   [Chuckles] I sculpted something—a huge tiger—and I turned it in and it was</br>   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one</br>   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still</br>   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to get into a good university. I was like, &quot;Okay, high</br>   school's fine. Okay, whatever. We're going to make do. I'm going to be the</br>   best student wherever I am.&quot; So I started swimming, track, volleyball,</br>   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it</br>   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a</br>   bunch of community work—I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog</br>   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,</br>   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,</br>   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't</br>   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted</br>   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my</br>   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I</br>   was like, &quot;Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this.&quot; I wanted to be an</br>   oncologist—yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't</br>   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want</br>   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in</br>   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was set to go into a good future. That's what it was, but when it</br>   came down to it, my mom was like, &quot;No. You know what? You can't. You don't</br>   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to</br>   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your</br>   books. Each book, that's like $5000 for books. We can't do that. I'm</br>   sorry.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, and that's when it had come out. Right when I had graduated</br>   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel</br>   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, &quot;You know what?</br>   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of</br>   us.&quot; But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or</br>   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government. That they're</br>   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where</br>   you live and who lives with you and where you are. I don't want that, and</br>   she did not allow that. I know. I know. I could've, but I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you fight?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My mom? No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just accepted it?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Yes and no. It took me a while. I was even going to marry my</br>   best friend, E___. I was like, &quot;Let's get married. Let's get married.&quot; He</br>   was my best friend, but he didn't know why I wanted to get married</br>   [Laughs]. In my mind, I was like, &quot;Fuck it. Let's do this. I'll get papers</br>   and I'll continue my education. That's fine. Once we're married, he's stuck</br>   with me. I'll tell him then.” [Pause] I even thought about that. I was</br>   getting extremely desperate, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did E___ think? What did he think?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I told him I was moving to Mexico, he offered to marry me too</br>   so I would stay behind. I think he kind of knew at that point. I think E___</br>   knew. He wasn't a stupid guy. He called my mom mommy. He wasn't stupid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You returned to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I made the decision of returning, and I uprooted my sisters. My</br>   little sister was a year old when we left. She knew nothing about Mexico.</br>   She barely spoke Spanish, so I selfishly made everyone move back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Because I wanted to continue my education.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why didn't they stay behind?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I think my mom felt guilty. I think she didn't want me to be by</br>   myself. She felt guilty that she didn't allow me to apply for DACA, so</br>   she's like, &quot;Okay. That's okay.&quot; Eventually my sisters are going to have to</br>   go through this and let's do it now so the change doesn't hurt them as much</br>   when it comes down to it. They had it a little easier, I think [Chuckles].</br>   They didn't have to go through it twice, or maybe that's just my</br>   bitterness, but I had to go through that uprooting and going into a strange</br>   country twice [Chuckles]. They don't remember Mexico at all, so I don't</br>   think they remember any of the life that we had here.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I do. I remember my dogs. I remember my mom. I remember my dad. I</br>   remember my grandparents. I remember everything, and they didn't remember</br>   anything. Their entire life was over there, so that's just my bitterness.</br>   We moved back and I was so depressed. I don't think I've ever been that</br>   depressed in my life. I had to go back to high school because … even with</br>   the IB program. I killed myself. What was that worth, all that effort, and</br>   all that [Chokes up]? What was it worth? Nothing. I had to go back to this</br>   broken education system in Mexico which I could run laps around the fucking</br>   curriculum and I had to redo it in order to go to university, and fuck,</br>   that sucked.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was extremely depressed. I didn't even want to leave the house</br>   because I didn't want to be reminded of the fact that I was not in the</br>   States anymore, because it was ugly. It was ugly where we lived.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was school like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Hard at first. I was bullied at first. I remember … because my</br>   Spanish wasn't the best. When I got here, I had not practiced my Spanish in</br>   so long. I knew how to read and write, but my grammar was not the best</br>   either. I had kindergarten education. That's how long I [Chuckles] …</br>   everything else, a lot of my teachers were understanding. My literature</br>   teacher was extremely understanding. I thank him for that. He was the one</br>   that asked me to write and I wrote a short story about a sparrow getting</br>   lost in the snow and then turning up in the jungle, and the sparrow makes</br>   friends with all the cockatoos and the snake and the anaconda and they're</br>   all bros and he learns to speak their language—not very well, but he</br>   learns.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: The sparrow gets old and keeps living there and he's like, &quot;You know</br>   what? I love this place and I love my friends, and even though it kills me</br>   to leave all my friends behind here in the jungle, I need to go back to my</br>   home,&quot; [Chokes up] so the sparrow makes his journey and he dies. He makes</br>   it to the snow and he dies looking at the tree where he had his nest.</br>   [Crying] My literature teacher I think was pretty impacted by that. He was</br>   pretty understanding.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the snow Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I miss the snow like crazy [Continues crying]. I remember the</br>   first Christmas we spent here was … It didn't feel like Christmas. It did</br>   not feel like Christmas. It felt weird. I wasn't used to it. [Pause] I gave</br>   that to the teacher. The teacher published it. My literature teacher was</br>   extremely well known in the community. He's world renowned, I think,</br>   because he is the host for the International Poets Meeting. He's the host,</br>   so I'm pretty sure he's well known in the literature world, and he</br>   published a lot of my poetry too because I had a lot of poetry—and in</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He understood English and he would tear up with a lot of the stuff</br>   that I would give him. Very, very understanding, but we bonded over</br>   literature because he was extremely, extremely into books.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like Mr. R?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Like Mr. R, yes. R___, that's his name.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. He was pretty great. He would talk about philosophy. He helped</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [So you studied international relations] Why international</br>   relations?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: International relations because I am a fucking citizen of the world.</br>   Every time somebody asks me, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; I have no idea how to</br>   answer because I don't feel Mexican and I don't feel American. I don't know</br>   what I am, so fuck it. I'm going to be a citizen of the world [Chuckles].</br>   I'm going to take all of this and I'm going to be international. That's it.</br>   That's it. We're going to be international. That's it, because genuinely,</br>   honest to God, I don't know how to answer when somebody asks me.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you've seen when they've asked me, &quot;Where are you</br>   from?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;Where was I born? Where was I raised? Where's my</br>   family from? Where do I live? What do you want to know?” Because “where are</br>   you from?” is a very loaded question to me. It's a lot about identity, and</br>   I think a human being needs this [Pause] identity, this sense of belonging,</br>   and <span id="cbdbdb9d-3d6b-4947-adb4-e9dacba17472" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Reflections">I don't feel like I belong anywhere.

 <br>
  </span> Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks</br>   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared</br>   like a deer in the headlights. “No, I'm not. I'm not.” I was so scared of</br>   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody—an ex-girlfriend, I think</br>   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we</br>   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we</br>   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So</br>   I was not allowed to tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of</br>   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed</br>   to tell this? This is a secret and—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.</br>   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty</br>   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I</br>   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science</br>   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not</br>   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you</br>   if you're an American citizen or not.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, &quot;I am</br>   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.&quot; She was put</br>   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in</br>   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm</br>   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody</br>   ever knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected</br>   your life. Can you talk about that too?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire</br>   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that</br>   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to</br>   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't</br>   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You</br>   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you</br>   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd</br>   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled</br>   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What</br>   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing</br>   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the</br>   shadows. Nobody really knows.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You used a metaphor --</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in</br>   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're</br>   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in</br>   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but</br>   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being</br>   in a golden cage.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did being undocumented affect your education?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented affected my education. The first time was when I</br>   wanted to apply to Whitney Young—when I wanted to go to a different high</br>   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for</br>   it, but they were asking … I don't remember what kind of document they were</br>   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, &quot;You know</br>   what? Let’s not. I don't want to. It's not worth it if I get deported. I</br>   don't need to be—it's not necessary.&quot; So I went to my local high school,</br>   which … not the best high school, Washington High School, but they had the</br>   IB program.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd you want to go to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my</br>   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my</br>   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm</br>   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't</br>   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated</br>   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in</br>   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, &quot;Ugh. What</br>   am I supposed to do with you?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is</br>   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I</br>   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.</br>   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.</br>   I think the problem with human beings is that you’re your only true enemy.</br>   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you</br>   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,</br>   sniffles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.</br>   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid</br>   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because</br>   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't</br>   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get</br>   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].</br>   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on</br>   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn</br>   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then</br>   [Chuckles] I sculpted something—a huge tiger—and I turned it in and it was</br>   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one</br>   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still</br>   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to get into a good university. I was like, &quot;Okay, high</br>   school's fine. Okay, whatever. We're going to make do. I'm going to be the</br>   best student wherever I am.&quot; So I started swimming, track, volleyball,</br>   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it</br>   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a</br>   bunch of community work—I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog</br>   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,</br>   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,</br>   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't</br>   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted</br>   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my</br>   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I</br>   was like, &quot;Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this.&quot; I wanted to be an</br>   oncologist—yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't</br>   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want</br>   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in</br>   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was set to go into a good future. That's what it was, but when it</br>   came down to it, my mom was like, &quot;No. You know what? You can't. You don't</br>   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to</br>   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your</br>   books. Each book, that's like $5000 for books. We can't do that. I'm</br>   sorry.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, and that's when it had come out. Right when I had graduated</br>   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel</br>   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, &quot;You know what?</br>   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of</br>   us.&quot; But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or</br>   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government.

I was</br>   getting extremely desperate, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did E___ think? What did he think?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I told him I was moving to Mexico, he offered to marry me too</br>   so I would stay behind. I think he kind of knew at that point. I think E___</br>   knew. He wasn't a stupid guy. He called my mom mommy. He wasn't stupid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You returned to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I made the decision of returning, and I uprooted my sisters.

 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in<br>
   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're<br>
   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in<br>
   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but<br>
   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being<br>
   in a golden cage.<br>

   your life. Can you talk about that too?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire<br>
   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that<br>
   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to<br>
   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't<br>
   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You<br>
   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you<br>
   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd<br>
   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled<br>
   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What<br>
   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing<br>
   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the<br>
   shadows. Nobody really knows.<br>

   like?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just … I<br>
   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my<br>
   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things<br>
   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family<br>
   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.<br>
   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good<br>
   stories from him. [Laughs]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me—and I mean<br>
   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every<br>
   single day at her home or her grandparents’ home. If my mom couldn't find<br>
   me, she'd call L___’s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my<br>
   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, &quot;Hey. Could you<br>
   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have<br>
   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.&quot; All family events I<br>
   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.<br>
   We were best friends.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks<br>
   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared<br>
   like a deer in the headlights. “No, I'm not. I'm not.” I was so scared of<br>

   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we<br>
   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So<br>
   I was not allowed to tell anyone.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of<br>
   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed<br>
   to tell this? This is a secret and—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.<br>
   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty<br>
   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I<br>
   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science<br>
   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not<br>
   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you<br>
   if you're an American citizen or not.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, &quot;I am<br>
   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.&quot; She was put<br>
   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in<br>
   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm<br>
   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody<br>
   ever knew.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="e3de695a-996f-4b26-8927-3ce96bfbdf83" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife, Parents/step-parents">Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more<br>
   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that<br>
   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave<br>
   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,<br>
   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone<br>
   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who<br>
   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad<br>
   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,<br>
   &quot;Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”<br>
   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I<br>
   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The<br>
   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on<br>
   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with<br>
   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this<br>
   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my<br>
   dad after three, four years?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You asked him to take you back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't<br>
   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, &quot;No,<br>
   that's not happening with us.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking<br>
   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my<br>
   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them<br>
   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate<br>
   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think<br>
   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon<br>
   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his<br>
   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back<br>
   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're<br>
   human beings.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or<br>
   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me<br>
   leave the room. She was like, &quot;I can't see you right now. Leave the room.<br>
   You're so much like your dad. Leave.&quot; It really affected her. I get it.<br>

 <br>

   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the<br>
   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not<br>
   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the<br>
   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be<br>
   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our<br>

   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting<br>
   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because<br>
   reading transports you to different places and different languages and<br>
   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been<br>
   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,<br>
   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design<br>
   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You<br>
   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her<br>
   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they<br>
   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to<br>
   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,<br>
   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the<br>
   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their<br>
   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three<br>
   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was<br>
   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was<br>
   great. I got to meet a lot of people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,<br>
   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the<br>
   attire?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would<br>
   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was<br>
   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with<br>
   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It<br>
   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],<br>
   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took<br>
   over.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he<br>
   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to<br>
   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would<br>
   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, &quot;Oh, my God. What's<br>
   happening?&quot; But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually<br>
   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,<br>
   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.<br>
   They were great people.<br>

   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?<br>

   you would go and read.<br>

 <br>
   Luisa: In eighth grade?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they<br>
   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy<br>
   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy<br>
   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more<br>
   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.<br>
   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the<br>
   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the<br>
   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a<br>
   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your<br>
   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill<br>
   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to<br>
   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was<br>
   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a<br>
   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.<br>

 <br>
 <br>

   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.<br>
   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I<br>
   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go<br>
   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They<br>
   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side. I<br>
   would lay and sleep on my dad's chest always. Always, always, always,<br>
   always, always, so it was extremely difficult to leave my dad behind the<br>
   most. My dad was my world back then. But my dad, my friends, school—school<br>
   was great, I loved school [Chuckles]—I had to leave it all behind.<br>

   The older I get, the more she opens up, but it's not something that she<br>
   likes to talk about. It was never in front of us, it was behind closed<br>
   doors. I thank my father. He's a piece of shit, but I thank him for at<br>
   least having the thought of not wanting to traumatize us. So yes, it was<br>
   behind closed doors, but the more I get out of my mom, it was a lot of<br>
   emotional abuse as well, a lot. I think there was some physical abuse. My<br>
   mom's never touched upon it, but that's what happened. And then we got to<br>

Was there any</br>   domestic abuse in your family?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: With my parents? My mother, yes. She doesn't like to talk about it.</br>   The older I get, the more she opens up, but it's not something that she</br>   likes to talk about. It was never in front of us, it was behind closed</br>   doors. I thank my father. He's a piece of shit, but I thank him for at</br>   least having the thought of not wanting to traumatize us. So yes, it was</br>   behind closed doors, but the more I get out of my mom, it was a lot of</br>   emotional abuse as well, a lot. I think there was some physical abuse. My</br>   mom's never touched upon it, but that's what happened. And then we got to</br>   Chicago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time we spoke, you talked about how difficult it was to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To leave my dad?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... to leave things behind.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Of course. I grew up fairly wealthy in Mexico. I had a big, big</br>   house. I had two German Shepherds that ran around everywhere. I had a</br>   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.</br>   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I</br>   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go</br>   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They</br>   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side. I</br>   would lay and sleep on my dad's chest always. Always, always, always,</br>   always, always, so it was extremely difficult to leave my dad behind the</br>   most. My dad was my world back then. But my dad, my friends, school—school</br>   was great, I loved school [Chuckles]—I had to leave it all behind.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I left, I was six years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The apartment you moved into—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: The apartment that we moved into in California was a one-bedroom</br>   apartment. It was a big complex and I remember it. There was a pool in the</br>   middle and there were a lot of families like us that shared a one-bedroom</br>   apartment. And there were eight to twelve people in this one space, and we</br>   were trying to find something bigger, but it was impossible.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember what your mood was like at that time?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Jarring. It was extremely jarring. From one day to another, the move</br>   was extremely … it was jarring. One day, you have a family and you're</br>   happy, and then the next, you can't even speak the language. You can't</br>   communicate, you don't know where you're at. I felt like my whole world was</br>   tilted to the side.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How soon after getting to California did you move to Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Within three to six months. It didn't take that long … immediately</br>   kind of. I think one of my uncles took it upon himself to take care of us,</br>   and since my mom … my mom at the time, we did not know she had a tumor in</br>   the back of her brain. Right where her brain stem is, she had a huge tumor</br>   there and we had no idea. Nobody knew. She doesn't remember a lot of this.</br>   I don't know if it's because of the emotional trauma or because of the</br>   tumor, but once we got to Chicago, it was evident that something was wrong</br>   with my mother and she started going to the doctor.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Thank God for Cook County Hospital [Chuckles]. They don't charge you</br>   a thing, but she got the medical treatment that she needed. She had brain</br>   surgery. They removed the tumor and she had to be in therapy for a few</br>   years in order to gain … she couldn't talk. She didn't have movement in</br>   half of her face, so she couldn't speak because her tongue was numb on one</br>   side, so she had to have physical therapy. I went with her a couple times</br>   because I had to translate. Sometimes they didn't have people who would</br>   translate for my mother. At this point, I had already learned English, but</br>   she had to practice every single day. Still to this day, there are a few</br>   words that she cannot say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She can't pronounce them or she doesn't remember them?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She can't pronounce them. She'll talk like this [imitates] because</br>   she can't move half of her face.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tumor benign?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, it was benign. Thank God for that. But she had an encounter</br>   with TB and then she was on medication for that. You know what I think it</br>   was? I think that all this negativity affected her [Chuckles], or I don't</br>   know if you believe this, but the law of attraction. I think that she</br>   really did not want to keep going and that affected her quite a bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When did you start going to school, in Chicago or in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I moved to Chicago and that's where I started going to school. I</br>   started going to school at the age of six. Unfortunately, the school that I</br>   went to did not have a bilingual program. I was stuck with Miss S.</br>   [Chuckles]. I'm never going to forget her … Miss S., lovely woman</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that sarcastic?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, [Chuckles] very sarcastic. Did not speak a lick of Spanish. Not</br>   one sentence. I don't think she knew how to pronounce anything, and she was</br>   as WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] as you can get. This woman would get</br>   extremely frustrated with me—extremely—and I didn't know what was going on.</br>   To me, it was a completely … [Disgusted sound] it was mind-boggling how I</br>   could go from—I knew how to read and write in Spanish. I was a pretty smart</br>   kid. I knew how to read and write in Spanish at six years old. So I go into</br>   first grade and I can't even understand what my teachers are saying, so it</br>   was extremely frustrating and this teacher found it extremely frustrating</br>   as well, so she would lay me down face down half the day on the magic</br>   carpet where she would read stories to everyone because she didn't want to</br>   deal with it anymore. I told my mom—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because she didn't want to deal with what?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Deal with me anymore. I guess she didn't know where to put me. She</br>   didn't know what to do with me, she didn't know how to teach me, so her</br>   solution was to put me aside and not have to deal with me, so I had to</br>   pretty much be invisible for half the class. Just put my head down and not</br>   say a word. So I picked up English extremely fast because I had to</br>   [Chuckles]. I had to pick up English very, very, very fast or that was</br>   going to keep happening. I didn't want that to keep happening, so I picked</br>   it up.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I told my mom about this and I remember vividly having a</br>   conversation with her and telling her, &quot;Hey, you know what? This is</br>   happening at school,&quot; but I think my mom was going through so much stuff</br>   that she didn't know how to deal with it or she didn't … there wasn't</br>   enough of my mom to go around back then. I know now. I forgive her, but</br>   certain things … [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.</br>   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this</br>   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her</br>   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She</br>   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She</br>   started going to design school for designing clothes and it’s pretty great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in one second. If you were lying face down on</br>   the magic carpet all day, how did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was there for half the day, and this is something that I'm going</br>   to tell you that my teachers had told me in kindergarten. I could be</br>   sitting down underneath the table and playing around, and they would be</br>   teaching math and I could learn it. I'm an extremely fast learner—an</br>   extremely fast learner. I think I picked it up by just listening to it, and</br>   the few classes that I had, I picked it up. It was not that hard and I</br>   think at that age it's easier to absorb information, but I think it was</br>   mostly that I'm a quick learner.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did the kids tease you? Were they friendly to you? What was it like</br>   in Miss S. class?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to</br>   me, J___ and— what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good</br>   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of</br>   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher</br>   was not having it … She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of</br>   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some</br>   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They</br>   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a</br>   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is</br>   getting married soon, so yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you bullied?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied</br>   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at</br>   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a</br>   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].</br>   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was</br>   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace</br>   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school</br>   that I had to go to was not a good school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of</br>   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up</br>   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book</br>   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the</br>   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald</br>   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,</br>   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,</br>   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as</br>   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same</br>   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the</br>   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where</br>   you would go and read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In eighth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they</br>   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy</br>   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy</br>   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more</br>   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.</br>   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the</br>   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the</br>   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a</br>   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your</br>   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill</br>   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to</br>   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was</br>   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a</br>   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it</br>   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry</br>   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with</br>   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the</br>   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I</br>   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a</br>   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading</br>   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet</br>   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the</br>   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original</br>   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's</br>   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into</br>   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a</br>   huge reader [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human</br>   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,</br>   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed</br>   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have</br>   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.</br>   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.</br>   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained</br>   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black</br>   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and</br>   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,</br>   historical fiction. I was into everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge</br>   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, “are you above the</br>   law? Is anybody above the law?” Yes, I was big on reading. I loved reading</br>   [Chuckles]. Then absurdism. I'm big on reading [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You told me last time about your—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Eighth grade teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R. is the best teacher I have had and he changed my life. Mr. R</br>   is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. [Pause] I had a lot of</br>   teachers that would not … They would question me and they would ... All the</br>   stuff that I would write, they would question if I was okay mentally</br>   because of all this darkness [Chuckles] that I would write about, because a</br>   lot of my stories or a lot of my poetry was extremely dark. I don't think</br>   that's a bad thing you know. I think that's just trying to get rid of the …</br>   it's a catalyst. You're trying to get rid of everything that's inside of</br>   you, and that's how I did it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R was the first one that recognized it as something good. We</br>   still keep in touch—beautiful human being. I knew this. He would speak to</br>   me like we were adults—like I was an adult. I was a thirteen-year-old girl</br>   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was</br>   or what he saw in me, but we had conversations like adults. I would stay</br>   after class for hours just discussing books that he would give me, and he</br>   would give me books out of his collection for me to read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about</br>   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He</br>   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.</br>   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccolò Machiavelli. I</br>   actually have “the end justifies the means” tattooed on me.</br> </br> </br>   It’s tattooed back here. Realism to me was … it's real. Human beings are</br>   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will</br>   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just</br>   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,</br>   if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: But yes, Mr. R was beautiful. He was a lawyer. He was a criminal</br>   lawyer. I'm not sure what kind of lawyer he was, but he hated defending</br>   people who were guilty. That man—oh my God I love that man—he hated it. He</br>   hated defending people who were guilty. There's this program called the</br>   “Golden Apple Program” where you can switch from being whatever it is that</br>   your career is to being a teacher, and it's what he did. Beautiful,</br>   beautiful man.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I</br>   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I</br>   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and</br>   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about</br>   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting. Yes, so Mr. R was</br>   someone beautiful and he taught me that [Pause] life is short and you need</br>   to seize the day. You need to take life by the balls [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting</br>   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because</br>   reading transports you to different places and different languages and</br>   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been</br>   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,</br>   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design</br>   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You</br>   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her</br>   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they</br>   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to</br>   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,</br>   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the</br>   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their</br>   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three</br>   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was</br>   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was</br>   great. I got to meet a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,</br>   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the</br>   attire?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would</br>   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was</br>   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with</br>   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It</br>   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],</br>   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took</br>   over.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he</br>   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to</br>   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would</br>   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, &quot;Oh, my God. What's</br>   happening?&quot; But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually</br>   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,</br>   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.</br>   They were great people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something you said yesterday that you said you didn't tell me about</br>   was something about adoption.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting</br>   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the</br>   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not</br>   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the</br>   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be</br>   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our</br>   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for</br>   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put</br>   a huge stop to that and was like, &quot;That's not happening. You're stupid.</br>   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was going to be a family member, not a close family member, but</br>   these were the lengths that you go through to try to get through this. I</br>   didn't have a normal childhood. I never got to learn to drive. I didn't go</br>   to drivers ed. I didn't get to travel with my best friend to DisneyLand</br>   because my mom was so scared of—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more</br>   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that</br>   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave</br>   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,</br>   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone</br>   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who</br>   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad</br>   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,</br>   &quot;Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”</br>   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I</br>   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The</br>   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on</br>   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with</br>   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this</br>   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my</br>   dad after three, four years?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You asked him to take you back?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't</br>   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, &quot;No,</br>   that's not happening with us.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking</br>   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my</br>   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them</br>   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate</br>   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think</br>   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon</br>   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his</br>   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back</br>   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're</br>   human beings.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or</br>   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me</br>   leave the room. She was like, &quot;I can't see you right now. Leave the room.</br>   You're so much like your dad. Leave.&quot; It really affected her. I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about being undocumented. When did you know? What was it</br>   like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just … I</br>   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my</br>   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things</br>   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family</br>   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.</br>   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good</br>   stories from him. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me—and I mean</br>   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every</br>   single day at her home or her grandparents’ home. If my mom couldn't find</br>   me, she'd call L___’s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my</br>   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, &quot;Hey. Could you</br>   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have</br>   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.&quot; All family events I</br>   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.</br>   We were best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks</br>   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared</br>   like a deer in the headlights. “No, I'm not. I'm not.” I was so scared of</br>   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody—an ex-girlfriend, I think</br>   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we</br>   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we</br>   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So</br>   I was not allowed to tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of</br>   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed</br>   to tell this? This is a secret and—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.</br>   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty</br>   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I</br>   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science</br>   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not</br>   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you</br>   if you're an American citizen or not.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, &quot;I am</br>   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.&quot; She was put</br>   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in</br>   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm</br>   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody</br>   ever knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected</br>   your life. Can you talk about that too?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire</br>   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that</br>   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to</br>   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't</br>   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You</br>   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you</br>   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd</br>   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled</br>   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What</br>   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing</br>   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the</br>   shadows. Nobody really knows.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You used a metaphor --</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in</br>   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're</br>   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in</br>   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but</br>   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being</br>   in a golden cage.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did being undocumented affect your education?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented affected my education. The first time was when I</br>   wanted to apply to Whitney Young—when I wanted to go to a different high</br>   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for</br>   it, but they were asking … I don't remember what kind of document they were</br>   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, &quot;You know</br>   what? Let’s not. I don't want to. It's not worth it if I get deported. I</br>   don't need to be—it's not necessary.&quot; So I went to my local high school,</br>   which … not the best high school, Washington High School, but they had the</br>   IB program.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd you want to go to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my</br>   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my</br>   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm</br>   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't</br>   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated</br>   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in</br>   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, &quot;Ugh. What</br>   am I supposed to do with you?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is</br>   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I</br>   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.</br>   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.</br>   I think the problem with human beings is that you’re your only true enemy.</br>   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you</br>   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,</br>   sniffles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.</br>   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid</br>   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because</br>   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't</br>   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get</br>   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].</br>   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on</br>   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn</br>   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then</br>   [Chuckles] I sculpted something—a huge tiger—and I turned it in and it was</br>   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one</br>   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still</br>   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to get into a good university. I was like, &quot;Okay, high</br>   school's fine. Okay, whatever. We're going to make do. I'm going to be the</br>   best student wherever I am.&quot; So I started swimming, track, volleyball,</br>   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it</br>   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a</br>   bunch of community work—I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog</br>   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,</br>   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,</br>   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't</br>   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted</br>   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my</br>   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I</br>   was like, &quot;Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this.&quot; I wanted to be an</br>   oncologist—yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't</br>   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want</br>   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in</br>   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was set to go into a good future. That's what it was, but when it</br>   came down to it, my mom was like, &quot;No. You know what? You can't. You don't</br>   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to</br>   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your</br>   books. Each book, that's like $5000 for books. We can't do that. I'm</br>   sorry.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, and that's when it had come out. Right when I had graduated</br>   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel</br>   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, &quot;You know what?</br>   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of</br>   us.&quot; But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or</br>   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government. That they're</br>   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where</br>   you live and who lives with you and where you are. I don't want that, and</br>   she did not allow that. I know. I know. I could've, but I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you fight?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My mom? No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just accepted it?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Yes and no. It took me a while. I was even going to marry my</br>   best friend, E___. I was like, &quot;Let's get married. Let's get married.&quot; He</br>   was my best friend, but he didn't know why I wanted to get married</br>   [Laughs]. In my mind, I was like, &quot;Fuck it. Let's do this. I'll get papers</br>   and I'll continue my education. That's fine. Once we're married, he's stuck</br>   with me. I'll tell him then.” [Pause] I even thought about that. I was</br>   getting extremely desperate, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did E___ think? What did he think?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I told him I was moving to Mexico, he offered to marry me too</br>   so I would stay behind. I think he kind of knew at that point. I think E___</br>   knew. He wasn't a stupid guy. He called my mom mommy. He wasn't stupid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You returned to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I made the decision of returning, and I uprooted my sisters. My</br>   little sister was a year old when we left. She knew nothing about Mexico.</br>   She barely spoke Spanish, so I selfishly made everyone move back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Because I wanted to continue my education.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why didn't they stay behind?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I think my mom felt guilty. I think she didn't want me to be by</br>   myself. She felt guilty that she didn't allow me to apply for DACA, so</br>   she's like, &quot;Okay. That's okay.&quot; Eventually my sisters are going to have to</br>   go through this and let's do it now so the change doesn't hurt them as much</br>   when it comes down to it. They had it a little easier, I think [Chuckles].</br>   They didn't have to go through it twice, or maybe that's just my</br>   bitterness, but I had to go through that uprooting and going into a strange</br>   country twice [Chuckles]. They don't remember Mexico at all, so I don't</br>   think they remember any of the life that we had here.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I do. I remember my dogs. I remember my mom. I remember my dad. I</br>   remember my grandparents. I remember everything, and they didn't remember</br>   anything. Their entire life was over there, so that's just my bitterness.</br>   We moved back and I was so depressed. I don't think I've ever been that</br>   depressed in my life. I had to go back to high school because … even with</br>   the IB program. I killed myself. What was that worth, all that effort, and</br>   all that [Chokes up]? What was it worth? Nothing. I had to go back to this</br>   broken education system in Mexico which I could run laps around the fucking</br>   curriculum and I had to redo it in order to go to university, and fuck,</br>   that sucked.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was extremely depressed. I didn't even want to leave the house</br>   because I didn't want to be reminded of the fact that I was not in the</br>   States anymore, because it was ugly. It was ugly where we lived.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was school like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Hard at first. I was bullied at first. I remember … because my</br>   Spanish wasn't the best. When I got here, I had not practiced my Spanish in</br>   so long. I knew how to read and write, but my grammar was not the best</br>   either. I had kindergarten education. That's how long I [Chuckles] …</br>   everything else, a lot of my teachers were understanding. My literature</br>   teacher was extremely understanding. I thank him for that. He was the one</br>   that asked me to write and I wrote a short story about a sparrow getting</br>   lost in the snow and then turning up in the jungle, and the sparrow makes</br>   friends with all the cockatoos and the snake and the anaconda and they're</br>   all bros and he learns to speak their language—not very well, but he</br>   learns.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: The sparrow gets old and keeps living there and he's like, &quot;You know</br>   what? I love this place and I love my friends, and even though it kills me</br>   to leave all my friends behind here in the jungle, I need to go back to my</br>   home,&quot; [Chokes up] so the sparrow makes his journey and he dies. He makes</br>   it to the snow and he dies looking at the tree where he had his nest.</br>   [Crying] My literature teacher I think was pretty impacted by that. He was</br>   pretty understanding.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the snow Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I miss the snow like crazy [Continues crying]. I remember the</br>   first Christmas we spent here was … It didn't feel like Christmas. It did</br>   not feel like Christmas. It felt weird. I wasn't used to it. [Pause] I gave</br>   that to the teacher. The teacher published it. My literature teacher was</br>   extremely well known in the community. He's world renowned, I think,</br>   because he is the host for the International Poets Meeting. He's the host,</br>   so I'm pretty sure he's well known in the literature world, and he</br>   published a lot of my poetry too because I had a lot of poetry—and in</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He understood English and he would tear up with a lot of the stuff</br>   that I would give him. Very, very understanding, but we bonded over</br>   literature because he was extremely, extremely into books.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like Mr. R?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Like Mr. R, yes. R___, that's his name.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. He was pretty great. He would talk about philosophy. He helped</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [So you studied international relations] Why international</br>   relations?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: International relations because I am a fucking citizen of the world.</br>   Every time somebody asks me, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; I have no idea how to</br>   answer because I don't feel Mexican and I don't feel American. I don't know</br>   what I am, so fuck it. I'm going to be a citizen of the world [Chuckles].</br>   I'm going to take all of this and I'm going to be international. That's it.</br>   That's it. We're going to be international. That's it, because genuinely,</br>   honest to God, I don't know how to answer when somebody asks me.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you've seen when they've asked me, &quot;Where are you</br>   from?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;Where was I born? Where was I raised? Where's my</br>   family from? Where do I live? What do you want to know?” Because “where are</br>   you from?” is a very loaded question to me. It's a lot about identity, and</br>   I think a human being needs this [Pause] identity, this sense of belonging,</br>   and I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't feel like I have a home.</br>   Like a real one. At this point, I think my home is my partner and that</br>   scares the shit out of me [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I've thought about it. I've thought about it a lot [Chuckles]. It</br>   scares me because he has become my home. He's helped me through a lot. He's</br>   helped me get through a lot of traumas. He's helped me stand up to my</br>   father because I was not able to have a conversation with him. I was not</br>   able to say no to my dad [Sniffles]. I always wanted to please my dad</br>   because I never had him in my life, so I wanted him to be happy with me</br>   now. He's helped me a lot, so scary shit [Chuckles]. I don't like thinking</br>   about it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only two more questions that are more reflective.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: One is this idea about what did the US lose by losing someone like</br>   you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm pretty sure if I wasn't going to be an oncologist, maybe a</br>   neuroscientist or a neurosurgeon. People like me, I'm driven, man. I'm</br>   extremely driven. When you grow up with all of these people telling you</br>   that you can't, you want it more and you want it more and you have this</br>   hunger inside of you that you want it and you need it and you're going to</br>   make it, and I'm pretty sure I could run laps around all these fuckers that</br>   were born citizens. So they did—they lost somebody who can better society.</br>   I'm pretty sure I had a lot to offer … in a lot of senses.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What has Mexico gained by gaining you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I think they've gained a lot. I think Mexico has gained a lot, but</br>   they don't know how to appreciate it. They pretty much throw us aside.</br>   Unfortunately, the Mexican government does not think that people who are</br>   returning from the States have anything to offer, and they're dead wrong</br>   about that. Honestly, if you look at a lot of these people that are coming</br>   back, they have so much to offer. They have so much to give and they have</br>   so much drive and they're hungry, but they don't make it easy for us.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I had to go through hell in order to get my paperwork done for</br>   school—through hell, and then I still had to do two years. If that was</br>   somebody else with a little bit less drive or a little bit less enthusiasm,</br>   they would've given up and they wouldn't have continued with their studies.</br>   They would've said, &quot;Fuck it. Why? They're putting me against the wall. How</br>   am I supposed to do anything?” Anyone else for sure would've, and I know a</br>   lot of cases where they're like, &quot;Dude, it's just too hard.

   family from? Where do I live? What do you want to know?” Because “where are<br>
   you from?” is a very loaded question to me. It's a lot about identity, and<br>
   I think a human being needs this [Pause] identity, this sense of belonging,<br>
   and I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't feel like I have a home.<br>

   scares me because he has become my home. He's helped me through a lot. He's<br>
   helped me get through a lot of traumas. He's helped me stand up to my<br>

   able to say no to my dad [Sniffles]. I always wanted to please my dad<br>

You can't. You don't</br>   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to</br>   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your</br>   books.

That they're</br>   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where</br>   you live and who lives with you and where you are.

   wanted to apply to Whitney Young—when I wanted to go to a different high<br>
   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for<br>
   it, but they were asking … I don't remember what kind of document they were<br>

 <br>
  </span> Anita: Why'd you want to go to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my</br>   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at.

   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on<br>
   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn<br>
   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then<br>
   [Chuckles] I sculpted something—a huge tiger—and I turned it in and it was<br>
   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one<br>
   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still<br>
   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.<br>

It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,</br>   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design</br>   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You</br>   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her</br>   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they</br>   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to</br>   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,</br>   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the</br>   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their</br>   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three</br>   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was</br>   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was</br>   great. I got to meet a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,</br>   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the</br>   attire?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would</br>   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was</br>   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with</br>   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It</br>   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],</br>   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took</br>   over.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he</br>   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to</br>   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would</br>   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, &quot;Oh, my God. What's</br>   happening?&quot; But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually</br>   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,</br>   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.</br>   They were great people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something you said yesterday that you said you didn't tell me about</br>   was something about adoption.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting</br>   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the</br>   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not</br>   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the</br>   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be</br>   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our</br>   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for</br>   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put</br>   a huge stop to that and was like, &quot;That's not happening. You're stupid.</br>   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was going to be a family member, not a close family member, but</br>   these were the lengths that you go through to try to get through this. I</br>   didn't have a normal childhood. I never got to learn to drive. I didn't go</br>   to drivers ed. I didn't get to travel with my best friend to DisneyLand</br>   because my mom was so scared of—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in a second.

You said that</br>   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave</br>   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,</br>   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone</br>   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who</br>   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad</br>   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,</br>   &quot;Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”</br>   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I</br>   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The</br>   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on</br>   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with</br>   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this</br>   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my</br>   dad after three, four years?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You asked him to take you back?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I begged him.

Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking</br>   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my</br>   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them</br>   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate</br>   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think</br>   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon</br>   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his</br>   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back</br>   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're</br>   human beings.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or</br>   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me</br>   leave the room.

   great. I got to meet a lot of people.<br>

   reading transports you to different places and different languages and<br>

   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,<br>
   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design<br>
   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You<br>
   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her<br>

   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was<br>

I know now. I forgive her, but</br>   certain things … [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.</br>   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this</br>   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her</br>   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She</br>   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot.

I could be</br>   sitting down underneath the table and playing around, and they would be</br>   teaching math and I could learn it. I'm an extremely fast learner—an</br>   extremely fast learner. I think I picked it up by just listening to it, and</br>   the few classes that I had, I picked it up. It was not that hard and I</br>   think at that age it's easier to absorb information, but I think it was</br>   mostly that I'm a quick learner.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did the kids tease you? Were they friendly to you? What was it like</br>   in Miss S. class?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to</br>   me, J___ and— what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good</br>   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of</br>   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher</br>   was not having it … She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of</br>   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some</br>   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They</br>   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a</br>   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is</br>   getting married soon, so yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you bullied?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied</br>   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at</br>   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a</br>   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].</br>   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was</br>   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace</br>   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school</br>   that I had to go to was not a good school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of</br>   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up</br>   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book</br>   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the</br>   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald</br>   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,</br>   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,</br>   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as</br>   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same</br>   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the</br>   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where</br>   you would go and read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In eighth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they</br>   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy</br>   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy</br>   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more</br>   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.</br>   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the</br>   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the</br>   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a</br>   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your</br>   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill</br>   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to</br>   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was</br>   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a</br>   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it</br>   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry</br>   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with</br>   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the</br>   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I</br>   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a</br>   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading</br>   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet</br>   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the</br>   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original</br>   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's</br>   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into</br>   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a</br>   huge reader [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human</br>   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,</br>   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed</br>   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have</br>   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.</br>   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.</br>   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained</br>   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black</br>   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and</br>   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,</br>   historical fiction. I was into everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="c27e784f-4fd7-44c6-846a-ffd01401d420" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Reading">Luisa: Yes.

I switched schools and then I was bullied</br>   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at</br>   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a</br>   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].</br>   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was</br>   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace</br>   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school</br>   that I had to go to was not a good school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of</br>   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up</br>   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book</br>   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the</br>   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald</br>   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,</br>   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,</br>   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as</br>   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same</br>   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the</br>   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where</br>   you would go and read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In eighth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they</br>   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy</br>   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy</br>   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more</br>   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.</br>   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the</br>   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the</br>   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a</br>   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your</br>   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill</br>   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to</br>   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was</br>   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a</br>   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it</br>   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry</br>   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with</br>   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the</br>   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I</br>   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a</br>   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading</br>   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet</br>   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the</br>   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original</br>   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's</br>   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into</br>   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a</br>   huge reader [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human</br>   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,</br>   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed</br>   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have</br>   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.</br>   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.</br>   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained</br>   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black</br>   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and</br>   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,</br>   historical fiction. I was into everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge</br>   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, “are you above the</br>   law? Is anybody above the law?” Yes, I was big on reading. I loved reading</br>   [Chuckles]. Then absurdism. I'm big on reading [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You told me last time about your—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Eighth grade teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R. is the best teacher I have had and he changed my life. Mr. R</br>   is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. [Pause] I had a lot of</br>   teachers that would not … They would question me and they would ... All the</br>   stuff that I would write, they would question if I was okay mentally</br>   because of all this darkness [Chuckles] that I would write about, because a</br>   lot of my stories or a lot of my poetry was extremely dark. I don't think</br>   that's a bad thing you know. I think that's just trying to get rid of the …</br>   it's a catalyst. You're trying to get rid of everything that's inside of</br>   you, and that's how I did it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R was the first one that recognized it as something good. We</br>   still keep in touch—beautiful human being. I knew this. He would speak to</br>   me like we were adults—like I was an adult. I was a thirteen-year-old girl</br>   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was</br>   or what he saw in me, but we had conversations like adults. I would stay</br>   after class for hours just discussing books that he would give me, and he</br>   would give me books out of his collection for me to read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about</br>   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He</br>   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.</br>   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccolò Machiavelli. I</br>   actually have “the end justifies the means” tattooed on me.</br> </br> </br>   It’s tattooed back here. Realism to me was … it's real. Human beings are</br>   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will</br>   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just</br>   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,</br>   if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: But yes, Mr. R was beautiful. He was a lawyer. He was a criminal</br>   lawyer. I'm not sure what kind of lawyer he was, but he hated defending</br>   people who were guilty. That man—oh my God I love that man—he hated it. He</br>   hated defending people who were guilty. There's this program called the</br>   “Golden Apple Program” where you can switch from being whatever it is that</br>   your career is to being a teacher, and it's what he did. Beautiful,</br>   beautiful man.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I</br>   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I</br>   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and</br>   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about</br>   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting. Yes, so Mr. R was</br>   someone beautiful and he taught me that [Pause] life is short and you need</br>   to seize the day. You need to take life by the balls [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting</br>   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because</br>   reading transports you to different places and different languages and</br>   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been</br>   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,</br>   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design</br>   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You</br>   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her</br>   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they</br>   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to</br>   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,</br>   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the</br>   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their</br>   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three</br>   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was</br>   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was</br>   great. I got to meet a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,</br>   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the</br>   attire?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would</br>   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was</br>   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with</br>   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It</br>   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],</br>   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took</br>   over.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: <span id="409da562-c6df-4cae-b71e-d93fd6d017ca" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US">His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican.

  </span> Anita: Last time we spoke, you talked about how difficult it was to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To leave my dad?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... to leave things behind.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Of course. I grew up fairly wealthy in Mexico. I had a big, big</br>   house. I had two German Shepherds that ran around everywhere. I had a</br>   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.</br>   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I</br>   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go</br>   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They</br>   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side. I</br>   would lay and sleep on my dad's chest always. Always, always, always,</br>   always, always, so it was extremely difficult to leave my dad behind the</br>   most. My dad was my world back then. But my dad, my friends, school—school</br>   was great, I loved school [Chuckles]—I had to leave it all behind.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I left, I was six years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The apartment you moved into—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: The apartment that we moved into in California was a one-bedroom</br>   apartment. It was a big complex and I remember it. There was a pool in the</br>   middle and there were a lot of families like us that shared a one-bedroom</br>   apartment. And there were eight to twelve people in this one space, and we</br>   were trying to find something bigger, but it was impossible.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember what your mood was like at that time?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Jarring. It was extremely jarring. From one day to another, the move</br>   was extremely … it was jarring. One day, you have a family and you're</br>   happy, and then the next, you can't even speak the language. You can't</br>   communicate, you don't know where you're at. I felt like my whole world was</br>   tilted to the side.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How soon after getting to California did you move to Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Within three to six months. It didn't take that long … immediately</br>   kind of. I think one of my uncles took it upon himself to take care of us,</br>   and since my mom … my mom at the time, we did not know she had a tumor in</br>   the back of her brain. Right where her brain stem is, she had a huge tumor</br>   there and we had no idea. Nobody knew. She doesn't remember a lot of this.</br>   I don't know if it's because of the emotional trauma or because of the</br>   tumor, but once we got to Chicago, it was evident that something was wrong</br>   with my mother and she started going to the doctor.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Thank God for Cook County Hospital [Chuckles]. They don't charge you</br>   a thing, but she got the medical treatment that she needed. She had brain</br>   surgery. They removed the tumor and she had to be in therapy for a few</br>   years in order to gain … she couldn't talk. She didn't have movement in</br>   half of her face, so she couldn't speak because her tongue was numb on one</br>   side, so she had to have physical therapy. I went with her a couple times</br>   because I had to translate. Sometimes they didn't have people who would</br>   translate for my mother. At this point, I had already learned English, but</br>   she had to practice every single day. Still to this day, there are a few</br>   words that she cannot say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She can't pronounce them or she doesn't remember them?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She can't pronounce them. She'll talk like this [imitates] because</br>   she can't move half of her face.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tumor benign?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, it was benign. Thank God for that. But she had an encounter</br>   with TB and then she was on medication for that. You know what I think it</br>   was? I think that all this negativity affected her [Chuckles], or I don't</br>   know if you believe this, but the law of attraction. I think that she</br>   really did not want to keep going and that affected her quite a bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When did you start going to school, in Chicago or in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I moved to Chicago and that's where I started going to school. I</br>   started going to school at the age of six. Unfortunately, the school that I</br>   went to did not have a bilingual program. I was stuck with Miss S.</br>   [Chuckles]. I'm never going to forget her … Miss S., lovely woman</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that sarcastic?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, [Chuckles] very sarcastic. Did not speak a lick of Spanish. Not</br>   one sentence. I don't think she knew how to pronounce anything, and she was</br>   as WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] as you can get. This woman would get</br>   extremely frustrated with me—extremely—and I didn't know what was going on.</br>   To me, it was a completely … [Disgusted sound] it was mind-boggling how I</br>   could go from—I knew how to read and write in Spanish. I was a pretty smart</br>   kid. I knew how to read and write in Spanish at six years old. So I go into</br>   first grade and I can't even understand what my teachers are saying, so it</br>   was extremely frustrating and this teacher found it extremely frustrating</br>   as well, so she would lay me down face down half the day on the magic</br>   carpet where she would read stories to everyone because she didn't want to</br>   deal with it anymore. I told my mom—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because she didn't want to deal with what?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Deal with me anymore. I guess she didn't know where to put me. She</br>   didn't know what to do with me, she didn't know how to teach me, so her</br>   solution was to put me aside and not have to deal with me, so I had to</br>   pretty much be invisible for half the class. Just put my head down and not</br>   say a word. So I picked up English extremely fast because I had to</br>   [Chuckles]. I had to pick up English very, very, very fast or that was</br>   going to keep happening. I didn't want that to keep happening, so I picked</br>   it up.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I told my mom about this and I remember vividly having a</br>   conversation with her and telling her, &quot;Hey, you know what? This is</br>   happening at school,&quot; but I think my mom was going through so much stuff</br>   that she didn't know how to deal with it or she didn't … there wasn't</br>   enough of my mom to go around back then. I know now. I forgive her, but</br>   certain things … [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.</br>   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this</br>   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her</br>   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She</br>   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She</br>   started going to design school for designing clothes and it’s pretty great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in one second. If you were lying face down on</br>   the magic carpet all day, how did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was there for half the day, and this is something that I'm going</br>   to tell you that my teachers had told me in kindergarten. I could be</br>   sitting down underneath the table and playing around, and they would be</br>   teaching math and I could learn it. I'm an extremely fast learner—an</br>   extremely fast learner. I think I picked it up by just listening to it, and</br>   the few classes that I had, I picked it up. It was not that hard and I</br>   think at that age it's easier to absorb information, but I think it was</br>   mostly that I'm a quick learner.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did the kids tease you? Were they friendly to you? What was it like</br>   in Miss S. class?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to</br>   me, J___ and— what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good</br>   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of</br>   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher</br>   was not having it … She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of</br>   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some</br>   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They</br>   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a</br>   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is</br>   getting married soon, so yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you bullied?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied</br>   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at</br>   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a</br>   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].</br>   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was</br>   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace</br>   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school</br>   that I had to go to was not a good school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of</br>   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up</br>   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book</br>   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the</br>   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald</br>   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,</br>   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,</br>   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as</br>   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same</br>   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the</br>   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where</br>   you would go and read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In eighth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they</br>   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy</br>   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy</br>   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more</br>   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.</br>   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the</br>   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the</br>   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a</br>   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your</br>   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill</br>   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to</br>   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was</br>   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a</br>   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it</br>   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry</br>   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with</br>   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the</br>   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I</br>   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a</br>   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading</br>   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet</br>   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the</br>   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original</br>   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's</br>   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into</br>   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a</br>   huge reader [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human</br>   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,</br>   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed</br>   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have</br>   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.</br>   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.</br>   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained</br>   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black</br>   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and</br>   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,</br>   historical fiction. I was into everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge</br>   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, “are you above the</br>   law? Is anybody above the law?” Yes, I was big on reading. I loved reading</br>   [Chuckles]. Then absurdism. I'm big on reading [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You told me last time about your—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Eighth grade teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R. is the best teacher I have had and he changed my life. Mr. R</br>   is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. [Pause] I had a lot of</br>   teachers that would not … They would question me and they would ... All the</br>   stuff that I would write, they would question if I was okay mentally</br>   because of all this darkness [Chuckles] that I would write about, because a</br>   lot of my stories or a lot of my poetry was extremely dark. I don't think</br>   that's a bad thing you know. I think that's just trying to get rid of the …</br>   it's a catalyst. You're trying to get rid of everything that's inside of</br>   you, and that's how I did it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R was the first one that recognized it as something good. We</br>   still keep in touch—beautiful human being. I knew this. He would speak to</br>   me like we were adults—like I was an adult. I was a thirteen-year-old girl</br>   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was</br>   or what he saw in me, but we had conversations like adults. I would stay</br>   after class for hours just discussing books that he would give me, and he</br>   would give me books out of his collection for me to read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about</br>   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He</br>   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.</br>   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccolò Machiavelli. I</br>   actually have “the end justifies the means” tattooed on me.</br> </br> </br>   It’s tattooed back here. Realism to me was … it's real. Human beings are</br>   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will</br>   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just</br>   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,</br>   if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: But yes, Mr. R was beautiful. He was a lawyer. He was a criminal</br>   lawyer. I'm not sure what kind of lawyer he was, but he hated defending</br>   people who were guilty. That man—oh my God I love that man—he hated it. He</br>   hated defending people who were guilty. There's this program called the</br>   “Golden Apple Program” where you can switch from being whatever it is that</br>   your career is to being a teacher, and it's what he did. Beautiful,</br>   beautiful man.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I</br>   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I</br>   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and</br>   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about</br>   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting. Yes, so Mr. R was</br>   someone beautiful and he taught me that [Pause] life is short and you need</br>   to seize the day. You need to take life by the balls [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting</br>   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because</br>   reading transports you to different places and different languages and</br>   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been</br>   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,</br>   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design</br>   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You</br>   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her</br>   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they</br>   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to</br>   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,</br>   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the</br>   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their</br>   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three</br>   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was</br>   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was</br>   great. I got to meet a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,</br>   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the</br>   attire?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would</br>   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was</br>   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with</br>   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It</br>   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],</br>   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took</br>   over.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he</br>   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to</br>   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would</br>   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, &quot;Oh, my God. What's</br>   happening?&quot; But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually</br>   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,</br>   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.</br>   They were great people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something you said yesterday that you said you didn't tell me about</br>   was something about adoption.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting</br>   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the</br>   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not</br>   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the</br>   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be</br>   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our</br>   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for</br>   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put</br>   a huge stop to that and was like, &quot;That's not happening. You're stupid.</br>   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was going to be a family member, not a close family member, but</br>   these were the lengths that you go through to try to get through this. I</br>   didn't have a normal childhood. I never got to learn to drive. I didn't go</br>   to drivers ed. I didn't get to travel with my best friend to DisneyLand</br>   because my mom was so scared of—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more</br>   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that</br>   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave</br>   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,</br>   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone</br>   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who</br>   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad</br>   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,</br>   &quot;Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”</br>   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I</br>   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The</br>   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on</br>   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with</br>   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this</br>   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my</br>   dad after three, four years?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You asked him to take you back?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't</br>   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, &quot;No,</br>   that's not happening with us.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking</br>   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my</br>   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them</br>   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate</br>   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think</br>   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon</br>   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his</br>   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back</br>   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're</br>   human beings.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or</br>   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me</br>   leave the room. She was like, &quot;I can't see you right now. Leave the room.</br>   You're so much like your dad. Leave.&quot; It really affected her. I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about being undocumented. When did you know? What was it</br>   like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just … I</br>   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my</br>   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things</br>   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family</br>   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.</br>   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good</br>   stories from him. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me—and I mean</br>   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every</br>   single day at her home or her grandparents’ home. If my mom couldn't find</br>   me, she'd call L___’s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my</br>   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, &quot;Hey. Could you</br>   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have</br>   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.&quot; All family events I</br>   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.</br>   We were best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks</br>   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared</br>   like a deer in the headlights. “No, I'm not. I'm not.” I was so scared of</br>   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody—an ex-girlfriend, I think</br>   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we</br>   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we</br>   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So</br>   I was not allowed to tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of</br>   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed</br>   to tell this? This is a secret and—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.</br>   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty</br>   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I</br>   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science</br>   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not</br>   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you</br>   if you're an American citizen or not.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, &quot;I am</br>   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.&quot; She was put</br>   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in</br>   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm</br>   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody</br>   ever knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected</br>   your life. Can you talk about that too?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire</br>   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that</br>   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to</br>   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't</br>   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You</br>   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you</br>   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd</br>   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled</br>   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What</br>   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing</br>   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the</br>   shadows. Nobody really knows.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You used a metaphor --</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in</br>   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're</br>   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in</br>   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but</br>   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being</br>   in a golden cage.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did being undocumented affect your education?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented affected my education. The first time was when I</br>   wanted to apply to Whitney Young—when I wanted to go to a different high</br>   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for</br>   it, but they were asking … I don't remember what kind of document they were</br>   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, &quot;You know</br>   what? Let’s not. I don't want to. It's not worth it if I get deported. I</br>   don't need to be—it's not necessary.&quot; So I went to my local high school,</br>   which … not the best high school, Washington High School, but they had the</br>   IB program.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd you want to go to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my</br>   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my</br>   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm</br>   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't</br>   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated</br>   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in</br>   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, &quot;Ugh. What</br>   am I supposed to do with you?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is</br>   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I</br>   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.</br>   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.</br>   I think the problem with human beings is that you’re your only true enemy.</br>   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you</br>   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,</br>   sniffles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.</br>   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid</br>   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because</br>   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't</br>   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get</br>   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].</br>   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on</br>   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn</br>   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then</br>   [Chuckles] I sculpted something—a huge tiger—and I turned it in and it was</br>   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one</br>   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still</br>   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to get into a good university. I was like, &quot;Okay, high</br>   school's fine. Okay, whatever. We're going to make do. I'm going to be the</br>   best student wherever I am.&quot; So I started swimming, track, volleyball,</br>   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it</br>   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a</br>   bunch of community work—I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog</br>   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,</br>   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,</br>   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't</br>   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted</br>   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my</br>   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I</br>   was like, &quot;Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this.&quot; I wanted to be an</br>   oncologist—yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't</br>   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want</br>   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in</br>   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was set to go into a good future. That's what it was, but when it</br>   came down to it, my mom was like, &quot;No. You know what? You can't. You don't</br>   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to</br>   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your</br>   books. Each book, that's like $5000 for books. We can't do that. I'm</br>   sorry.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, and that's when it had come out. Right when I had graduated</br>   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel</br>   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, &quot;You know what?</br>   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of</br>   us.&quot; But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or</br>   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government. That they're</br>   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where</br>   you live and who lives with you and where you are. I don't want that, and</br>   she did not allow that. I know. I know. I could've, but I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you fight?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My mom? No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just accepted it?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Yes and no. It took me a while. I was even going to marry my</br>   best friend, E___. I was like, &quot;Let's get married. Let's get married.&quot; He</br>   was my best friend, but he didn't know why I wanted to get married</br>   [Laughs]. In my mind, I was like, &quot;Fuck it. Let's do this. I'll get papers</br>   and I'll continue my education. That's fine. Once we're married, he's stuck</br>   with me. I'll tell him then.” [Pause] I even thought about that. I was</br>   getting extremely desperate, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did E___ think? What did he think?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I told him I was moving to Mexico, he offered to marry me too</br>   so I would stay behind. I think he kind of knew at that point. I think E___</br>   knew. He wasn't a stupid guy. He called my mom mommy. He wasn't stupid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You returned to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I made the decision of returning, and I uprooted my sisters. My</br>   little sister was a year old when we left. She knew nothing about Mexico.</br>   She barely spoke Spanish, so I selfishly made everyone move back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Because I wanted to continue my education.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why didn't they stay behind?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I think my mom felt guilty. I think she didn't want me to be by</br>   myself. She felt guilty that she didn't allow me to apply for DACA, so</br>   she's like, &quot;Okay. That's okay.&quot; Eventually my sisters are going to have to</br>   go through this and let's do it now so the change doesn't hurt them as much</br>   when it comes down to it. They had it a little easier, I think [Chuckles].</br>   They didn't have to go through it twice, or maybe that's just my</br>   bitterness, but I had to go through that uprooting and going into a strange</br>   country twice [Chuckles]. They don't remember Mexico at all, so I don't</br>   think they remember any of the life that we had here.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I do. I remember my dogs. I remember my mom. I remember my dad. I</br>   remember my grandparents. I remember everything, and they didn't remember</br>   anything. Their entire life was over there, so that's just my bitterness.</br>   We moved back and I was so depressed. I don't think I've ever been that</br>   depressed in my life. I had to go back to high school because … even with</br>   the IB program. I killed myself. What was that worth, all that effort, and</br>   all that [Chokes up]? What was it worth? Nothing. I had to go back to this</br>   broken education system in Mexico which I could run laps around the fucking</br>   curriculum and I had to redo it in order to go to university, and fuck,</br>   that sucked.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was extremely depressed. I didn't even want to leave the house</br>   because I didn't want to be reminded of the fact that I was not in the</br>   States anymore, because it was ugly. It was ugly where we lived.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was school like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Hard at first. I was bullied at first. I remember … because my</br>   Spanish wasn't the best. When I got here, I had not practiced my Spanish in</br>   so long. I knew how to read and write, but my grammar was not the best</br>   either. I had kindergarten education. That's how long I [Chuckles] …</br>   everything else, a lot of my teachers were understanding. My literature</br>   teacher was extremely understanding. I thank him for that. He was the one</br>   that asked me to write and I wrote a short story about a sparrow getting</br>   lost in the snow and then turning up in the jungle, and the sparrow makes</br>   friends with all the cockatoos and the snake and the anaconda and they're</br>   all bros and he learns to speak their language—not very well, but he</br>   learns.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: The sparrow gets old and keeps living there and he's like, &quot;You know</br>   what? I love this place and I love my friends, and even though it kills me</br>   to leave all my friends behind here in the jungle, I need to go back to my</br>   home,&quot; [Chokes up] so the sparrow makes his journey and he dies. He makes</br>   it to the snow and he dies looking at the tree where he had his nest.</br>   [Crying] My literature teacher I think was pretty impacted by that. He was</br>   pretty understanding.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the snow Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I miss the snow like crazy [Continues crying]. I remember the</br>   first Christmas we spent here was … It didn't feel like Christmas. It did</br>   not feel like Christmas. It felt weird. I wasn't used to it. [Pause] I gave</br>   that to the teacher. The teacher published it. My literature teacher was</br>   extremely well known in the community. He's world renowned, I think,</br>   because he is the host for the International Poets Meeting. He's the host,</br>   so I'm pretty sure he's well known in the literature world, and he</br>   published a lot of my poetry too because I had a lot of poetry—and in</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He understood English and he would tear up with a lot of the stuff</br>   that I would give him. Very, very understanding, but we bonded over</br>   literature because he was extremely, extremely into books.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like Mr. R?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Like Mr. R, yes. R___, that's his name.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. He was pretty great. He would talk about philosophy. He helped</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [So you studied international relations] Why international</br>   relations?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: International relations because I am a fucking citizen of the world.</br>   Every time somebody asks me, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; I have no idea how to</br>   answer because I don't feel Mexican and I don't feel American. I don't know</br>   what I am, so fuck it. I'm going to be a citizen of the world [Chuckles].</br>   I'm going to take all of this and I'm going to be international. That's it.</br>   That's it. We're going to be international. That's it, because genuinely,</br>   honest to God, I don't know how to answer when somebody asks me.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you've seen when they've asked me, &quot;Where are you</br>   from?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;Where was I born? Where was I raised? Where's my</br>   family from? Where do I live? What do you want to know?” Because “where are</br>   you from?” is a very loaded question to me. It's a lot about identity, and</br>   I think a human being needs this [Pause] identity, this sense of belonging,</br>   and I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't feel like I have a home.</br>   Like a real one. At this point, I think my home is my partner and that</br>   scares the shit out of me [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I've thought about it. I've thought about it a lot [Chuckles]. It</br>   scares me because he has become my home. He's helped me through a lot. He's</br>   helped me get through a lot of traumas. He's helped me stand up to my</br>   father because I was not able to have a conversation with him. I was not</br>   able to say no to my dad [Sniffles]. I always wanted to please my dad</br>   because I never had him in my life, so I wanted him to be happy with me</br>   now. He's helped me a lot, so scary shit [Chuckles]. I don't like thinking</br>   about it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only two more questions that are more reflective.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: One is this idea about what did the US lose by losing someone like</br>   you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm pretty sure if I wasn't going to be an oncologist, maybe a</br>   neuroscientist or a neurosurgeon. People like me, I'm driven, man. I'm</br>   extremely driven. When you grow up with all of these people telling you</br>   that you can't, you want it more and you want it more and you have this</br>   hunger inside of you that you want it and you need it and you're going to</br>   make it, and I'm pretty sure I could run laps around all these fuckers that</br>   were born citizens. So they did—they lost somebody who can better society.</br>   I'm pretty sure I had a lot to offer … in a lot of senses.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What has Mexico gained by gaining you?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="e400e46f-0fef-4ee6-92d9-5ebd98ffbcff" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Mexico, Before the US">Luisa: I think they've gained a lot.

   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and<br>
   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,<br>

   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up<br>
   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book<br>
   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the<br>
   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald<br>
   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,<br>
   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,<br>
   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as<br>

One of my uncles got the opportunity to move to</br>   Chicago—a job opportunity—so he moved. I think after my parents divorced,</br>   all of my uncles saw us as their kids, because two of the ones that really</br>   took care of us never really had kids, so they loved us and they brought us</br>   in.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: We moved to Chicago with my grandparents because my grandparents</br>   were my second parents by this point. My mother is the eldest—she took care</br>   of seven of my grandparents’ children, so my grandmother really, really</br>   loves my mother. We moved to Chicago to an apartment on Green Bay on the</br>   East Side, and that's how it went.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let me ask you a few questions going backwards. Was there any</br>   domestic abuse in your family?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: With my parents? My mother, yes. She doesn't like to talk about it.</br>   The older I get, the more she opens up, but it's not something that she</br>   likes to talk about. It was never in front of us, it was behind closed</br>   doors. I thank my father. He's a piece of shit, but I thank him for at</br>   least having the thought of not wanting to traumatize us. So yes, it was</br>   behind closed doors, but the more I get out of my mom, it was a lot of</br>   emotional abuse as well, a lot. I think there was some physical abuse. My</br>   mom's never touched upon it, but that's what happened. And then we got to</br>   Chicago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time we spoke, you talked about how difficult it was to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To leave my dad?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... to leave things behind.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Of course. I grew up fairly wealthy in Mexico. I had a big, big</br>   house. I had two German Shepherds that ran around everywhere. I had a</br>   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.</br>   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I</br>   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go</br>   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They</br>   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side. I</br>   would lay and sleep on my dad's chest always. Always, always, always,</br>   always, always, so it was extremely difficult to leave my dad behind the</br>   most. My dad was my world back then. But my dad, my friends, school—school</br>   was great, I loved school [Chuckles]—I had to leave it all behind.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I left, I was six years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The apartment you moved into—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: The apartment that we moved into in California was a one-bedroom</br>   apartment. It was a big complex and I remember it. There was a pool in the</br>   middle and there were a lot of families like us that shared a one-bedroom</br>   apartment. And there were eight to twelve people in this one space, and we</br>   were trying to find something bigger, but it was impossible.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember what your mood was like at that time?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Jarring. It was extremely jarring. From one day to another, the move</br>   was extremely … it was jarring. One day, you have a family and you're</br>   happy, and then the next, you can't even speak the language. You can't</br>   communicate, you don't know where you're at. I felt like my whole world was</br>   tilted to the side.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How soon after getting to California did you move to Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Within three to six months. It didn't take that long … immediately</br>   kind of. I think one of my uncles took it upon himself to take care of us,</br>   and since my mom … my mom at the time, we did not know she had a tumor in</br>   the back of her brain. Right where her brain stem is, she had a huge tumor</br>   there and we had no idea. Nobody knew. She doesn't remember a lot of this.</br>   I don't know if it's because of the emotional trauma or because of the</br>   tumor, but once we got to Chicago, it was evident that something was wrong</br>   with my mother and she started going to the doctor.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Thank God for Cook County Hospital [Chuckles]. They don't charge you</br>   a thing, but she got the medical treatment that she needed. She had brain</br>   surgery. They removed the tumor and she had to be in therapy for a few</br>   years in order to gain … she couldn't talk. She didn't have movement in</br>   half of her face, so she couldn't speak because her tongue was numb on one</br>   side, so she had to have physical therapy. I went with her a couple times</br>   because I had to translate. Sometimes they didn't have people who would</br>   translate for my mother. At this point, I had already learned English, but</br>   she had to practice every single day. Still to this day, there are a few</br>   words that she cannot say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She can't pronounce them or she doesn't remember them?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She can't pronounce them. She'll talk like this [imitates] because</br>   she can't move half of her face.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tumor benign?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, it was benign. Thank God for that. But she had an encounter</br>   with TB and then she was on medication for that. You know what I think it</br>   was? I think that all this negativity affected her [Chuckles], or I don't</br>   know if you believe this, but the law of attraction. I think that she</br>   really did not want to keep going and that affected her quite a bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When did you start going to school, in Chicago or in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I moved to Chicago and that's where I started going to school. I</br>   started going to school at the age of six. Unfortunately, the school that I</br>   went to did not have a bilingual program. I was stuck with Miss S.</br>   [Chuckles]. I'm never going to forget her … Miss S., lovely woman</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that sarcastic?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, [Chuckles] very sarcastic. Did not speak a lick of Spanish. Not</br>   one sentence. I don't think she knew how to pronounce anything, and she was</br>   as WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] as you can get. This woman would get</br>   extremely frustrated with me—extremely—and I didn't know what was going on.</br>   To me, it was a completely … [Disgusted sound] it was mind-boggling how I</br>   could go from—I knew how to read and write in Spanish. I was a pretty smart</br>   kid. I knew how to read and write in Spanish at six years old. So I go into</br>   first grade and I can't even understand what my teachers are saying, so it</br>   was extremely frustrating and this teacher found it extremely frustrating</br>   as well, so she would lay me down face down half the day on the magic</br>   carpet where she would read stories to everyone because she didn't want to</br>   deal with it anymore. I told my mom—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because she didn't want to deal with what?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Deal with me anymore. I guess she didn't know where to put me. She</br>   didn't know what to do with me, she didn't know how to teach me, so her</br>   solution was to put me aside and not have to deal with me, so I had to</br>   pretty much be invisible for half the class. Just put my head down and not</br>   say a word. So I picked up English extremely fast because I had to</br>   [Chuckles]. I had to pick up English very, very, very fast or that was</br>   going to keep happening. I didn't want that to keep happening, so I picked</br>   it up.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I told my mom about this and I remember vividly having a</br>   conversation with her and telling her, &quot;Hey, you know what? This is</br>   happening at school,&quot; but I think my mom was going through so much stuff</br>   that she didn't know how to deal with it or she didn't … there wasn't</br>   enough of my mom to go around back then. I know now. I forgive her, but</br>   certain things … [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.</br>   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this</br>   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her</br>   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She</br>   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She</br>   started going to design school for designing clothes and it’s pretty great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in one second. If you were lying face down on</br>   the magic carpet all day, how did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was there for half the day, and this is something that I'm going</br>   to tell you that my teachers had told me in kindergarten. I could be</br>   sitting down underneath the table and playing around, and they would be</br>   teaching math and I could learn it. I'm an extremely fast learner—an</br>   extremely fast learner. I think I picked it up by just listening to it, and</br>   the few classes that I had, I picked it up. It was not that hard and I</br>   think at that age it's easier to absorb information, but I think it was</br>   mostly that I'm a quick learner.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did the kids tease you? Were they friendly to you? What was it like</br>   in Miss S. class?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to</br>   me, J___ and— what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good</br>   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of</br>   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher</br>   was not having it … She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of</br>   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some</br>   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They</br>   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a</br>   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is</br>   getting married soon, so yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you bullied?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied</br>   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at</br>   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a</br>   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].</br>   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was</br>   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace</br>   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school</br>   that I had to go to was not a good school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of</br>   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up</br>   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book</br>   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the</br>   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald</br>   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,</br>   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,</br>   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as</br>   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same</br>   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the</br>   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where</br>   you would go and read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In eighth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they</br>   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy</br>   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy</br>   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more</br>   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.</br>   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the</br>   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the</br>   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a</br>   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your</br>   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill</br>   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to</br>   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was</br>   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a</br>   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it</br>   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry</br>   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with</br>   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the</br>   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I</br>   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a</br>   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading</br>   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet</br>   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the</br>   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original</br>   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's</br>   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into</br>   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a</br>   huge reader [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human</br>   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,</br>   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed</br>   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have</br>   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.</br>   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.</br>   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained</br>   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black</br>   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and</br>   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,</br>   historical fiction. I was into everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge</br>   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, “are you above the</br>   law? Is anybody above the law?” Yes, I was big on reading. I loved reading</br>   [Chuckles]. Then absurdism. I'm big on reading [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You told me last time about your—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Eighth grade teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R. is the best teacher I have had and he changed my life. Mr. R</br>   is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. [Pause] I had a lot of</br>   teachers that would not … They would question me and they would ... All the</br>   stuff that I would write, they would question if I was okay mentally</br>   because of all this darkness [Chuckles] that I would write about, because a</br>   lot of my stories or a lot of my poetry was extremely dark. I don't think</br>   that's a bad thing you know. I think that's just trying to get rid of the …</br>   it's a catalyst. You're trying to get rid of everything that's inside of</br>   you, and that's how I did it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R was the first one that recognized it as something good. We</br>   still keep in touch—beautiful human being. I knew this. He would speak to</br>   me like we were adults—like I was an adult. I was a thirteen-year-old girl</br>   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was</br>   or what he saw in me, but we had conversations like adults. I would stay</br>   after class for hours just discussing books that he would give me, and he</br>   would give me books out of his collection for me to read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about</br>   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He</br>   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.</br>   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccolò Machiavelli. I</br>   actually have “the end justifies the means” tattooed on me.</br> </br> </br>   It’s tattooed back here. Realism to me was … it's real. Human beings are</br>   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will</br>   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just</br>   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,</br>   if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: But yes, Mr. R was beautiful. He was a lawyer. He was a criminal</br>   lawyer. I'm not sure what kind of lawyer he was, but he hated defending</br>   people who were guilty. That man—oh my God I love that man—he hated it. He</br>   hated defending people who were guilty. There's this program called the</br>   “Golden Apple Program” where you can switch from being whatever it is that</br>   your career is to being a teacher, and it's what he did. Beautiful,</br>   beautiful man.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I</br>   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I</br>   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and</br>   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about</br>   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting. Yes, so Mr. R was</br>   someone beautiful and he taught me that [Pause] life is short and you need</br>   to seize the day. You need to take life by the balls [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting</br>   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because</br>   reading transports you to different places and different languages and</br>   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been</br>   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,</br>   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design</br>   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You</br>   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her</br>   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they</br>   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to</br>   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,</br>   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the</br>   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their</br>   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three</br>   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was</br>   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was</br>   great. I got to meet a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,</br>   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the</br>   attire?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would</br>   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was</br>   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with</br>   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It</br>   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],</br>   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took</br>   over.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he</br>   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to</br>   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would</br>   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, &quot;Oh, my God. What's</br>   happening?&quot; But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually</br>   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,</br>   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.</br>   They were great people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something you said yesterday that you said you didn't tell me about</br>   was something about adoption.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting</br>   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the</br>   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not</br>   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the</br>   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be</br>   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our</br>   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for</br>   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put</br>   a huge stop to that and was like, &quot;That's not happening. You're stupid.</br>   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was going to be a family member, not a close family member, but</br>   these were the lengths that you go through to try to get through this. I</br>   didn't have a normal childhood. I never got to learn to drive. I didn't go</br>   to drivers ed. I didn't get to travel with my best friend to DisneyLand</br>   because my mom was so scared of—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more</br>   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that</br>   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: <span id="b928c119-9699-495c-bf12-b6a4ad4cc905" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US">Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us.

   my mom just shaved it off and her name was Jose now, and it was a game. I<br>
   didn't know what was happening, of course. We arrived to ____ California.<br>
   We arrived at an apartment that we were sharing with about eight other<br>
   people—my grandparents, my sisters and I, my mother, my uncles, then<br>
   eventually my uncle's wife.</span> One of my uncles got the opportunity to move to</br>   Chicago—a job opportunity—so he moved. I think after my parents divorced,</br>   all of my uncles saw us as their kids, because two of the ones that really</br>   took care of us never really had kids, so they loved us and they brought us</br>   in.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: We moved to Chicago with my grandparents because my grandparents</br>   were my second parents by this point. My mother is the eldest—she took care</br>   of seven of my grandparents’ children, so my grandmother really, really</br>   loves my mother. We moved to Chicago to an apartment on Green Bay on the</br>   East Side, and that's how it went.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let me ask you a few questions going backwards. Was there any</br>   domestic abuse in your family?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: With my parents? My mother, yes. She doesn't like to talk about it.</br>   The older I get, the more she opens up, but it's not something that she</br>   likes to talk about. It was never in front of us, it was behind closed</br>   doors. I thank my father. He's a piece of shit, but I thank him for at</br>   least having the thought of not wanting to traumatize us. So yes, it was</br>   behind closed doors, but the more I get out of my mom, it was a lot of</br>   emotional abuse as well, a lot. I think there was some physical abuse. My</br>   mom's never touched upon it, but that's what happened. And then we got to</br>   Chicago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time we spoke, you talked about how difficult it was to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To leave my dad?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... to leave things behind.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Of course. I grew up fairly wealthy in Mexico. I had a big, big</br>   house. I had two German Shepherds that ran around everywhere. I had a</br>   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.</br>   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I</br>   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go</br>   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They</br>   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side. I</br>   would lay and sleep on my dad's chest always. Always, always, always,</br>   always, always, so it was extremely difficult to leave my dad behind the</br>   most. My dad was my world back then.

I think one of my uncles took it upon himself to take care of us,</br>   and since my mom … my mom at the time, we did not know she had a tumor in</br>   the back of her brain. Right where her brain stem is, she had a huge tumor</br>   there and we had no idea. Nobody knew. She doesn't remember a lot of this.</br>   I don't know if it's because of the emotional trauma or because of the</br>   tumor, but once we got to Chicago, it was evident that something was wrong</br>   with my mother and she started going to the doctor.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Thank God for Cook County Hospital [Chuckles]. They don't charge you</br>   a thing, but she got the medical treatment that she needed. She had brain</br>   surgery. They removed the tumor and she had to be in therapy for a few</br>   years in order to gain … she couldn't talk. She didn't have movement in</br>   half of her face, so she couldn't speak because her tongue was numb on one</br>   side, so she had to have physical therapy. I went with her a couple times</br>   because I had to translate. Sometimes they didn't have people who would</br>   translate for my mother. At this point, I had already learned English, but</br>   she had to practice every single day. Still to this day, there are a few</br>   words that she cannot say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She can't pronounce them or she doesn't remember them?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She can't pronounce them. She'll talk like this [imitates] because</br>   she can't move half of her face.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tumor benign?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, it was benign. Thank God for that. But she had an encounter</br>   with TB and then she was on medication for that. You know what I think it</br>   was? I think that all this negativity affected her [Chuckles], or I don't</br>   know if you believe this, but the law of attraction. I think that she</br>   really did not want to keep going and that affected her quite a bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When did you start going to school, in Chicago or in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I moved to Chicago and that's where I started going to school. I</br>   started going to school at the age of six. Unfortunately, the school that I</br>   went to did not have a bilingual program. I was stuck with Miss S.</br>   [Chuckles]. I'm never going to forget her … Miss S., lovely woman</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that sarcastic?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, [Chuckles] very sarcastic. Did not speak a lick of Spanish. Not</br>   one sentence. I don't think she knew how to pronounce anything, and she was</br>   as WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] as you can get. This woman would get</br>   extremely frustrated with me—extremely—and I didn't know what was going on.</br>   To me, it was a completely … [Disgusted sound] it was mind-boggling how I</br>   could go from—I knew how to read and write in Spanish. I was a pretty smart</br>   kid. I knew how to read and write in Spanish at six years old. So I go into</br>   first grade and I can't even understand what my teachers are saying, so it</br>   was extremely frustrating and this teacher found it extremely frustrating</br>   as well, so she would lay me down face down half the day on the magic</br>   carpet where she would read stories to everyone because she didn't want to</br>   deal with it anymore. I told my mom—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because she didn't want to deal with what?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Deal with me anymore. I guess she didn't know where to put me. She</br>   didn't know what to do with me, she didn't know how to teach me, so her</br>   solution was to put me aside and not have to deal with me, so I had to</br>   pretty much be invisible for half the class. Just put my head down and not</br>   say a word. So I picked up English extremely fast because I had to</br>   [Chuckles]. I had to pick up English very, very, very fast or that was</br>   going to keep happening. I didn't want that to keep happening, so I picked</br>   it up.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I told my mom about this and I remember vividly having a</br>   conversation with her and telling her, &quot;Hey, you know what? This is</br>   happening at school,&quot; but I think my mom was going through so much stuff</br>   that she didn't know how to deal with it or she didn't … there wasn't</br>   enough of my mom to go around back then. I know now. I forgive her, but</br>   certain things … [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.</br>   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this</br>   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her</br>   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She</br>   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She</br>   started going to design school for designing clothes and it’s pretty great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in one second. If you were lying face down on</br>   the magic carpet all day, how did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was there for half the day, and this is something that I'm going</br>   to tell you that my teachers had told me in kindergarten. I could be</br>   sitting down underneath the table and playing around, and they would be</br>   teaching math and I could learn it. I'm an extremely fast learner—an</br>   extremely fast learner. I think I picked it up by just listening to it, and</br>   the few classes that I had, I picked it up. It was not that hard and I</br>   think at that age it's easier to absorb information, but I think it was</br>   mostly that I'm a quick learner.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did the kids tease you? Were they friendly to you? What was it like</br>   in Miss S. class?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to</br>   me, J___ and— what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good</br>   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of</br>   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher</br>   was not having it … She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of</br>   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some</br>   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They</br>   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a</br>   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is</br>   getting married soon, so yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you bullied?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied</br>   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at</br>   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a</br>   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].</br>   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was</br>   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace</br>   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school</br>   that I had to go to was not a good school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of</br>   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up</br>   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book</br>   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the</br>   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald</br>   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,</br>   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,</br>   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as</br>   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same</br>   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the</br>   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where</br>   you would go and read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In eighth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they</br>   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy</br>   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy</br>   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more</br>   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.</br>   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the</br>   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the</br>   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a</br>   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your</br>   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill</br>   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to</br>   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was</br>   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a</br>   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it</br>   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry</br>   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with</br>   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the</br>   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I</br>   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a</br>   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading</br>   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet</br>   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the</br>   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original</br>   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's</br>   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into</br>   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a</br>   huge reader [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human</br>   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,</br>   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed</br>   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have</br>   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.</br>   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.</br>   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained</br>   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black</br>   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and</br>   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,</br>   historical fiction. I was into everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge</br>   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, “are you above the</br>   law? Is anybody above the law?” Yes, I was big on reading. I loved reading</br>   [Chuckles]. Then absurdism. I'm big on reading [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You told me last time about your—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Eighth grade teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R. is the best teacher I have had and he changed my life. Mr. R</br>   is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. [Pause] I had a lot of</br>   teachers that would not … They would question me and they would ... All the</br>   stuff that I would write, they would question if I was okay mentally</br>   because of all this darkness [Chuckles] that I would write about, because a</br>   lot of my stories or a lot of my poetry was extremely dark. I don't think</br>   that's a bad thing you know. I think that's just trying to get rid of the …</br>   it's a catalyst. You're trying to get rid of everything that's inside of</br>   you, and that's how I did it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R was the first one that recognized it as something good. We</br>   still keep in touch—beautiful human being. I knew this. He would speak to</br>   me like we were adults—like I was an adult. I was a thirteen-year-old girl</br>   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was</br>   or what he saw in me, but we had conversations like adults. I would stay</br>   after class for hours just discussing books that he would give me, and he</br>   would give me books out of his collection for me to read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about</br>   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He</br>   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.</br>   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccolò Machiavelli. I</br>   actually have “the end justifies the means” tattooed on me.</br> </br> </br>   It’s tattooed back here. Realism to me was … it's real. Human beings are</br>   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will</br>   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just</br>   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,</br>   if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: But yes, Mr. R was beautiful. He was a lawyer. He was a criminal</br>   lawyer. I'm not sure what kind of lawyer he was, but he hated defending</br>   people who were guilty. That man—oh my God I love that man—he hated it. He</br>   hated defending people who were guilty. There's this program called the</br>   “Golden Apple Program” where you can switch from being whatever it is that</br>   your career is to being a teacher, and it's what he did. Beautiful,</br>   beautiful man.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I</br>   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I</br>   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and</br>   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about</br>   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting. Yes, so Mr. R was</br>   someone beautiful and he taught me that [Pause] life is short and you need</br>   to seize the day. You need to take life by the balls [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting</br>   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because</br>   reading transports you to different places and different languages and</br>   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been</br>   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,</br>   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design</br>   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You</br>   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her</br>   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they</br>   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to</br>   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,</br>   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the</br>   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their</br>   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three</br>   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was</br>   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was</br>   great. I got to meet a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,</br>   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the</br>   attire?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would</br>   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was</br>   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with</br>   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It</br>   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],</br>   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took</br>   over.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he</br>   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to</br>   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would</br>   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, &quot;Oh, my God. What's</br>   happening?&quot; But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually</br>   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,</br>   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.</br>   They were great people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something you said yesterday that you said you didn't tell me about</br>   was something about adoption.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting</br>   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the</br>   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not</br>   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the</br>   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be</br>   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our</br>   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for</br>   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put</br>   a huge stop to that and was like, &quot;That's not happening. You're stupid.</br>   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was going to be a family member, not a close family member, but</br>   these were the lengths that you go through to try to get through this. I</br>   didn't have a normal childhood. I never got to learn to drive. I didn't go</br>   to drivers ed. I didn't get to travel with my best friend to DisneyLand</br>   because my mom was so scared of—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more</br>   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that</br>   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave</br>   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,</br>   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone</br>   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who</br>   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad</br>   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,</br>   &quot;Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”</br>   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I</br>   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The</br>   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on</br>   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with</br>   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this</br>   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my</br>   dad after three, four years?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You asked him to take you back?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't</br>   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, &quot;No,</br>   that's not happening with us.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking</br>   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my</br>   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them</br>   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate</br>   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think</br>   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon</br>   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his</br>   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back</br>   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're</br>   human beings.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or</br>   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me</br>   leave the room. She was like, &quot;I can't see you right now. Leave the room.</br>   You're so much like your dad. Leave.&quot; It really affected her. I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about being undocumented. When did you know? What was it</br>   like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just … I</br>   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my</br>   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things</br>   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family</br>   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.</br>   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good</br>   stories from him. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me—and I mean</br>   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every</br>   single day at her home or her grandparents’ home. If my mom couldn't find</br>   me, she'd call L___’s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my</br>   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, &quot;Hey. Could you</br>   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have</br>   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.&quot; All family events I</br>   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.</br>   We were best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks</br>   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared</br>   like a deer in the headlights. “No, I'm not. I'm not.” I was so scared of</br>   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody—an ex-girlfriend, I think</br>   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we</br>   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we</br>   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So</br>   I was not allowed to tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of</br>   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed</br>   to tell this? This is a secret and—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.</br>   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty</br>   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I</br>   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science</br>   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not</br>   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you</br>   if you're an American citizen or not.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, &quot;I am</br>   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.&quot; She was put</br>   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in</br>   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm</br>   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody</br>   ever knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected</br>   your life. Can you talk about that too?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire</br>   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that</br>   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to</br>   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't</br>   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You</br>   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you</br>   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd</br>   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled</br>   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What</br>   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing</br>   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the</br>   shadows. Nobody really knows.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You used a metaphor --</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in</br>   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're</br>   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in</br>   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but</br>   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being</br>   in a golden cage.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did being undocumented affect your education?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented affected my education. The first time was when I</br>   wanted to apply to Whitney Young—when I wanted to go to a different high</br>   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for</br>   it, but they were asking … I don't remember what kind of document they were</br>   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, &quot;You know</br>   what? Let’s not. I don't want to. It's not worth it if I get deported. I</br>   don't need to be—it's not necessary.&quot; So I went to my local high school,</br>   which … not the best high school, Washington High School, but they had the</br>   IB program.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd you want to go to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my</br>   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my</br>   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm</br>   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't</br>   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated</br>   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in</br>   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, &quot;Ugh. What</br>   am I supposed to do with you?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is</br>   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I</br>   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.</br>   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.</br>   I think the problem with human beings is that you’re your only true enemy.</br>   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you</br>   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,</br>   sniffles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.</br>   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid</br>   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because</br>   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't</br>   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get</br>   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].</br>   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on</br>   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn</br>   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then</br>   [Chuckles] I sculpted something—a huge tiger—and I turned it in and it was</br>   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one</br>   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still</br>   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="ff7094f3-7994-44c1-8d7b-6c46ab311947" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Extracurricular activities">Luisa: I wanted to get into a good university. I was like, &quot;Okay, high<br>
   school's fine. Okay, whatever. We're going to make do. I'm going to be the<br>
   best student wherever I am.&quot; So I started swimming, track, volleyball,<br>
   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it<br>
   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a<br>
   bunch of community work—I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog<br>
   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,<br>
   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,<br>
   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.<br>

   Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't<br>
   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted<br>
   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my<br>
   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I<br>
   was like, &quot;Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this.&quot; I wanted to be an<br>
   oncologist—yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't<br>
   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want<br>
   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in<br>
   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.<br>

  </span> Luisa: My grandmother is an American citizen, and she's lived in the US on</br>   and off for about 50 years. My grandmother's Texan at heart and never</br>   learned English, but very, very Texan [Laughs]. My mother, she had to cross</br>   the bad way. She went through the desert, she went through the river. My</br>   sisters and I, we went through the bridge, like the regular crossing, but</br>   we used other people's papers. My middle sister, they cut her hair off</br>   completely, and I had to call her Jose.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She had short, short hair. My sister's hair was up to her waist, and</br>   my mom just shaved it off and her name was Jose now, and it was a game. I</br>   didn't know what was happening, of course. We arrived to ____ California.</br>   We arrived at an apartment that we were sharing with about eight other</br>   people—my grandparents, my sisters and I, my mother, my uncles, then</br>   eventually my uncle's wife. One of my uncles got the opportunity to move to</br>   Chicago—a job opportunity—so he moved. I think after my parents divorced,</br>   all of my uncles saw us as their kids, because two of the ones that really</br>   took care of us never really had kids, so they loved us and they brought us</br>   in.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: We moved to Chicago with my grandparents because my grandparents</br>   were my second parents by this point. My mother is the eldest—she took care</br>   of seven of my grandparents’ children, so my grandmother really, really</br>   loves my mother. We moved to Chicago to an apartment on Green Bay on the</br>   East Side, and that's how it went.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let me ask you a few questions going backwards. Was there any</br>   domestic abuse in your family?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: With my parents? My mother, yes. She doesn't like to talk about it.</br>   The older I get, the more she opens up, but it's not something that she</br>   likes to talk about. It was never in front of us, it was behind closed</br>   doors. I thank my father. He's a piece of shit, but I thank him for at</br>   least having the thought of not wanting to traumatize us. So yes, it was</br>   behind closed doors, but the more I get out of my mom, it was a lot of</br>   emotional abuse as well, a lot. I think there was some physical abuse. My</br>   mom's never touched upon it, but that's what happened. And then we got to</br>   Chicago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time we spoke, you talked about how difficult it was to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To leave my dad?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: ... to leave things behind.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Of course. I grew up fairly wealthy in Mexico. I had a big, big</br>   house. I had two German Shepherds that ran around everywhere. I had a</br>   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.</br>   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I</br>   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go</br>   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They</br>   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side. I</br>   would lay and sleep on my dad's chest always. Always, always, always,</br>   always, always, so it was extremely difficult to leave my dad behind the</br>   most. My dad was my world back then. But my dad, my friends, school—school</br>   was great, I loved school [Chuckles]—I had to leave it all behind.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I left, I was six years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The apartment you moved into—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: The apartment that we moved into in California was a one-bedroom</br>   apartment. It was a big complex and I remember it. There was a pool in the</br>   middle and there were a lot of families like us that shared a one-bedroom</br>   apartment. And there were eight to twelve people in this one space, and we</br>   were trying to find something bigger, but it was impossible.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember what your mood was like at that time?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Jarring. It was extremely jarring. From one day to another, the move</br>   was extremely … it was jarring. One day, you have a family and you're</br>   happy, and then the next, you can't even speak the language. You can't</br>   communicate, you don't know where you're at. I felt like my whole world was</br>   tilted to the side.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How soon after getting to California did you move to Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Within three to six months. It didn't take that long … immediately</br>   kind of. I think one of my uncles took it upon himself to take care of us,</br>   and since my mom … my mom at the time, we did not know she had a tumor in</br>   the back of her brain. Right where her brain stem is, she had a huge tumor</br>   there and we had no idea. Nobody knew. She doesn't remember a lot of this.</br>   I don't know if it's because of the emotional trauma or because of the</br>   tumor, but once we got to Chicago, it was evident that something was wrong</br>   with my mother and she started going to the doctor.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Thank God for Cook County Hospital [Chuckles]. They don't charge you</br>   a thing, but she got the medical treatment that she needed. She had brain</br>   surgery. They removed the tumor and she had to be in therapy for a few</br>   years in order to gain … she couldn't talk. She didn't have movement in</br>   half of her face, so she couldn't speak because her tongue was numb on one</br>   side, so she had to have physical therapy. I went with her a couple times</br>   because I had to translate. Sometimes they didn't have people who would</br>   translate for my mother. At this point, I had already learned English, but</br>   she had to practice every single day. Still to this day, there are a few</br>   words that she cannot say.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: She can't pronounce them or she doesn't remember them?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She can't pronounce them. She'll talk like this [imitates] because</br>   she can't move half of her face.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the tumor benign?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, it was benign. Thank God for that. But she had an encounter</br>   with TB and then she was on medication for that. You know what I think it</br>   was? I think that all this negativity affected her [Chuckles], or I don't</br>   know if you believe this, but the law of attraction. I think that she</br>   really did not want to keep going and that affected her quite a bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When did you start going to school, in Chicago or in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I moved to Chicago and that's where I started going to school. I</br>   started going to school at the age of six. Unfortunately, the school that I</br>   went to did not have a bilingual program. I was stuck with Miss S.</br>   [Chuckles]. I'm never going to forget her … Miss S., lovely woman</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that sarcastic?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, [Chuckles] very sarcastic. Did not speak a lick of Spanish. Not</br>   one sentence. I don't think she knew how to pronounce anything, and she was</br>   as WASP [White Anglo-Saxon Protestant] as you can get. This woman would get</br>   extremely frustrated with me—extremely—and I didn't know what was going on.</br>   To me, it was a completely … [Disgusted sound] it was mind-boggling how I</br>   could go from—I knew how to read and write in Spanish. I was a pretty smart</br>   kid. I knew how to read and write in Spanish at six years old. So I go into</br>   first grade and I can't even understand what my teachers are saying, so it</br>   was extremely frustrating and this teacher found it extremely frustrating</br>   as well, so she would lay me down face down half the day on the magic</br>   carpet where she would read stories to everyone because she didn't want to</br>   deal with it anymore. I told my mom—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because she didn't want to deal with what?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Deal with me anymore. I guess she didn't know where to put me. She</br>   didn't know what to do with me, she didn't know how to teach me, so her</br>   solution was to put me aside and not have to deal with me, so I had to</br>   pretty much be invisible for half the class. Just put my head down and not</br>   say a word. So I picked up English extremely fast because I had to</br>   [Chuckles]. I had to pick up English very, very, very fast or that was</br>   going to keep happening. I didn't want that to keep happening, so I picked</br>   it up.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I told my mom about this and I remember vividly having a</br>   conversation with her and telling her, &quot;Hey, you know what? This is</br>   happening at school,&quot; but I think my mom was going through so much stuff</br>   that she didn't know how to deal with it or she didn't … there wasn't</br>   enough of my mom to go around back then. I know now. I forgive her, but</br>   certain things … [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.</br>   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this</br>   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her</br>   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She</br>   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She</br>   started going to design school for designing clothes and it’s pretty great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in one second. If you were lying face down on</br>   the magic carpet all day, how did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was there for half the day, and this is something that I'm going</br>   to tell you that my teachers had told me in kindergarten. I could be</br>   sitting down underneath the table and playing around, and they would be</br>   teaching math and I could learn it. I'm an extremely fast learner—an</br>   extremely fast learner. I think I picked it up by just listening to it, and</br>   the few classes that I had, I picked it up. It was not that hard and I</br>   think at that age it's easier to absorb information, but I think it was</br>   mostly that I'm a quick learner.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did the kids tease you? Were they friendly to you? What was it like</br>   in Miss S. class?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to</br>   me, J___ and— what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good</br>   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of</br>   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher</br>   was not having it … She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of</br>   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some</br>   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They</br>   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a</br>   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is</br>   getting married soon, so yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you bullied?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied</br>   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at</br>   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word “shoot,” it was a</br>   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].</br>   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was</br>   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace</br>   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school</br>   that I had to go to was not a good school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Miss S. school was a better quality school?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. That says a lot about the education system [Chuckles]. One of</br>   my best friends is a teacher right now. It's awful. Then I picked up</br>   reading pretty fast. I think in fourth grade was the first largest book</br>   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the</br>   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald</br>   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,</br>   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,</br>   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as</br>   well childrens’ books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same</br>   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the</br>   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where</br>   you would go and read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: In eighth grade?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they</br>   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy</br>   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy</br>   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more</br>   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.</br>   During the summer reading programs—I'm not sure if you know, but in the</br>   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was always the top winner because … they knew me. I knew the</br>   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a</br>   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. “Oh, your</br>   book is here.” I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill</br>   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to</br>   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was</br>   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a</br>   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books—so many.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it</br>   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry</br>   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with</br>   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the</br>   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I</br>   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a</br>   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading</br>   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was there a space at home where you went to read?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] No, I didn't have a specific place. Any place that was quiet</br>   at the moment. I didn't have a specific place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the</br>   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original</br>   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's</br>   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into</br>   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a</br>   huge reader [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy—extremely fascinated by human</br>   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,</br>   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed</br>   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have</br>   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.</br>   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book … I don't know.</br>   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained</br>   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black</br>   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and</br>   when Mr. Niccolò Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,</br>   historical fiction. I was into everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge</br>   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, “are you above the</br>   law? Is anybody above the law?” Yes, I was big on reading. I loved reading</br>   [Chuckles]. Then absurdism. I'm big on reading [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You told me last time about your—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Eighth grade teacher.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R. is the best teacher I have had and he changed my life. Mr. R</br>   is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful human being. [Pause] I had a lot of</br>   teachers that would not … They would question me and they would ... All the</br>   stuff that I would write, they would question if I was okay mentally</br>   because of all this darkness [Chuckles] that I would write about, because a</br>   lot of my stories or a lot of my poetry was extremely dark. I don't think</br>   that's a bad thing you know. I think that's just trying to get rid of the …</br>   it's a catalyst. You're trying to get rid of everything that's inside of</br>   you, and that's how I did it.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Mr. R was the first one that recognized it as something good. We</br>   still keep in touch—beautiful human being. I knew this. He would speak to</br>   me like we were adults—like I was an adult. I was a thirteen-year-old girl</br>   and we had conversations like adults. I don't know how appropriate it was</br>   or what he saw in me, but we had conversations like adults. I would stay</br>   after class for hours just discussing books that he would give me, and he</br>   would give me books out of his collection for me to read.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about</br>   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He</br>   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.</br>   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccolò Machiavelli. I</br>   actually have “the end justifies the means” tattooed on me.</br> </br> </br>   It’s tattooed back here. Realism to me was … it's real. Human beings are</br>   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will</br>   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just</br>   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,</br>   if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: But yes, Mr. R was beautiful. He was a lawyer. He was a criminal</br>   lawyer. I'm not sure what kind of lawyer he was, but he hated defending</br>   people who were guilty. That man—oh my God I love that man—he hated it. He</br>   hated defending people who were guilty. There's this program called the</br>   “Golden Apple Program” where you can switch from being whatever it is that</br>   your career is to being a teacher, and it's what he did. Beautiful,</br>   beautiful man.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I</br>   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I</br>   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and</br>   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about</br>   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting. Yes, so Mr. R was</br>   someone beautiful and he taught me that [Pause] life is short and you need</br>   to seize the day. You need to take life by the balls [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting</br>   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because</br>   reading transports you to different places and different languages and</br>   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been</br>   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,</br>   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design</br>   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, &quot;You</br>   know what? I'm going to be independent,&quot; so she moves aside. She starts her</br>   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they</br>   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to</br>   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,</br>   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the</br>   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their</br>   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three</br>   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was</br>   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was</br>   great. I got to meet a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,</br>   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the</br>   attire?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would</br>   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was</br>   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with</br>   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It</br>   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],</br>   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took</br>   over.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he</br>   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to</br>   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would</br>   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, &quot;Oh, my God. What's</br>   happening?&quot; But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually</br>   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,</br>   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.</br>   They were great people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something you said yesterday that you said you didn't tell me about</br>   was something about adoption.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting</br>   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the</br>   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister—my other sister—were not</br>   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the</br>   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be</br>   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our</br>   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for</br>   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put</br>   a huge stop to that and was like, &quot;That's not happening. You're stupid.</br>   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: It was going to be a family member, not a close family member, but</br>   these were the lengths that you go through to try to get through this. I</br>   didn't have a normal childhood. I never got to learn to drive. I didn't go</br>   to drivers ed. I didn't get to travel with my best friend to DisneyLand</br>   because my mom was so scared of—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more</br>   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that</br>   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave</br>   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,</br>   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone</br>   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who</br>   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad</br>   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,</br>   &quot;Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”</br>   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I</br>   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The</br>   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on</br>   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with</br>   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this</br>   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my</br>   dad after three, four years?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You asked him to take you back?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't</br>   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, &quot;No,</br>   that's not happening with us.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking</br>   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my</br>   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them</br>   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate</br>   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think</br>   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon</br>   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his</br>   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back</br>   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're</br>   human beings.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or</br>   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me</br>   leave the room. She was like, &quot;I can't see you right now. Leave the room.</br>   You're so much like your dad. Leave.&quot; It really affected her. I get it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about being undocumented. When did you know? What was it</br>   like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just … I</br>   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my</br>   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things</br>   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family</br>   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.</br>   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good</br>   stories from him. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me—and I mean</br>   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every</br>   single day at her home or her grandparents’ home. If my mom couldn't find</br>   me, she'd call L___’s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my</br>   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, &quot;Hey. Could you</br>   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have</br>   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.&quot; All family events I</br>   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.</br>   We were best friends.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks</br>   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared</br>   like a deer in the headlights. “No, I'm not. I'm not.” I was so scared of</br>   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody—an ex-girlfriend, I think</br>   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we</br>   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we</br>   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So</br>   I was not allowed to tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of</br>   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed</br>   to tell this? This is a secret and—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.</br>   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty</br>   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I</br>   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science</br>   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not</br>   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you</br>   if you're an American citizen or not.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, &quot;I am</br>   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.&quot; She was put</br>   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in</br>   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm</br>   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody</br>   ever knew.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected</br>   your life. Can you talk about that too?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire</br>   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that</br>   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to</br>   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't</br>   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You</br>   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you</br>   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd</br>   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled</br>   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What</br>   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing</br>   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the</br>   shadows. Nobody really knows.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You used a metaphor --</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in</br>   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're</br>   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in</br>   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but</br>   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being</br>   in a golden cage.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did being undocumented affect your education?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Being undocumented affected my education. The first time was when I</br>   wanted to apply to Whitney Young—when I wanted to go to a different high</br>   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for</br>   it, but they were asking … I don't remember what kind of document they were</br>   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, &quot;You know</br>   what? Let’s not. I don't want to. It's not worth it if I get deported. I</br>   don't need to be—it's not necessary.&quot; So I went to my local high school,</br>   which … not the best high school, Washington High School, but they had the</br>   IB program.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd you want to go to—</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my</br>   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my</br>   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm</br>   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't</br>   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated</br>   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in</br>   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, &quot;Ugh. What</br>   am I supposed to do with you?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is</br>   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I</br>   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.</br>   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.</br>   I think the problem with human beings is that you’re your only true enemy.</br>   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you</br>   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,</br>   sniffles].</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.</br>   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid</br>   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because</br>   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't</br>   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get</br>   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].</br>   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on</br>   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn</br>   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then</br>   [Chuckles] I sculpted something—a huge tiger—and I turned it in and it was</br>   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one</br>   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still</br>   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted to get into a good university. I was like, &quot;Okay, high</br>   school's fine. Okay, whatever. We're going to make do. I'm going to be the</br>   best student wherever I am.&quot; So I started swimming, track, volleyball,</br>   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it</br>   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a</br>   bunch of community work—I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog</br>   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,</br>   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,</br>   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't</br>   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted</br>   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my</br>   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I</br>   was like, &quot;Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this.&quot; I wanted to be an</br>   oncologist—yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't</br>   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want</br>   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in</br>   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was set to go into a good future. That's what it was, but when it</br>   came down to it, my mom was like, &quot;No. You know what? You can't. You don't</br>   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to</br>   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your</br>   books. Each book, that's like $5000 for books. We can't do that. I'm</br>   sorry.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes, and that's when it had come out. Right when I had graduated</br>   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel</br>   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, &quot;You know what?</br>   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of</br>   us.&quot; But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or</br>   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government. That they're</br>   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where</br>   you live and who lives with you and where you are. I don't want that, and</br>   she did not allow that. I know. I know. I could've, but I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you fight?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: My mom? No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just accepted it?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: [Pause] Yes and no. It took me a while. I was even going to marry my</br>   best friend, E___. I was like, &quot;Let's get married. Let's get married.&quot; He</br>   was my best friend, but he didn't know why I wanted to get married</br>   [Laughs]. In my mind, I was like, &quot;Fuck it. Let's do this. I'll get papers</br>   and I'll continue my education. That's fine. Once we're married, he's stuck</br>   with me. I'll tell him then.” [Pause] I even thought about that. I was</br>   getting extremely desperate, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did E___ think? What did he think?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: When I told him I was moving to Mexico, he offered to marry me too</br>   so I would stay behind. I think he kind of knew at that point. I think E___</br>   knew. He wasn't a stupid guy. He called my mom mommy. He wasn't stupid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You returned to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I made the decision of returning, and I uprooted my sisters. My</br>   little sister was a year old when we left. She knew nothing about Mexico.</br>   She barely spoke Spanish, so I selfishly made everyone move back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Because I wanted to continue my education.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why didn't they stay behind?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I think my mom felt guilty. I think she didn't want me to be by</br>   myself. She felt guilty that she didn't allow me to apply for DACA, so</br>   she's like, &quot;Okay. That's okay.&quot; Eventually my sisters are going to have to</br>   go through this and let's do it now so the change doesn't hurt them as much</br>   when it comes down to it. They had it a little easier, I think [Chuckles].</br>   They didn't have to go through it twice, or maybe that's just my</br>   bitterness, but I had to go through that uprooting and going into a strange</br>   country twice [Chuckles]. They don't remember Mexico at all, so I don't</br>   think they remember any of the life that we had here.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I do. I remember my dogs. I remember my mom. I remember my dad. I</br>   remember my grandparents. I remember everything, and they didn't remember</br>   anything. Their entire life was over there, so that's just my bitterness.</br>   We moved back and I was so depressed. I don't think I've ever been that</br>   depressed in my life. I had to go back to high school because … even with</br>   the IB program. I killed myself. What was that worth, all that effort, and</br>   all that [Chokes up]? What was it worth? Nothing. I had to go back to this</br>   broken education system in Mexico which I could run laps around the fucking</br>   curriculum and I had to redo it in order to go to university, and fuck,</br>   that sucked.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I was extremely depressed. I didn't even want to leave the house</br>   because I didn't want to be reminded of the fact that I was not in the</br>   States anymore, because it was ugly. It was ugly where we lived.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was school like?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Hard at first. I was bullied at first. I remember … because my</br>   Spanish wasn't the best. When I got here, I had not practiced my Spanish in</br>   so long. I knew how to read and write, but my grammar was not the best</br>   either. I had kindergarten education. That's how long I [Chuckles] …</br>   everything else, a lot of my teachers were understanding. My literature</br>   teacher was extremely understanding. I thank him for that. He was the one</br>   that asked me to write and I wrote a short story about a sparrow getting</br>   lost in the snow and then turning up in the jungle, and the sparrow makes</br>   friends with all the cockatoos and the snake and the anaconda and they're</br>   all bros and he learns to speak their language—not very well, but he</br>   learns.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: The sparrow gets old and keeps living there and he's like, &quot;You know</br>   what? I love this place and I love my friends, and even though it kills me</br>   to leave all my friends behind here in the jungle, I need to go back to my</br>   home,&quot; [Chokes up] so the sparrow makes his journey and he dies. He makes</br>   it to the snow and he dies looking at the tree where he had his nest.</br>   [Crying] My literature teacher I think was pretty impacted by that. He was</br>   pretty understanding.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the snow Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. I miss the snow like crazy [Continues crying]. I remember the</br>   first Christmas we spent here was … It didn't feel like Christmas. It did</br>   not feel like Christmas. It felt weird. I wasn't used to it. [Pause] I gave</br>   that to the teacher. The teacher published it. My literature teacher was</br>   extremely well known in the community. He's world renowned, I think,</br>   because he is the host for the International Poets Meeting. He's the host,</br>   so I'm pretty sure he's well known in the literature world, and he</br>   published a lot of my poetry too because I had a lot of poetry—and in</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: He understood English and he would tear up with a lot of the stuff</br>   that I would give him. Very, very understanding, but we bonded over</br>   literature because he was extremely, extremely into books.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like Mr. R?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Like Mr. R, yes. R___, that's his name.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes. He was pretty great. He would talk about philosophy. He helped</br>   a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [So you studied international relations] Why international</br>   relations?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: International relations because I am a fucking citizen of the world.</br>   Every time somebody asks me, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; I have no idea how to</br>   answer because I don't feel Mexican and I don't feel American. I don't know</br>   what I am, so fuck it. I'm going to be a citizen of the world [Chuckles].</br>   I'm going to take all of this and I'm going to be international. That's it.</br>   That's it. We're going to be international. That's it, because genuinely,</br>   honest to God, I don't know how to answer when somebody asks me.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm not sure if you've seen when they've asked me, &quot;Where are you</br>   from?&quot; and I'm like, &quot;Where was I born? Where was I raised? Where's my</br>   family from? Where do I live? What do you want to know?” Because “where are</br>   you from?” is a very loaded question to me. It's a lot about identity, and</br>   I think a human being needs this [Pause] identity, this sense of belonging,</br>   and I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't feel like I have a home.</br>   Like a real one. At this point, I think my home is my partner and that</br>   scares the shit out of me [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I've thought about it. I've thought about it a lot [Chuckles]. It</br>   scares me because he has become my home. He's helped me through a lot. He's</br>   helped me get through a lot of traumas. He's helped me stand up to my</br>   father because I was not able to have a conversation with him. I was not</br>   able to say no to my dad [Sniffles]. I always wanted to please my dad</br>   because I never had him in my life, so I wanted him to be happy with me</br>   now. He's helped me a lot, so scary shit [Chuckles]. I don't like thinking</br>   about it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only two more questions that are more reflective.</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: Yes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: One is this idea about what did the US lose by losing someone like</br>   you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I'm pretty sure if I wasn't going to be an oncologist, maybe a</br>   neuroscientist or a neurosurgeon. People like me, I'<span id="e78565c2-5b9f-4d50-a105-eac8d5c3e9c1" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Working hard, getting good grades">m driven, man. I'm<br>
   extremely driven. When you grow up with all of these people telling you<br>
   that you can't, you want it more and you want it more and you have this<br>
   hunger inside of you that you want it and you need it and you're going to<br>
   make it, and I'm pretty sure I could run laps around all these fuckers that<br>
   were born citizens.</span> So they did—they lost somebody who can better society.</br>   I'm pretty sure I had a lot to offer … in a lot of senses.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What has Mexico gained by gaining you?</br> </br> </br>   Luisa: I think they've gained a lot. I think Mexico has gained a lot, but</br>   they don't know how to appreciate it. They pretty much throw us aside.</br>   Unfortunately, the Mexican government does not think that people who are</br>   returning from the States have anything to offer, and they're dead wrong</br>   about that. Honestly, if you look at a lot of these people that are coming</br>   back, they have so much to offer. They have so much to give and they have</br>   so much drive and they're hungry, but they don't make it easy for us.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="5f516620-9438-4ae6-a2a5-b7cb9ad23446" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico">Luisa: I had to go through hell in order to get my paperwork done for<br>
   school—through hell, and then I still had to do two years. If that was<br>
   somebody else with a little bit less drive or a little bit less enthusiasm,<br>
   they would've given up and they wouldn't have continued with their studies.<br>
   They would've said, &quot;Fuck it. Why? They're putting me against the wall. How<br>
