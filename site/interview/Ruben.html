   the states? How old were you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: 5 or 4. We migrated because of the money situation that we had. We<br>
   had what I remember as a pretty low income. My dad couldn't keep a stable<br>
   job. He would actually work in the mornings and in the afternoons he would<br>
   be fixing neighbors cars, their toilet, their shower head, their sinks,<br>
   paint houses, but it wasn't enough. So we didn't actually come together.<br>
   They came to the United States, were there for nine months, saved up some<br>
   money, and then they came back and got me and my sister. They went over<br>
   there, worked, saved money, and then they came back for us and that's when<br>
   we landed on 59th and Vermont.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Who were you living with when they were away?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My grandparents.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In Mexico city?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mm-hmm (affirmative) They were taking care of us. Me and my sister.</br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to leave them?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that</br>   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your</br>   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at</br>   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: But I mean they treat us good. It was just little things that you</br>   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was</br>   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two</br>   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually</br>   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the</br>   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and</br>   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of</br>   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,</br>   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards</br>   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and</br>   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,</br>   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both</br>   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,</br>   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or</br>   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards</br>   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I</br>   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,</br>   they didn't love me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with</br>   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those</br>   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told</br>   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger</br>   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,</br>   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an</br>   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you</br>   are already ready for that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the third thing?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you</br>   to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do they do it?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real</br>   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but</br>   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would</br>   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,</br>   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a</br>   group of gang members.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why do they kick them out?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn</br>   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They</br>   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too</br>   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I</br>   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Piece of broom?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.</br>   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and</br>   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends</br>   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit</br>   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so</br>   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would</br>   you say?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a</br>   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were</br>   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good</br>   students, and we had good grades-</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and</br>   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.</br>   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go</br>   to Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,</br>   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp;amp; Girls</br>   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was</br>   like, &quot;So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those</br>   guys.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's</br>   how everything starts involving it, &quot;Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to</br>   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably</br>   might have been different?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I</br>   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from</br>   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like three times and</br>   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they</br>   put me on probation for a year. My probation officer was actually the</br>   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.</br>   The greatest one was going to see the Lakers. he took me there. He was the</br>   first one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I</br>   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, so what did I</br>   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.</br>   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed</br>   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I</br>   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.</br>   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of</br>   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his</br>   house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: By?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.</br>   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me</br>   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool</br>   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,</br>   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front</br>   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.</br>   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are</br>   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.</br>   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA</br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,</br>   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but</br>   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of</br>   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same</br>   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of</br>   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new</br>   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.</br>   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,</br>   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment</br>   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come</br>   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to</br>   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my</br>   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like</br>   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside</br>   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put</br>   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of</br>   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by</br>   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when</br>   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just</br>   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me</br>   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,</br>   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will</br>   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.</br>   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.</br>   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,</br>   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does</br>   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on</br>   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your</br>   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not</br>   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how</br>   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are</br>   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side</br>   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to</br>   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay</br>   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the</br>   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;</br>   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que</br>   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them</br>   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they</br>   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,</br>   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like</br>   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,</br>   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I</br>   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean</br>   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll</br>   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Gangster.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That’s the meaning?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the</br>   little walk, you're a cholo.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is it like your mark?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call</br>   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a</br>   month, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you</br>   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;Ruben.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me</br>   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around</br>   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My</br>   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole</br>   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you</br>   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,</br>   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash</br>   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like</br>   &quot;Ruben will clean''.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that</br>   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it</br>   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that</br>   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid</br>   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing</br>   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that</br>   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually</br>   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get</br>   flooded.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You gave a service, then.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="28544a73-4da2-4847-9a49-bc7cd7db4616" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs, Occupation">Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy<br>
   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what<br>
   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys<br>
   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it<br>
   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me<br>
   back in that block. It's too far.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot<br>
   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from LA&quot;, and it's good to be<br>
   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.<br>
   Things change.<br>

   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front<br>
   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.<br>
   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are<br>

 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.</br>   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA</br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,</br>   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but</br>   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of</br>   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same</br>   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of</br>   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new</br>   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.</br>   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,</br>   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment</br>   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come</br>   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to</br>   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my</br>   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like</br>   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside</br>   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put</br>   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of</br>   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by</br>   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when</br>   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just</br>   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me</br>   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,</br>   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will</br>   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.</br>   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.</br>   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,</br>   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does</br>   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on</br>   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your</br>   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not</br>   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how</br>   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are</br>   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side</br>   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to</br>   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay</br>   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the</br>   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;</br>   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que</br>   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them</br>   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they</br>   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,</br>   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like</br>   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,</br>   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I</br>   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean</br>   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll</br>   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Gangster.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That’s the meaning?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the</br>   little walk, you're a cholo.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is it like your mark?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call</br>   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a</br>   month, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you</br>   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;Ruben.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me</br>   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around</br>   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My</br>   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole</br>   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you</br>   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,</br>   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash</br>   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like</br>   &quot;Ruben will clean''.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that</br>   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it</br>   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that</br>   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid</br>   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing</br>   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that</br>   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually</br>   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get</br>   flooded.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You gave a service, then.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy</br>   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what</br>   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys</br>   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it</br>   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me</br>   back in that block. It's too far.</br> </br> </br>   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot</br>   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from LA&quot;, and it's good to be</br>   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.</br>   Things change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span id="4f7b47c0-d56c-46f9-bf0c-272acc064be8" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Time in the US, Pastimes"></span> got me and my sister. They went over</br>   there, worked, saved money, and then they came back for us and that's when</br>   we landed on 59th and Vermont.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who were you living with when they were away?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My grandparents.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In Mexico city?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mm-hmm (affirmative) They were taking care of us. Me and my sister.</br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to leave them?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that</br>   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your</br>   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at</br>   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: But I mean they treat us good. It was just little things that you</br>   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was</br>   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two</br>   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually</br>   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the</br>   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and</br>   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of</br>   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,</br>   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards</br>   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and</br>   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,</br>   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both</br>   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,</br>   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or</br>   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards</br>   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I</br>   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,</br>   they didn't love me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with</br>   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those</br>   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told</br>   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger</br>   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,</br>   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an</br>   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you</br>   are already ready for that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the third thing?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you</br>   to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do they do it?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real</br>   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but</br>   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would</br>   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,</br>   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a</br>   group of gang members.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why do they kick them out?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn</br>   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They</br>   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too</br>   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I</br>   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Piece of broom?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.</br>   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and</br>   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends</br>   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit</br>   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so</br>   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would</br>   you say?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="e843375a-ad3b-464d-9f8d-851a61998a9f" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Time in the US, Pastimes, Sports, Playing">Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a<br>
   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were<br>
   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good<br>
   students, and we had good grades-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and<br>

   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to<br>
   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just<br>
   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was<br>
   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to<br>
   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get<br>
   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually<br>
   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.<br>
   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You<br>
   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless<br>

   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It<br>
   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at<br>
   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African<br>
   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,<br>
   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day<br>
   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It<br>
   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it<br>
   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought<br>
   they were going to hit us.<br>

   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was<br>
   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't<br>
   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with<br>
   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.<br>
   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the<br>
   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my<br>
   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two</br>   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually</br>   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the</br>   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and</br>   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of</br>   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,</br>   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards</br>   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and</br>   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,</br>   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both</br>   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,</br>   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or</br>   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards</br>   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I</br>   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,</br>   they didn't love me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with</br>   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those</br>   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told</br>   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger</br>   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,</br>   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an</br>   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you</br>   are already ready for that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the third thing?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you</br>   to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do they do it?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real</br>   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but</br>   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would</br>   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,</br>   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a</br>   group of gang members.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why do they kick them out?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn</br>   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They</br>   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too</br>   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I</br>   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Piece of broom?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.</br>   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and</br>   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends</br>   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit</br>   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so</br>   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would</br>   you say?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a</br>   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were</br>   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good</br>   students, and we had good grades-</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and</br>   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.</br>   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go</br>   to Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,</br>   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp;amp; Girls</br>   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was</br>   like, &quot;So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those</br>   guys.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's</br>   how everything starts involving it, &quot;Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to</br>   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably</br>   might have been different?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I</br>   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from</br>   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like three times and</br>   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they</br>   put me on probation for a year. My probation officer was actually the</br>   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.</br>   The greatest one was going to see the Lakers. he took me there. He was the</br>   first one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I</br>   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, so what did I</br>   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.</br>   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed</br>   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I</br>   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.</br>   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of</br>   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his</br>   house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: By?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.</br>   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me</br>   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool</br>   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,</br>   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front</br>   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.</br>   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are</br>   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.</br>   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA</br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,</br>   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but</br>   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of</br>   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same</br>   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of</br>   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new</br>   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.</br>   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,</br>   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment</br>   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come</br>   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to</br>   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my</br>   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like</br>   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside</br>   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put</br>   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of</br>   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by</br>   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="e5b536ab-6a06-4dd1-bcb8-37ba9bdc298d" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences, Discrimination">Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when<br>
   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just<br>
   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me<br>
   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,<br>
   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will<br>
   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.<br>
   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.<br>
   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,<br>
   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does<br>
   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his<br>
   money.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on<br>
   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your<br>
   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not<br>
   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how<br>
   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are<br>
   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side<br>
   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to<br>
   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay<br>
   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the<br>
   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;<br>
   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que<br>
   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them</br>   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they</br>   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,</br>   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like</br>   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,</br>   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I</br>   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean</br>   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll</br>   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Gangster.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That’s the meaning?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the</br>   little walk, you're a cholo.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is it like your mark?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call</br>   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a</br>   month, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you</br>   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;Ruben.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me</br>   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around</br>   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My</br>   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole</br>   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you</br>   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,</br>   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash</br>   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like</br>   &quot;Ruben will clean''.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that</br>   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it</br>   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that</br>   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid</br>   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing</br>   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that</br>   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually</br>   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get</br>   flooded.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You gave a service, then.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy</br>   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what</br>   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys</br>   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it</br>   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me</br>   back in that block. It's too far.</br> </br> </br>   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot</br>   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from LA&quot;, and it's good to be</br>   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.</br>   Things change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span id="147d2739-5cd4-454e-81bd-fe9114a02ea4" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Police: US, Racial profiling, Mistreatment by"></span>la, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two</br>   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually</br>   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the</br>   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and</br>   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of</br>   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,</br>   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards</br>   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and</br>   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,</br>   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both</br>   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,</br>   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or</br>   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards</br>   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I</br>   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,</br>   they didn't love me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with</br>   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those</br>   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told</br>   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger</br>   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,</br>   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an</br>   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you</br>   are already ready for that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the third thing?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you</br>   to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do they do it?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real</br>   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but</br>   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would</br>   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,</br>   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a</br>   group of gang members.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why do they kick them out?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn</br>   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They</br>   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too</br>   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I</br>   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Piece of broom?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.</br>   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and</br>   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends</br>   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit</br>   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so</br>   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would</br>   you say?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a</br>   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were</br>   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good</br>   students, and we had good grades-</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and</br>   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.</br>   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go</br>   to Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,</br>   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp;amp; Girls</br>   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was</br>   like, &quot;So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those</br>   guys.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's</br>   how everything starts involving it, &quot;Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to</br>   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably</br>   might have been different?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I</br>   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from</br>   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like three times and</br>   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they</br>   put me on probation for a year. My probation officer was actually the</br>   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.</br>   The greatest one was going to see the Lakers. he took me there. He was the</br>   first one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I</br>   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, so what did I</br>   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.</br>   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed</br>   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I</br>   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.</br>   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of</br>   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his</br>   house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: By?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.</br>   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me</br>   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool</br>   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,</br>   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front</br>   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.</br>   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are</br>   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.</br>   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA</br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,</br>   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but</br>   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of</br>   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="2b38ca5f-fe3e-4f0c-b943-4a95b856ef20" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same<br>
   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of<br>
   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new<br>
   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.<br>
   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,<br>
   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment<br>
   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come<br>
   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to<br>
   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my<br>
   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like<br>
   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside<br>
   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put<br>
   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of<br>
   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by<br>
   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when</br>   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just</br>   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me</br>   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,</br>   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will</br>   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.</br>   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.</br>   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,</br>   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does</br>   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on</br>   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your</br>   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not</br>   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how</br>   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are</br>   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side</br>   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to</br>   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay</br>   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the</br>   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;</br>   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que</br>   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="e5b120a6-6e0a-485a-ab3c-79e38381fa57" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them<br>
   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they<br>
   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,<br>
   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like<br>
   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,<br>
   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I<br>
   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean<br>

   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.<br>
   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed<br>
   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I<br>
   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.<br>
   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of<br>

I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same</br>   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of</br>   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new</br>   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.</br>   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,</br>   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment</br>   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come</br>   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to</br>   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my</br>   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like</br>   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside</br>   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put</br>   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of</br>   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by</br>   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when</br>   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just</br>   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me</br>   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,</br>   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will</br>   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.</br>   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.</br>   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,</br>   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does</br>   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on</br>   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your</br>   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not</br>   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how</br>   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are</br>   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side</br>   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to</br>   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay</br>   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the</br>   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;</br>   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que</br>   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them</br>   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they</br>   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,</br>   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like</br>   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,</br>   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I</br>   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean</br>   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll</br>   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Gangster.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That’s the meaning?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the</br>   little walk, you're a cholo.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is it like your mark?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call</br>   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a</br>   month, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you</br>   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;Ruben.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me</br>   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around</br>   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My</br>   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole</br>   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you</br>   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,</br>   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash</br>   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like</br>   &quot;Ruben will clean''.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that</br>   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it</br>   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that</br>   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid</br>   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing</br>   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that</br>   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually</br>   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get</br>   flooded.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You gave a service, then.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy</br>   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what</br>   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys</br>   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it</br>   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me</br>   back in that block. It's too far.</br> </br> </br>   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot</br>   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from LA&quot;, and it's good to be</br>   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.</br>   Things change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span id="d7fdea4b-2a9d-4286-92cd-c2d5292c2854" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out,  skipping class, Police, Treatment by, Mentors"></span>nded on 59th and Vermont.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who were you living with when they were away?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My grandparents.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In Mexico city?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mm-hmm (affirmative) They were taking care of us. Me and my sister.</br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to leave them?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that</br>   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your</br>   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at</br>   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: But I mean they treat us good. It was just little things that you</br>   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was</br>   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two</br>   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually</br>   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="3db461a6-d8ce-4fbd-9a58-8e59634a3248" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Gangs, Affiliation, Camaraderie/family, Family, Fitting in, Gangs, Fights, Homelife, Family, Fights, Arguments/Estrangement, Teenage rebellion">Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the<br>
   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and<br>
   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of<br>
   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,<br>
   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards<br>
   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and<br>
   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,<br>
   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both<br>
   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,<br>
   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or<br>
   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards<br>
   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I<br>
   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,<br>
   they didn't love me.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with<br>
   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those<br>
   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told<br>
   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger<br>
   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,<br>
   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an<br>
   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you<br>
   are already ready for that.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with<br>
   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My<br>
   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they<br>
   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit<br>
   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was<br>
   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get<br>
   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community<br>
   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it<br>
   will be only with certain people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I<br>
   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to<br>

   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there<br>
   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.<br>
   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could<br>
   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I<br>
   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,<br>
   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in<br>
   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because<br>
   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,<br>
   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or<br>
   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,<br>
   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your<br>
   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;<br>

   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.<br>
   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,<br>
   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so<br>
   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like<br>
   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take<br>
   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,<br>
   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got<br>
   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started<br>
   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like<br>
   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would<br>
   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for<br>
   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little<br>
   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then<br>
   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is<br>
   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: A corral?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't<br>
   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a<br>
   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the<br>
   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little<br>
   ranch.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and<br>
   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we<br>
   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of<br>
   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they<br>
   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the<br>
   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually<br>
   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were<br>
   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to<br>
   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making<br>
   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.<br>
   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they<br>
   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.<br>

   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right<br>
   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,<br>
   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.<br>
   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good<br>
   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our<br>
   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to<br>
   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't<br>
   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my<br>
   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want<br>
   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to<br>
   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and<br>
   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he<br>
   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell<br>
   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two<br>
   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught<br>
   me how to cut the corn.<br>

   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't<br>
   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he<br>
   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He<br>
   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you<br>
   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so<br>
   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We<br>
   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come<br>
   and you know, hear him speak.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But he was a politician?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take<br>
   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be<br>
   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,<br>

   Yeah.<br>

 <br>
   Anita: Was it hard to leave them?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that<br>
   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your<br>
   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at<br>
   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: But I mean they treat us good.</span> It was just little things that you<br>
   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was<br>
   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't<br>
   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with<br>
   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.<br>
   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the<br>
   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my<br>
   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So they left after your sister died?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.<br>

   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so<br>
   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like<br>
   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take<br>
   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,<br>
   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got<br>
   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started<br>
   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like<br>
   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would<br>
   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where<br>
   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there<br>
   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.<br>
   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could<br>
   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I<br>
   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,<br>
   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in<br>
   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because<br>
   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,<br>
   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or<br>
   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,<br>
   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your<br>
   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old<br>
   were you and what it was like<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it<br>
   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,<br>
   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It<br>
   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at<br>
   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African<br>
   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,<br>
   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day<br>
   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It<br>
   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it<br>
   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought<br>
   they were going to hit us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: The rioters?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,<br>
   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to<br>
   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just<br>
   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was<br>
   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to<br>
   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get<br>
   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually<br>
   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.<br>
   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You<br>
   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless<br>
   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it<br>
   looked like a big ball of fire.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real<br>
   cheap.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just<br>
   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine<br>
   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with<br>
   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My<br>
   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they<br>
   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit<br>
   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was<br>
   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get<br>
   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community<br>
   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it<br>
   will be only with certain people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I<br>
   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to<br>
   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,<br>
   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But<br>
   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but<br>
   took us like around nine months.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was<br>
   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was<br>
   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all<br>
   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to<br>
   them. We just try to go day by day.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize<br>
   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my<br>
   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,<br>
   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually<br>
   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I<br>
   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in<br>
   gangs?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well<br>
   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick<br>
   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking<br>
   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your<br>
   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;<br>
   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are<br>
   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards<br>
   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me<br>
   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I<br>
   do?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type<br>
   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with<br>
   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,<br>
   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I<br>
   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the<br>
   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he<br>
   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But<br>
   at the same time, I wasn't legal.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How old were you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing<br>
   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole<br>
   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,<br>
   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are<br>
   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I<br>
   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some<br>
   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,<br>
   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police<br>
   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's<br>
   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our<br>
   shoes.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come<br>
   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will<br>
   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're<br>
   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up<br>
   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I<br>
   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was<br>
   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little<br>
   more.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the<br>
   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and<br>
   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of<br>
   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,<br>
   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards<br>
   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and<br>
   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,<br>
   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both<br>
   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,<br>
   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or<br>
   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards<br>
   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I<br>
   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,<br>
   they didn't love me.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with<br>
   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those<br>
   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told<br>
   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger<br>
   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,<br>
   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an<br>
   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you<br>
   are already ready for that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Is that the third thing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you<br>
   to do that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How do they do it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real<br>
   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but<br>
   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would<br>
   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,<br>
   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a<br>
   group of gang members.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why do they kick them out?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn<br>
   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They<br>
   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too<br>
   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I<br>
   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Piece of broom?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.<br>
   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and<br>
   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends<br>
   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit<br>
   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so<br>
   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would<br>
   you say?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a<br>
   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were<br>
   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good<br>
   students, and we had good grades-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and<br>
   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.<br>
   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go<br>
   to Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,<br>
   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp;amp; Girls<br>
   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was<br>
   like, &quot;So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those<br>
   guys.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's<br>
   how everything starts involving it, &quot;Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to<br>
   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably<br>
   might have been different?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I<br>
   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from<br>
   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like three times and<br>
   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they<br>
   put me on probation for a year. My probation officer was actually the<br>
   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.<br>
   The greatest one was going to see the Lakers. he took me there. He was the<br>
   first one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I<br>
   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, so what did I<br>
   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.<br>
 <br>
 &lt;br/&gt;<br>
 <br>
   Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up<br>
   together.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.<br>
   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed<br>
   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I<br>
   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.<br>
   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of<br>
   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his<br>
   house.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: By?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.<br>
   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me<br>
   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool<br>
   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,<br>
   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front<br>
   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.<br>
   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are<br>
   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How old were you when this happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Just a kid?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he<br>
   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He<br>
   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she<br>
   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see<br>
   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.<br>
   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the<br>
   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to<br>
   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA<br>
   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep<br>
   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about<br>
   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my<br>
   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little<br>
   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have<br>
   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,<br>
   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a<br>
   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring<br>
   them there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have<br>
   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our<br>
   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,<br>
   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but<br>
   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park<br>
   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of<br>
   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that<br>
   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never<br>
   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never<br>
   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the<br>
   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another<br>
   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,<br>
   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had<br>
   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at<br>
   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that<br>
   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we<br>
   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and<br>
   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not<br>
   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's<br>
   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got<br>
   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to<br>
   handle.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that<br>
   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of<br>
   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't<br>
   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing<br>
   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area<br>
   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to<br>
   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying<br>
   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.<br>
   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom<br>
   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank<br>
   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same<br>
   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of<br>
   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new<br>
   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.<br>
   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,<br>
   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment<br>
   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come<br>
   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to<br>
   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my<br>
   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like<br>
   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside<br>
   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put<br>
   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of<br>
   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by<br>
   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people<br>
   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They<br>
   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be<br>
   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or<br>
   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I<br>
   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.<br>
   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because<br>
   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,<br>
   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if<br>
   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit<br>
   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,<br>
   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;<br>
   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I<br>
   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at<br>
   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can<br>
   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the<br>
   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not<br>
   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you<br>
   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are<br>
   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways<br>
   to help me out.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do<br>
   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get<br>
   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,<br>
   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be<br>
   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.<br>
   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the<br>
   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,<br>
   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the<br>
   environment right now with the same people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when<br>
   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just<br>
   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me<br>
   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,<br>
   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will<br>
   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.<br>
   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.<br>
   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,<br>
   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does<br>
   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his<br>
   money.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on<br>
   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your<br>
   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not<br>
   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how<br>
   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are<br>
   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side<br>
   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to<br>
   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay<br>
   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the<br>
   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;<br>
   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que<br>
   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who<br>
   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to<br>
   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks<br>
   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I<br>
   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and<br>
   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you<br>
   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?<br>
   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and<br>
   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell<br>
   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,<br>
   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I<br>
   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they<br>
   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's<br>
   them. People are different.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And<br>
   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really<br>
   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,<br>
   past.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have<br>
   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,<br>
   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right<br>
   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve<br>
   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it<br>
   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to<br>
   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is<br>
   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did<br>
   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;<br>
   There's people that don't think. They just act.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five<br>
   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government<br>
   people that used to come, they liked me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So you had left the gangs.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they<br>
   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still<br>
   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's<br>
   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I<br>
   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or<br>
   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually<br>
   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot<br>
   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them<br>
   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they<br>
   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,<br>
   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like<br>
   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,<br>
   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I<br>
   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean<br>
   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll<br>
   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Gangster.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: That’s the meaning?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the<br>
   little walk, you're a cholo.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Is it like your mark?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call<br>
   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a<br>
   month, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you<br>
   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;Ruben.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me<br>
   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around<br>
   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My<br>
   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole<br>
   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you<br>
   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,<br>
   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash<br>
   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like<br>
   &quot;Ruben will clean''.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that<br>
   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it<br>
   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that<br>
   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid<br>
   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing<br>
   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that<br>
   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually<br>
   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get<br>
   flooded.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You gave a service, then.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy<br>
   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what<br>
   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys<br>
   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it<br>
   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me<br>
   back in that block. It's too far.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot<br>
   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from LA&quot;, and it's good to be<br>
   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.<br>
   Things change.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Thank you so much.<br>
