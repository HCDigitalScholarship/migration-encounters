Why did you go to</br>   the states? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">5</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">4</span>. We migrated because of the money situation that we had. We</br>   had what I remember as a pretty low income. My dad couldn't keep a stable</br>   job. He would actually work in the mornings and in the afternoons he would</br>   be fixing neighbors cars, their toilet, their shower head, their sinks,</br>   paint houses, but it wasn't enough. So we didn't actually come together.</br>   They came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, were there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nine months</span>, saved up some</br>   money, and then they came back and got me and my sister. They went over</br>   there, worked, saved money, and then they came back for us and that's when</br>   we landed on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">59th</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Vermont</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Who were you living with when they were away?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: My grandparents.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: In Mexico city?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative) They were taking care of us. Me and my sister.</br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Was it hard to leave them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that</br>   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your</br>   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">4:30 in the morning</span> so you can shower.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: But I mean they treat us good. It was just little things that you</br>   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Gabriela</span>, she was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about nine months</span>, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah. She would've been right now, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">35</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span> : Probably <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like four years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Four years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: My other sister right now is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">31</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So your sister, is she still in the states, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the 31year old</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. So I had like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two days</span> to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span> he said you should have two chickens. It was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">two   o'clock in</span> the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">about 600</span> sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">4:30 in the morning</span> I did not like. But I had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two days</span> to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: We took a bus all the way to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">TJ</span> (<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Tijuana</span>), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Tijuana</span>. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: We hiked for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">at least five hours</span>. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">five in the morning</span> or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like a day</span>. After that they actually</br>   transported us to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Anaheim</span>. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Anaheim</span>, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span>.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">750</span> a person. It was like $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">400</span> for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">86</span>. And that's where we landed in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span>, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodney King</span> riot. It was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a few years</span>. Well I think like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six   years</span> before that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you remember <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">your first day</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span> near <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Bell Gardens</span>. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years later</span> we moved to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Whittier</span>, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about nine months</span> and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African American</span> people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Earlier you alluded to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="EVENT">the Rodney King</span> riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: When was this, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">'90</span>... I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">between what, 11 and 12</span>? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African</span></br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nine months</span>, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span>, from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">San Diego</span> so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African American</span> people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">a Payless Shoes</span> and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Payless Shoes</span>, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Maybe I would say well like $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">3</span>, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">between three and 10</span>. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a minute</span> and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years old</span>. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African American</span> people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a couple of days</span>. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">two in the morning</span> till <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">five</span> to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">12 at night</span>. Because he had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">around nine months</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How do you feel about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African Americans</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: I mean my best friend is actually <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African-America</span>. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rodney King</span> or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: There's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> one will be we're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latin</span>, we're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span>. When I got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Whittier</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Fuentes</span>. He was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">11</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span> when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14</span>, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club</span> or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You said there were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> is the cops. The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span>, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span> around <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">59th Street</span>, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14</span>, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> thing-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Well, I mean, look in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">83rd St.</span> from Vermont in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">59th</span> all the</br>   way to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">96th St.</span>, there was problems in between <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African American</span> kids and</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> kids. They didn't like us because we were not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. So all of</br>   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,</br>   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards</br>   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and</br>   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,</br>   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14</span>. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,</br>   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or</br>   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards</br>   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I</br>   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,</br>   they didn't love me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with</br>   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those</br>   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told</br>   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger</br>   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,</br>   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an</br>   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you</br>   are already ready for that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Is that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> thing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">Third</span>? Yeah, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> thing, it will be parents. Parents push you</br>   to do that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How do they do it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: There's parents, or well at least <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> parents, they're real</br>   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but</br>   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would</br>   kick them out when they were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span>. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,</br>   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a</br>   group of gang members.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why do they kick them out?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn</br>   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They</br>   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too</br>   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I</br>   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Piece of broom?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.</br>   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and</br>   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends</br>   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit</br>   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so</br>   that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> kids or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Central American</span> kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would</br>   you say?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a</br>   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were</br>   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good</br>   students, and we had good grades-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and</br>   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.</br>   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go</br>   to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club</span> right after school, stay there until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">7</span>, go home,</br>   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Boys &amp;amp; Girls   Clubs</span> ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was</br>   like, &quot;So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those</br>   guys.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's</br>   how everything starts involving it, &quot;Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to</br>   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably</br>   might have been different?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I</br>   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from</br>   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> times and</br>   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they</br>   put me on probation for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span>. My probation officer was actually the</br>   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.</br>   The greatest one was going to see the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Lakers</span>. he took me there. He was the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I</br>   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, so what did I</br>   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: It's a portrait of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of my elementary friends. We grew up</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.</br>   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed</br>   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I</br>   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.</br>   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of</br>   us, and he comes out <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month</span> after he actually gets killed in front of his</br>   house.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: By?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.</br>   It actually went insane for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a minute</span>. I thought everybody was against me</br>   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool</br>   friend. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Abraham</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Abraham Rodriguez</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Were you in jail at this time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,</br>   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front</br>   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.</br>   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are</br>   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15, 15 and a half</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: There was actually a group of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">15</span> kids. We all grew up together.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span> through <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">sixth</span> grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span></br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span>,</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span>, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">winter</span>, there's a park called, well there's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Whittier Narrows</span>, but</br>   there's another one where there's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">a Lake Santa Fe</span> down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">Santa Fe</span> down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Like down. And that was our thing to do <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every year</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Every 4th of   July</span> we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13 years</span>. It came off in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2004</span>, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span> of us out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">15</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Only five of you out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">15</span> survived?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah, actually, we're in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">night</span>, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same</br>   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of</br>   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new</br>   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.</br>   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,</br>   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment</br>   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come</br>   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to</br>   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my</br>   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like</br>   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside</br>   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put</br>   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of</br>   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by</br>   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">the 7-11</span>&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when</br>   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just</br>   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me</br>   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,</br>   you got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">5 pesos</span> I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will</br>   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.</br>   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.</br>   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,</br>   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does</br>   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on</br>   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your</br>   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not</br>   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how</br>   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are</br>   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side</br>   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to</br>   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay</br>   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the</br>   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;</br>   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que</br>   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a minute</span>. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">morning</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">Good afternoon</span>.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five   years</span>. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span> so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a minute</span>, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them</br>   knowledge that people here are different. People that are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">60</span> and up, they</br>   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,</br>   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like</br>   you. There's a lady right here who has been living <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">50 years</span>. She was like,</br>   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> cholo that I</br>   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean</br>   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll</br>   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Gangster.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That’s the meaning?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the</br>   little walk, you're a cholo.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Is it like your mark?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call</br>   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>. Finally, after like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a   month</span>, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you</br>   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around</br>   here. When I lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Estado de Mexico</span>, it was the same thing. My</br>   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole</br>   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you</br>   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,</br>   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash</br>   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like</br>   &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span> will clean''.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that</br>   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it</br>   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that</br>   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid</br>   him <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">180 pesos</span> and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing</br>   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that</br>   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually</br>   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get</br>   flooded.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You gave a service, then.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ruben</span>: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy</br>   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what</br>   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys</br>   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it</br>   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me</br>   back in that block. It's too far.</br> </br> </br>   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot</br>   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span>&quot;, and it's good to be</br>   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.</br>   Things change.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Mexican childhood, Family, Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Economic">Anita: I want to hear, first of all, why you migrated? Why did you go to   the states? How old were you?     Ruben: 5 or 4. We migrated because of the money situation that we had. We   had what I remember as a pretty low income. My dad couldn't keep a stable   job. He would actually work in the mornings and in the afternoons he would   be fixing neighbors cars, their toilet, their shower head, their sinks,   paint houses, but it wasn't enough. So we didn't actually come together.   They came to the United States, were there for nine months, saved up some   money, and then they came back and got me and my sister. They went over   there, worked, saved money, and then they came back for us and that's when   we landed on 59th and Vermont.    </span> Anita: Who were you living with when they were away?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My grandparents.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In Mexico city?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mm-hmm (affirmative) They were taking care of us. Me and my sister.</br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to leave them?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that</br>   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your</br>   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at</br>   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: But I mean they treat us good. It was just little things that you</br>   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was</br>   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two</br>   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually</br>   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the</br>   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and</br>   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of</br>   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,</br>   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards</br>   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and</br>   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,</br>   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both</br>   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,</br>   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or</br>   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards</br>   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I</br>   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,</br>   they didn't love me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with</br>   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those</br>   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told</br>   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger</br>   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,</br>   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an</br>   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you</br>   are already ready for that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the third thing?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you</br>   to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do they do it?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real</br>   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but</br>   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would</br>   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,</br>   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a</br>   group of gang members.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why do they kick them out?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn</br>   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They</br>   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too</br>   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I</br>   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Piece of broom?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.</br>   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and</br>   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends</br>   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit</br>   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so</br>   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would</br>   you say?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a</br>   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were</br>   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good</br>   students, and we had good grades-</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and</br>   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.</br>   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go</br>   to Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,</br>   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp;amp; Girls</br>   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was</br>   like, &quot;So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those</br>   guys.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's</br>   how everything starts involving it, &quot;Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to</br>   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably</br>   might have been different?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I</br>   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from</br>   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like three times and</br>   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they</br>   put me on probation for a year. My probation officer was actually the</br>   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.</br>   The greatest one was going to see the Lakers. he took me there. He was the</br>   first one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I</br>   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, so what did I</br>   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.</br>   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed</br>   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I</br>   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.</br>   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of</br>   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his</br>   house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: By?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.</br>   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me</br>   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool</br>   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,</br>   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front</br>   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.</br>   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are</br>   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.</br>   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA</br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,</br>   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but</br>   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of</br>   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same</br>   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of</br>   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new</br>   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.</br>   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,</br>   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment</br>   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come</br>   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to</br>   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my</br>   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like</br>   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside</br>   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put</br>   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of</br>   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by</br>   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences, Discrimination">Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his   money.     Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?    </span> Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them</br>   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they</br>   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,</br>   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like</br>   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,</br>   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I</br>   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean</br>   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll</br>   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Gangster.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That’s the meaning?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the</br>   little walk, you're a cholo.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is it like your mark?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call</br>   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a</br>   month, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you</br>   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;Ruben.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me</br>   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around</br>   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My</br>   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole</br>   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you</br>   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,</br>   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash</br>   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like</br>   &quot;Ruben will clean''.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that</br>   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it</br>   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that</br>   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid</br>   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing</br>   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that</br>   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually</br>   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get</br>   flooded.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You gave a service, then.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy</br>   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what</br>   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys</br>   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it</br>   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me</br>   back in that block. It's too far.</br> </br> </br>   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot</br>   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from LA&quot;, and it's good to be</br>   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.</br>   Things change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Police: US, Racial profiling, Mistreatment by"></span>la, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two</br>   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually</br>   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the</br>   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and</br>   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of</br>   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,</br>   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards</br>   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and</br>   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,</br>   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both</br>   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,</br>   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or</br>   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards</br>   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I</br>   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,</br>   they didn't love me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with</br>   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those</br>   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told</br>   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger</br>   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,</br>   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an</br>   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you</br>   are already ready for that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the third thing?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you</br>   to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do they do it?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real</br>   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but</br>   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would</br>   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,</br>   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a</br>   group of gang members.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why do they kick them out?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn</br>   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They</br>   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too</br>   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I</br>   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Piece of broom?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.</br>   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and</br>   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends</br>   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit</br>   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so</br>   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would</br>   you say?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a</br>   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were</br>   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good</br>   students, and we had good grades-</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and</br>   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.</br>   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go</br>   to Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,</br>   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp;amp; Girls</br>   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was</br>   like, &quot;So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those</br>   guys.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's</br>   how everything starts involving it, &quot;Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to</br>   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably</br>   might have been different?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I</br>   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from</br>   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like three times and</br>   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they</br>   put me on probation for a year. My probation officer was actually the</br>   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.</br>   The greatest one was going to see the Lakers. he took me there. He was the</br>   first one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I</br>   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, so what did I</br>   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.</br>   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed</br>   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I</br>   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.</br>   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of</br>   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his</br>   house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: By?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.</br>   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me</br>   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool</br>   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,</br>   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front</br>   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.</br>   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are</br>   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.</br>   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA</br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,</br>   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but</br>   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of</br>   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.     Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.    </span> Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when</br>   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just</br>   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me</br>   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,</br>   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will</br>   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.</br>   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.</br>   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,</br>   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does</br>   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on</br>   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your</br>   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not</br>   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how</br>   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are</br>   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side</br>   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to</br>   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay</br>   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the</br>   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;</br>   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que</br>   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Continuing education, Employment, Crime and Violence">Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that   I want to do.

When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.</br>   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are</br>   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.</br>   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA</br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,</br>   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but</br>   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of</br>   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same</br>   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of</br>   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new</br>   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.</br>   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,</br>   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment</br>   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come</br>   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to</br>   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my</br>   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like</br>   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside</br>   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put</br>   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of</br>   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by</br>   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when</br>   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just</br>   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me</br>   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,</br>   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will</br>   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.</br>   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.</br>   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,</br>   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does</br>   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on</br>   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your</br>   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not</br>   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how</br>   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are</br>   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side</br>   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to</br>   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay</br>   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the</br>   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;</br>   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que</br>   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them</br>   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they</br>   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,</br>   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like</br>   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,</br>   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I</br>   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean</br>   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll</br>   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Gangster.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That’s the meaning?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the</br>   little walk, you're a cholo.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is it like your mark?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call</br>   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a</br>   month, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you</br>   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;Ruben.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me</br>   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around</br>   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My</br>   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole</br>   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you</br>   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,</br>   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash</br>   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like</br>   &quot;Ruben will clean''.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that</br>   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it</br>   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that</br>   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid</br>   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing</br>   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that</br>   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually</br>   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get</br>   flooded.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You gave a service, then.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy</br>   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what</br>   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys</br>   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it</br>   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me</br>   back in that block. It's too far.</br> </br> </br>   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot</br>   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from LA&quot;, and it's good to be</br>   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.</br>   Things change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out,  skipping class, Police, Treatment by, Mentors"></span>nded on 59th and Vermont.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who were you living with when they were away?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My grandparents.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In Mexico city?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mm-hmm (affirmative) They were taking care of us. Me and my sister.</br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to leave them?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that</br>   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your</br>   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at</br>   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: But I mean they treat us good. It was just little things that you</br>   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was</br>   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good</br>   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our</br>   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to</br>   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't</br>   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my</br>   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want</br>   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to</br>   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and</br>   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he</br>   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell</br>   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two</br>   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught</br>   me how to cut the corn.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't</br>   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he</br>   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He</br>   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you</br>   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so</br>   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We</br>   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come</br>   and you know, hear him speak.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he was a politician?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take</br>   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be</br>   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,</br>   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to</br>   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: He was like, &quot;don't worry&quot;. He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little</br>   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then</br>   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is</br>   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A corral?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't</br>   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a</br>   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the</br>   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little</br>   ranch.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and</br>   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we</br>   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of</br>   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they</br>   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the</br>   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually</br>   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were</br>   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to</br>   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making</br>   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.</br>   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they</br>   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year was this?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Gangs, Affiliation, Camaraderie/family, Family, Fitting in, Gangs, Fights, Homelife, Family, Fights, Arguments/Estrangement, Teenage rebellion">Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;     Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,   they didn't love me.&quot;     Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you   are already ready for that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Gangs, Affiliation, Fitting in, Police: US, Mistreatment by, Racial profiling, Feelings, Frustration">Anita: You were part of a gang.

Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay.

Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?     Anita: A corral?     Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little   ranch.     Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, &quot;I live in LA.   Tell him to bring you guys here.&quot; And they took us there. I remember they   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexican childhood, Memories, Family, Grandparents">Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught   me how to cut the corn.     Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come   and you know, hear him speak.     Anita: But he was a politician?     Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexican childhood, Memories, Family, Family Separation">Anita: Who were you living with when they were away?     Ruben: My grandparents.     Anita: In Mexico city?     Ruben: Mm-hmm (affirmative) They were taking care of us. Me and my sister.   Yeah.     Anita: Was it hard to leave them?     Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.     Ruben: But I mean they treat us good.</span> It was just little things that you</br>   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was</br>   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't</br>   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with</br>   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.</br>   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the</br>   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my</br>   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So they left after your sister died?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How much younger than you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben : Probably like four years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Four years.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,</br>   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right</br>   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,</br>   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.</br>   They showed us to, to respect our elders.

He was like, &quot;I mean, that's your mom.&quot;</br>   Right? But he was like, &quot;I don't want you to leave.&quot; It was hard for him,</br>   for me too. But my sister, she was like, &quot;No I want to go with my mom.&quot; But</br>   that's when we actually came over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for</br>   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana.

Right</br>   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six</br>   years before that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.</br>   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,</br>   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so</br>   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like</br>   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take</br>   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,</br>   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got</br>   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started</br>   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like</br>   living in the garage cause I was like, &quot;isn't this for a car?&quot; My mom would</br>   be like, &quot;yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where</br>   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there</br>   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.</br>   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could</br>   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I</br>   couldn't say, &quot;Hey, can I borrow your pencil?&quot; I will do it with signs,</br>   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in</br>   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because</br>   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,</br>   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or</br>   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,</br>   &quot;huh?&quot; And they would be like, &quot;You know on your bike? You know your</br>   helmet? Let’s go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old</br>   were you and what it was like</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it</br>   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,</br>   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It</br>   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at</br>   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African</br>   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,</br>   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day</br>   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It</br>   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it</br>   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought</br>   they were going to hit us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The rioters?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,</br>   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to</br>   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just</br>   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was</br>   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to</br>   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, &quot;Go get</br>   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.&quot; We actually</br>   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.</br>   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, &quot;Stay inside.&quot; You</br>   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless</br>   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it</br>   looked like a big ball of fire.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real</br>   cheap.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just</br>   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine</br>   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with</br>   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My</br>   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they</br>   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit</br>   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was</br>   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, &quot;Go get</br>   me a game, go get me a game.&quot; Something to keep her busy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community</br>   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it</br>   will be only with certain people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I</br>   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to</br>   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,</br>   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But</br>   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but</br>   took us like around nine months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was</br>   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was</br>   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all</br>   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to</br>   them. We just try to go day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize</br>   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my</br>   mom was like, &quot;Don't go out, they might hurt us.&quot; But we still, we really,</br>   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually</br>   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I</br>   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in</br>   gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well</br>   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick</br>   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking</br>   you and poking you saying, &quot;What are you doing? What do you have in your</br>   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.&quot;</br>   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are</br>   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards</br>   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me</br>   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type</br>   of anger like, &quot;Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?&quot; Because with</br>   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,</br>   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I</br>   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the</br>   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he</br>   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But</br>   at the same time, I wasn't legal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing</br>   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole</br>   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,</br>   &quot;I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are</br>   now.&quot; I said, &quot;Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.&quot; I said, &quot;I</br>   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some</br>   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,</br>   taking them to a Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police</br>   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's</br>   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our</br>   shoes.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come</br>   to your door and knock and say, &quot;What do you have in your pockets?&quot; I will</br>   say, &quot;Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.&quot; He will say, &quot;I know. You're</br>   just a person I like to mess with.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up</br>   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I</br>   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was</br>   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little</br>   more.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the</br>   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and</br>   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of</br>   that, it actually starts making us say, &quot;Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,</br>   just seeing what you do.&quot; So, you start growing some type of anger towards</br>   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and</br>   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,</br>   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both</br>   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, &quot;Man,</br>   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or</br>   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards</br>   them, &quot;Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.&quot; I</br>   always said, &quot;It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,</br>   they didn't love me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with</br>   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those</br>   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told</br>   her, &quot;Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger</br>   on the streets.&quot; So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,</br>   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an</br>   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you</br>   are already ready for that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that the third thing?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you</br>   to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do they do it?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real</br>   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but</br>   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would</br>   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? &quot;Hey,</br>   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,&quot; and that will be a</br>   group of gang members.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why do they kick them out?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn</br>   the good way, &quot;All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.&quot; They</br>   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too</br>   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I</br>   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Piece of broom?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, &quot;You better go home,&quot; but she wouldn't hit me.</br>   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and</br>   that I didn't want to be a gang member, &quot;Stay away from him.&quot; My friends</br>   were laughing, saying, &quot;Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit</br>   us?&quot; I said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So if you were asked, &quot;How can we prevent this from happening so</br>   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?&quot; What would</br>   you say?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a</br>   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were</br>   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good</br>   students, and we had good grades-</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and</br>   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.</br>   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go</br>   to Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,</br>   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp;amp; Girls</br>   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was</br>   like, &quot;So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those</br>   guys.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's</br>   how everything starts involving it, &quot;Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to</br>   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably</br>   might have been different?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I</br>   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from</br>   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like three times and</br>   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they</br>   put me on probation for a year. My probation officer was actually the</br>   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.</br>   The greatest one was going to see the Lakers. he took me there. He was the</br>   first one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I</br>   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club, so what did I</br>   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.</br>   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed</br>   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I</br>   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.</br>   &quot;Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.&quot; I took the blame for both of</br>   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his</br>   house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: By?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.</br>   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me</br>   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool</br>   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,</br>   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front</br>   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.</br>   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, &quot;You guys are</br>   brothers, but from different mothers.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when this happened?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he</br>   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He</br>   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she</br>   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see</br>   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.</br>   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the</br>   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to</br>   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA</br>   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep</br>   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about</br>   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my</br>   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little</br>   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have</br>   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,</br>   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a</br>   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring</br>   them there.</br> </br> </br>   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have</br>   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our</br>   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,</br>   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but</br>   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park</br>   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of</br>   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that</br>   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never</br>   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never</br>   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the</br>   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another</br>   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,</br>   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had</br>   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at</br>   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that</br>   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we</br>   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and</br>   say, &quot;Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not</br>   talking about what we do.&quot; Things that a lot of people don't know. That's</br>   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got</br>   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to</br>   handle.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that</br>   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of</br>   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't</br>   have to watch my back and say, &quot;What neighborhood am I in?&quot;. The only thing</br>   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area</br>   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to</br>   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying</br>   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.</br>   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, &quot;Is that your mom</br>   right there behind you?&quot; And I said &quot;Yes, she is.&quot; &quot;Well, you better thank</br>   her, because she just gave you life again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same</br>   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of</br>   people say, &quot;Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new</br>   president...&quot; It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.</br>   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,</br>   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment</br>   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come</br>   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to</br>   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. &quot;Oh, my</br>   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.&quot;, &quot;Hey, I can fix it.&quot;, stuff like</br>   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside</br>   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put</br>   it in them. I try to tell them, &quot;I'm going to give you a little bit of</br>   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by</br>   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people</br>   saying &quot;Hi&quot; to me. &quot;Hey, hi Ruben&quot; How have you been? You all right?&quot; They</br>   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, are you hungry?&quot; And they've got little taquitos puesto or</br>   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I</br>   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, &quot;No, no&quot;.</br>   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because</br>   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,</br>   I'd be like &quot;Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11&quot;, but if</br>   you have it clean, people will be like, &quot;Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit</br>   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,</br>   because they would say, &quot;Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?&quot;</br>   and I'll look back and say &quot;I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.&quot; I</br>   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at</br>   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can</br>   walk by, and I would ask ladies, &quot;Why do you move? If I'm giving you the</br>   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not</br>   going to take your stuff.&quot; On the other hand, I will probably even help you</br>   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are</br>   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, &quot;Look, if you help me do</br>   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.&quot; They used to get</br>   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,</br>   &quot;Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I'll be</br>   there right now.&quot; That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.</br>   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the</br>   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,</br>   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the</br>   environment right now with the same people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when</br>   they got here. A lot of these guys think, &quot;Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just</br>   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me</br>   something.&quot; and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, &quot;Hey man,</br>   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.&quot; People will</br>   be like &quot;Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.&quot; I work right here.</br>   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.</br>   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,</br>   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does</br>   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his</br>   money.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, &quot;I seen you on</br>   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your</br>   stuff.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I never seen you taking money. I never see you not</br>   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how</br>   much did you make?&quot; No, he just comes and be like, &quot;Hey, thanks man. Are</br>   you hungry? Do you need anything?&quot; He'll give you money, and on the side</br>   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, &quot;No man, you don't have to</br>   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay</br>   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the</br>   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.&quot;</br>   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que</br>   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who</br>   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to</br>   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks</br>   with them and these are the guys that tell me, &quot;I know everybody here. I</br>   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.&quot; I walk with them and</br>   they see when everybody's like, &quot;Hey, how have you been? Where have you</br>   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?</br>   Can I help you out in getting you some job?&quot; And they just look at me and</br>   be like, &quot;Why are they interested on helping you?&quot; And that's when I tell</br>   them &quot;That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,</br>   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I</br>   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.&quot; If they</br>   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's</br>   them. People are different.</br> </br> </br>   And they see it and some people will be like, &quot;Ah, yeah, you're nice.&quot; And</br>   I say &quot;No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really</br>   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,</br>   past.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have</br>   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,</br>   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right</br>   away with them. I'll be like, &quot;Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve</br>   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it</br>   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to</br>   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is</br>   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did</br>   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it.&quot;</br>   There's people that don't think. They just act.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five</br>   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government</br>   people that used to come, they liked me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had left the gangs.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they</br>   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still</br>   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's</br>   when you react and say, &quot;Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.&quot; I</br>   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or</br>   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually</br>   able to do something right instead of just thinking, &quot;Well I'll just shoot</br>   them and it will end.&quot; No. We're humans. We just talk it out.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them</br>   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they</br>   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, &quot;Hey, buenas tardes&quot;,</br>   they look at you like &quot;What's good about?&quot; but they have to get to like</br>   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,</br>   &quot;You're the first-&quot; she calls us cholos- &quot;You're the first cholo that I</br>   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.&quot; She tells me, &quot;Hey, can you clean</br>   up my garden?&quot; I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll</br>   say &quot;How come you never charge us for what you do for us?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the word &quot;cholo&quot;?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Gangster.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That’s the meaning?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the</br>   little walk, you're a cholo.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is it like your mark?</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call</br>   me &quot;cholo&quot;, a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a</br>   month, they will be like &quot;What's your name? I don't want to be calling you</br>   &quot;cholo&quot;. What's your real name?&quot; &quot;Ruben.&quot; &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Now they call me</br>   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around</br>   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My</br>   neighbors, I would talk to them, &quot;Good morning&quot;. I would sweep the whole</br>   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, &quot;Why you</br>   sweeping in front of my house?&quot; I'd be like, &quot;I don't know. I felt like it,</br>   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash</br>   back.&quot; But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like</br>   &quot;Ruben will clean''.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that</br>   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it</br>   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that</br>   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid</br>   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing</br>   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that</br>   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually</br>   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get</br>   flooded.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You gave a service, then.</br> </br> </br>   Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy</br>   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what</br>   I would tell them. &quot;You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys</br>   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it</br>   up so the water can just flow&quot; Now when I go back, they say they want me</br>   back in that block. It's too far.</br> </br> </br>   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot</br>   of these people don't see it. They just, &quot;I'm from LA&quot;, and it's good to be</br>   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.</br>   Things change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
