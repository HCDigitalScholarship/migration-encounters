   Anita: I want to hear, first of all, why you migrated? Why did you go to<br>
   the states? How old were you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: 5 or 4. We migrated because of the money situation that we had. We<br>
   had what I remember as a pretty low income. My dad couldn't keep a stable<br>
   job. He would actually work in the mornings and in the afternoons he would<br>
   be fixing neighbors cars, their toilet, their shower head, their sinks,<br>
   paint houses, but it wasn't enough. So we didn't actually come together.<br>
   They came to the United States, were there for nine months, saved up some<br>
   money, and then they came back and got me and my sister. They went over<br>
   there, worked, saved money, and then they came back for us and that's when<br>
   we landed on 59th and Vermont.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Who were you living with when they were away?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: My grandparents.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: In Mexico city?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Mm-hmm (affirmative) They were taking care of us. Me and my sister.<br>
   Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was it hard to leave them?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that<br>
   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your<br>
   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at<br>
   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: But I mean they treat us good. It was just little things that you<br>
   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was<br>
   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't<br>
   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with<br>
   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.<br>
   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the<br>
   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my<br>
   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So they left after your sister died?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. She would've been right now, 35.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How much younger than you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben : Probably like four years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Four years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: My other sister right now is 31.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So your sister, is she still in the states, the 31year old?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, the younger one. Yeah. She's still there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So did you like living with your grandparents or not?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,<br>
   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right<br>
   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,<br>
   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.<br>
   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good<br>
   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our<br>
   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to<br>
   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't<br>
   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my<br>
   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want<br>
   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to<br>
   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and<br>
   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he<br>
   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell<br>
   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two<br>
   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught<br>
   me how to cut the corn.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't<br>
   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he<br>
   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He<br>
   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you<br>
   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so<br>
   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We<br>
   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come<br>
   and you know, hear him speak.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But he was a politician?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take<br>
   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be<br>
   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,<br>
   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like. But I had two days to<br>
   think about it and at the end I was like, no, I'm going to go with my mom.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: He was like, "don't worry". He was like, "I mean, that's your mom."<br>
   Right? But he was like, "I don't want you to leave." It was hard for him,<br>
   for me too. But my sister, she was like, "No I want to go with my mom." But<br>
   that's when we actually came over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How'd you cross the border?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for<br>
   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little<br>
   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then<br>
   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is<br>
   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: A corral?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't<br>
   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a<br>
   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the<br>
   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little<br>
   ranch.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and<br>
   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we<br>
   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of<br>
   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they<br>
   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the<br>
   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually<br>
   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were<br>
   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to<br>
   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making<br>
   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, "I live in LA.<br>
   Tell him to bring you guys here." And they took us there. I remember they<br>
   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What year was this?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: 86. And that's where we landed in LA, around 59th street. Right<br>
   before the Rodney King riot. It was like a few years. Well I think like six<br>
   years before that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.<br>
   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,<br>
   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so<br>
   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like<br>
   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take<br>
   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,<br>
   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got<br>
   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started<br>
   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like<br>
   living in the garage cause I was like, "isn't this for a car?" My mom would<br>
   be like, "yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where<br>
   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there<br>
   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.<br>
   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could<br>
   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I<br>
   couldn't say, "Hey, can I borrow your pencil?" I will do it with signs,<br>
   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in<br>
   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because<br>
   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,<br>
   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or<br>
   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,<br>
   "huh?" And they would be like, "You know on your bike? You know your<br>
   helmet? Let’s go."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Earlier you alluded to the Rodney King riots. So tell me, how old<br>
   were you and what it was like<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it<br>
   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,<br>
   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It<br>
   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at<br>
   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African<br>
   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,<br>
   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day<br>
   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It<br>
   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it<br>
   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought<br>
   they were going to hit us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: The rioters?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,<br>
   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to<br>
   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just<br>
   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was<br>
   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to<br>
   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, "Go get<br>
   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time." We actually<br>
   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.<br>
   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, "Stay inside." You<br>
   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless<br>
   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it<br>
   looked like a big ball of fire.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Payless Shoes, it used to be a store of shoes that were real, real<br>
   cheap.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Maybe I would say well like $3, in between three and 10. It was just<br>
   something that I can, if I just close my eyes you can actually imagine<br>
   exactly everything, how it was happening, even though it's been years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with<br>
   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My<br>
   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they<br>
   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit<br>
   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was<br>
   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, "Go get<br>
   me a game, go get me a game." Something to keep her busy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community<br>
   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it<br>
   will be only with certain people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I<br>
   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to<br>
   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,<br>
   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But<br>
   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but<br>
   took us like around nine months.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How do you feel about African Americans?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Basically, I'm not really racist, you know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I mean my best friend is actually African-America. At school it was<br>
   different because they would bully us, they will try to say the bench was<br>
   theirs. Don't sit there, you cannot sit nowhere. We couldn’t understand all<br>
   the bad words they will say to us, but we never really pay attention to<br>
   them. We just try to go day by day.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But could you understand why they were the riots? Did you sympathize<br>
   with Rodney King or did you feel like this was crazy?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: At the time we just thought, everybody was just going crazy and my<br>
   mom was like, "Don't go out, they might hurt us." But we still, we really,<br>
   kind of curious though, but I never got anything against them. I actually<br>
   understood when basically you see the news, when they explaining, I<br>
   understood their anger, but we thought that was not the way to solve it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in<br>
   gangs?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well<br>
   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick<br>
   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking<br>
   you and poking you saying, "What are you doing? What do you have in your<br>
   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head."<br>
   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are<br>
   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards<br>
   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me<br>
   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I<br>
   do?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type<br>
   of anger like, "Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?" Because with<br>
   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,<br>
   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I<br>
   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the<br>
   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he<br>
   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But<br>
   at the same time, I wasn't legal.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How old were you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing<br>
   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole<br>
   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,<br>
   "I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are<br>
   now." I said, "Look, everybody has a choice and I made one." I said, "I<br>
   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some<br>
   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,<br>
   taking them to a Boys &amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police<br>
   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's<br>
   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our<br>
   shoes."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come<br>
   to your door and knock and say, "What do you have in your pockets?" I will<br>
   say, "Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house." He will say, "I know. You're<br>
   just a person I like to mess with."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up<br>
   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I<br>
   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was<br>
   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little<br>
   more.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the<br>
   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and<br>
   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of<br>
   that, it actually starts making us say, "Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,<br>
   just seeing what you do." So, you start growing some type of anger towards<br>
   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and<br>
   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,<br>
   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both<br>
   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, "Man,<br>
   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or<br>
   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards<br>
   them, "Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family." I<br>
   always said, "It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,<br>
   they didn't love me."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with<br>
   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those<br>
   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told<br>
   her, "Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger<br>
   on the streets." So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,<br>
   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an<br>
   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you<br>
   are already ready for that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Is that the third thing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you<br>
   to do that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How do they do it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real<br>
   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but<br>
   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would<br>
   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? "Hey,<br>
   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house," and that will be a<br>
   group of gang members.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why do they kick them out?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn<br>
   the good way, "All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way." They<br>
   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too<br>
   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I<br>
   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Piece of broom?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, "You better go home," but she wouldn't hit me.<br>
   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and<br>
   that I didn't want to be a gang member, "Stay away from him." My friends<br>
   were laughing, saying, "Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit<br>
   us?" I said, "I don't know."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So if you were asked, "How can we prevent this from happening so<br>
   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?" What would<br>
   you say?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a<br>
   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were<br>
   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good<br>
   students, and we had good grades-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and<br>
   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.<br>
   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go<br>
   to Boys &amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,<br>
   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp; Girls<br>
   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was<br>
   like, "So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those<br>
   guys."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's<br>
   how everything starts involving it, "Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to<br>
   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you think that if your membership hadn't expired, you probably<br>
   might have been different?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, it actually would have, because I was the type of kid that I<br>
   will go to the police station. I already had probation for something from<br>
   school. I think it was from ditching school. I ditched like three times and<br>
   they put me on probation. My mom didn't want me to go to the house, so they<br>
   put me on probation for a year. My probation officer was actually the<br>
   coolest guy. He would take me fishing. He would take me to little events.<br>
   The greatest one was going to see the Lakers. he took me there. He was the<br>
   first one that took me there, and I enjoyed it. When he retired, well I<br>
   didn't have him, I didn't have the Boys &amp; Girls Club, so what did I<br>
   have? The streets. So, that's what you turn to.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up<br>
   together.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.<br>
   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed<br>
   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I<br>
   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.<br>
   "Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail." I took the blame for both of<br>
   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his<br>
   house.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: By?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.<br>
   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me<br>
   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool<br>
   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,<br>
   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front<br>
   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.<br>
   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, "You guys are<br>
   brothers, but from different mothers."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How old were you when this happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Just a kid?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he<br>
   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He<br>
   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she<br>
   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see<br>
   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.<br>
   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the<br>
   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to<br>
   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA<br>
   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep<br>
   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about<br>
   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my<br>
   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little<br>
   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have<br>
   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,<br>
   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a<br>
   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring<br>
   them there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have<br>
   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our<br>
   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,<br>
   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but<br>
   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park<br>
   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of<br>
   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that<br>
   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never<br>
   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never<br>
   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the<br>
   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another<br>
   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,<br>
   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had<br>
   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at<br>
   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that<br>
   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we<br>
   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and<br>
   say, "Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not<br>
   talking about what we do." Things that a lot of people don't know. That's<br>
   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got<br>
   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to<br>
   handle.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So how has your life changed after being deported?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that<br>
   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of<br>
   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't<br>
   have to watch my back and say, "What neighborhood am I in?". The only thing<br>
   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area<br>
   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to<br>
   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying<br>
   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.<br>
   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, "Is that your mom<br>
   right there behind you?" And I said "Yes, she is." "Well, you better thank<br>
   her, because she just gave you life again."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you ever have the idea of joining another gang in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same<br>
   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of<br>
   people say, "Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new<br>
   president..." It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.<br>
   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,<br>
   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment<br>
   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come<br>
   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to<br>
   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. "Oh, my<br>
   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.", "Hey, I can fix it.", stuff like<br>
   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside<br>
   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put<br>
   it in them. I try to tell them, "I'm going to give you a little bit of<br>
   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by<br>
   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people<br>
   saying "Hi" to me. "Hey, hi Ruben" How have you been? You all right?" They<br>
   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be<br>
   like, "Hey, are you hungry?" And they've got little taquitos puesto or<br>
   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I<br>
   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, "No, no".<br>
   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because<br>
   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,<br>
   I'd be like "Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11", but if<br>
   you have it clean, people will be like, "Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit<br>
   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,<br>
   because they would say, "Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?"<br>
   and I'll look back and say "I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here." I<br>
   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at<br>
   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can<br>
   walk by, and I would ask ladies, "Why do you move? If I'm giving you the<br>
   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not<br>
   going to take your stuff." On the other hand, I will probably even help you<br>
   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are<br>
   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways<br>
   to help me out.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, "Look, if you help me do<br>
   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it." They used to get<br>
   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,<br>
   "Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?" "Yeah, I'll be<br>
   there right now." That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.<br>
   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the<br>
   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,<br>
   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the<br>
   environment right now with the same people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when<br>
   they got here. A lot of these guys think, "Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just<br>
   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me<br>
   something." and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, "Hey man,<br>
   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on." People will<br>
   be like "Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me." I work right here.<br>
   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.<br>
   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,<br>
   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does<br>
   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his<br>
   money.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, "I seen you on<br>
   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your<br>
   stuff." And he goes, "I never seen you taking money. I never see you not<br>
   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how<br>
   much did you make?" No, he just comes and be like, "Hey, thanks man. Are<br>
   you hungry? Do you need anything?" He'll give you money, and on the side<br>
   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, "No man, you don't have to<br>
   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay<br>
   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the<br>
   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn."<br>
   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que<br>
   me vean diferente (I don’t want to be seen differently), you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who<br>
   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to<br>
   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks<br>
   with them and these are the guys that tell me, "I know everybody here. I<br>
   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me." I walk with them and<br>
   they see when everybody's like, "Hey, how have you been? Where have you<br>
   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?<br>
   Can I help you out in getting you some job?" And they just look at me and<br>
   be like, "Why are they interested on helping you?" And that's when I tell<br>
   them "That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,<br>
   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I<br>
   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon." If they<br>
   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's<br>
   them. People are different.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   And they see it and some people will be like, "Ah, yeah, you're nice." And<br>
   I say "No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really<br>
   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,<br>
   past."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So you can get that neighborhood out of your blood, then?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: It's always going to be in your heart. You're always going to have<br>
   that attitude. But to me, I only use it when it's needed. Somebody comes,<br>
   tries to show me he's tougher or anything, I'm not going to fight right<br>
   away with them. I'll be like, "Hey, look, is there a way that we can solve<br>
   this? Because fighting is not going to solve it. It's going to make it<br>
   worse, but if you're still wanting to fight, I mean, boy, I'm not going to<br>
   back down, but let's try to tuck it, tuck it up. Explain to me what it is<br>
   that you're feeling. How do you feel that I disrespected you? And what did<br>
   I say that you didn't like? Then I can explain to you why I said it."<br>
   There's people that don't think. They just act.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you think you could have changed If you hadn't been deported?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I haven't really changed. I had a job. I worked at my job for five<br>
   years. Worked with helicopter parts from the government. The government<br>
   people that used to come, they liked me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So you had left the gangs.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they<br>
   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still<br>
   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's<br>
   when you react and say, "Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too." I<br>
   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or<br>
   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually<br>
   able to do something right instead of just thinking, "Well I'll just shoot<br>
   them and it will end." No. We're humans. We just talk it out.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them<br>
   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they<br>
   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, "Hey, buenas tardes",<br>
   they look at you like "What's good about?" but they have to get to like<br>
   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,<br>
   "You're the first-" she calls us cholos- "You're the first cholo that I<br>
   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice." She tells me, "Hey, can you clean<br>
   up my garden?" I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll<br>
   say "How come you never charge us for what you do for us?"<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: About the word "cholo"?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Gangster.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: That’s the meaning?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Yeah. You about hit it. You've got the gold teeth, you got the<br>
   little walk, you're a cholo.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Is it like your mark?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call<br>
   me "cholo", a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a<br>
   month, they will be like "What's your name? I don't want to be calling you<br>
   "cholo". What's your real name?" "Ruben." "Oh, okay." Now they call me<br>
   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around<br>
   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My<br>
   neighbors, I would talk to them, "Good morning". I would sweep the whole<br>
   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, "Why you<br>
   sweeping in front of my house?" I'd be like, "I don't know. I felt like it,<br>
   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash<br>
   back." But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like<br>
   "Ruben will clean''.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that<br>
   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it<br>
   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that<br>
   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid<br>
   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing<br>
   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that<br>
   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually<br>
   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get<br>
   flooded.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You gave a service, then.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy<br>
   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what<br>
   I would tell them. "You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys<br>
   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it<br>
   up so the water can just flow" Now when I go back, they say they want me<br>
   back in that block. It's too far.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot<br>
   of these people don't see it. They just, "I'm from LA", and it's good to be<br>
   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.<br>
   Things change.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Thank you so much.<br>
