Actually, my parents, they're from</br>   a small village <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">around thirty minutes</span> from the city. The village is really</br>   small. As I remember, we used to have dirt houses, small dirt houses. What</br>   else? We didn't have any… Like the roads, it's like dust and ground, like</br>   raw ground roads. What else? I remember that the people, they used to were</br>   more kind. it was just love everywhere in my childhood. I used to be</br>   shepherd, I used to have a sheep. I used to go to the mountains with my</br>   sheeps, trying to feed them and everything. I used to have one small cow. I</br>   used to have two horses and everything. After I immigrate to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> with</br>   none <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, I went there, live with my brother <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, and I started went</br>   to school, and started looking for a job actually. I was underage, so my</br>   parents have to sign off the sheet for me to get a job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">fifteen</span> at that time, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">fifteen</span>. Yeah, you're not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">sixteen</span>, I think, you cannot work over</br>   there. I was just having a little, small part-time. After that I went to</br>   ___ High School. I went there and after I moved to ____, which is, I got my</br>   GED from there. Well, it was just fine. I was growing up, making friends</br>   and everything. I got used to the city. I got used to, how can I say?</br>   Literally, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>, it swallowed me right away. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It swallowed you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, it swallowed me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: How do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Well, to get me into, how you say, the living style over there. I</br>   adapted very well. I graduate, I start moving by myself. I move into my own</br>   apartment. My own connections. After that, I became a chef. It was a little</br>   bit of an expert on the kitchen. I got an offer, a job offer, from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Iowa</span></br>   about a restaurant opening. They offered me a pretty good salary, and I</br>   didn't have to pay rent, so I didn't think twice about moving out there. I</br>   opened the restaurant. They were really happy with my work. They were doing</br>   very well. I set up everything right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Well after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span>, I decided to return to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span> because I</br>   thought I was missing the weather because it's really cold over there in</br>   Iowa. Well, after I saw the living expenses in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span> and living</br>   expenses in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Iowa</span>, I make my statement. I was like, “No, I'm not staying in</br>   California anymore.” Then I decided to move for good to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Iowa</span>. I went to</br>   WITCC [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Western Iowa Tech Community College</span>]. I was trying to go for a</br>   dentist.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That was the community college that you went to?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, the community college. It was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year and a half</span> only, but it</br>   was only in generals before I decided what to do. I was undecided between</br>   being a dentist or a medical assistant. I was just going to generals before</br>   I decide, and I was making my own investigation about salaries—<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   priority was money, then timing, and then work bills and everything around</br>   the community. Luckily, I didn't get to really get into the college about</br>   my major. Well, after I return, I came to my small village—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Let's back up just a little bit to what led to you getting deported.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I was just having a good time with a friend. I was not the driver.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span>, we got detained for swinging lines.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Swinging lines, like roughly driving, like reckless driving. Well, we</br>   were kind of a little bit of drinking. They were like, “Okay, drinking and</br>   driving.” I was like, “Oh well.” I thought I was not going to get arrested,</br>   but the people decide to arrest me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You weren't the driver?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I wasn't the driver, no.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Your friend was arrested for reckless driving, and what was your</br>   charge?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: We charged for… Because that guy had an open container. It wasn't a</br>   beer, but it was just a small glass from the bar that he took. They decided</br>   to charge us both with open container. When I got into—well they just</br>   detained me. Well, they scanned me literally, they run all my information,</br>   they didn't find any social security number. That's how they called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span>.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> literally detained me for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a month</span> before I decided to sign on my</br>   deportation because I was sick of the jail. I was just tired and</br>   everything. I speak to the judge once, “Okay, we'll see you for the next</br>   court.” I was like, “No.” I was so sick already because I spent in County</br>   for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about four months</span> as I remember, and then <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one more month</span> with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span>. I</br>   was just sick of it. I was like, “No, I just want to go.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You decided you would rather leave and be deported back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   than stay in detention longer?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Uh-huh. I was like, ”No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What were the conditions like in detention?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Detention, it's just disgusting. It's just disgusting. There's hair</br>   everywhere. Everything is dirty. It smells. The beds are hard. They give</br>   you like, a little mattress like this, and it's just plastic. No, it's</br>   undescribable. If you've never been there, it's undescribable. You can't</br>   sleep because you always have to be aware. You never know who's going to</br>   come through that door or who's going to be sleeping with you on the next</br>   bunker. Yeah, it's rough. And you get sick there. I was just sick of it. I</br>   was like, give me my deportation. I just want to go.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: How did they treat you there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Not bad, but they always intimidating, like trying to ... It's like</br>   you are in jail, I guess. They don't want anyone to feel that they can make</br>   whatever they want with them, or trying to intimidate the [inaudible], or</br>   any other type of misconduct, I would say.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah, misconduct.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, it's just hard. It’s undescribable.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What was the food like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: It's just gross. The portions are none literally. Sometimes they give</br>   you rotten milk—just little boxes, like little milk boxes, like a little</br>   carton thing. Yeah, so sometimes there's hair in the food. Sometimes it's</br>   just the portions, literally, they just like shoved in like a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">half</span> of a</br>   spoon, just throw it in there. What else besides the hair..?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You were hungry a lot?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah there was a lot of hunger in there. You can't save food either.</br>   Cause I remember we used to save the peanut butter sandwich to keep it for</br>   later on, for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">late night</span>, so we wouldn't get hungry. They would search you</br>   so if they found you everything that's ... They will penalize you, either</br>   with the hole and everything, or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">twenty-four hours</span> locked in. It's kind of</br>   hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Big punishment just for trying to save food for later?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah. Well... [Chuckles]. You're in there, you can't do anything.</br>   You're just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> more number and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> more inmate.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Were any of your family members or friends able to come visit you</br>   while you were in detention?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: No. I was just by myself. My only family, they all stay in California,</br>   and I was by myself in ____, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Iowa</span>. I didn't really want to call them,</br>   because they say [inaudible] They were never going to support me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: They wouldn't support you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Can you tell me more about that? They wouldn't support you in terms</br>   of that they would be upset with you, or just that they wouldn't help you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I think they would help me, but they would be disappointed of me.</br>   They'd say, “Why you do this?” or something like that. I rather not to call</br>   them or tell them about...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: They didn't know that you were detained?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: No, they didn't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: When did they find out?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: When I got deported. [Chuckles]. When I got deported, I got released</br>   on… What's it called? <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nuevo Laredo</span>, it's like the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span> border. I got</br>   released over there, and then I called my brother because he owes me money.</br>   I called him just to tell him I'm here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nuevo Laredo</span>. Send me some money</br>   because I got to come home. [Chuckles]. Well, yeah, that's how they found</br>   out I got deported. I'm pretty sure they would’ve helped me; they gave me</br>   some money. But after that, no. That's when I got here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you remember what it was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">that day</span> crossing the bridge from</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Texas</span> back into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah. I will never forget that. They just gave you this small bag with</br>   your belongs, [Chuckles] which is like clothes from jail, so they're not</br>   really good. They give you small needs, like a bag with needs, with</br>   everything. They just release you. They take all the chains off. They're</br>   just like, “Get off the bus, walk across the bridge.” That's it. Well, you</br>   had to cross it. [Chuckle]. What other choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What did you do when you were across the bridge?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I was a little scared, a little excited about a new thing, but I was</br>   just thinking too much—like I don't have money, where am I going to go?</br>   What I going to do? There was a lot of rumors about the cartels recruiting</br>   immigrants as soon as you cross the bridge; they going to make you get into</br>   a car, and they going to take you from there. If you with them or not, they</br>   going to kill you. I was just looking around like, “Where's the car?</br>   Where's the car?” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Did you have any experience like that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: No, not really. Luckily, I got welcomed by this group of people—the</br>   one I mentioned. They literally just went, “Okay, where are you going?” I'm</br>   like, “Oh, I'm going to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guerrero</span>.” “Okay, so listen. We are from the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government. We here to assist you and help with everything that you</br>   might need.” I was like, “Okay.” “Just come with us.” it was a little scary</br>   because they say, “Okay, just come with us,” and they just take you around</br>   the building. You don't even know, what other choice do you have? You</br>   either stay with them or just stay in the street?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And you're not sure whether it's safe to—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, whatever.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: No other choice?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: They say they from the government and they have a little logo, a</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> logo, so I was like, “Okay. I'm going to just go with them. Whatever</br>   happens is going to happen.” They give you access to computers to</br>   communicate with your family and everything. That's when I got in contact</br>   with my brother. I was just like, “Send me some money here. I'm going to</br>   need for my bus ride at least.” Then one of the guys heard me: “Hey, where</br>   did you say you were from?” I'm like, “I'm from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guerrero</span>.” “Oh, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Guerrero</span>, I</br>   think <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guerrero</span> have some programs about immigrants from their state. It’s</br>   their people, and they take care of them.” Yeah, if you're an immigrant</br>   from my state like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guerrero</span>, and you were born there, they will pay you. If</br>   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,</br>   and not even <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">five minutes</span>, they will be answering you with the</br>   approve—well, the bus will have to take you to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guerrero</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: To take you to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guerrero</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: It was nice, I was like, “Okay.” I just told my brother to send me</br>   money to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guerrero</span>. I get to my house. That was it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What did that feel like being back in your home?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: [Exhale]. It was just awful. As I say, nobody knew me. I didn't know</br>   nobody besides my family, my close friends and family, close family.</br>   Besides my neighbors, they didn't know who I was. I didn't know who they</br>   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids</br>   five years old, they were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">almost twenty-five</span> by then. I was like, “No.” It</br>   was exciting getting to know more people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Did you feel like you were returning home, or did you feel like an</br>   outsider?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I felt like an outsider. Yeah, definitely an outsider. Well,</br>   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.</br>   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you</br>   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or</br>   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just</br>   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I</br>   was like, “No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How long did you stay there before you came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">About one year</span>. I've been living <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span> here. I've been jumping job</br>   by job. Some jobs did not accept me because I don’t have the high school</br>   diploma—that's why I'm trying to get it. Luckily, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">T-Tech</span> they accept you.</br>   They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As</br>   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you like working at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">T-Tech</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I've only been working there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two weeks</span>, but I think I'm going to</br>   like a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What do you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to</br>   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high</br>   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There’s no…</br>   a lot of people speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> better than me, like, “Go eff yourself.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs</br>   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't</br>   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the</br>   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">80%</span> of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three months</span>. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is</br>   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,</br>   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for</br>   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of</br>   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I</br>   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the</br>   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.</br>   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went</br>   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the</br>   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying</br>   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to</br>   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you</br>   guys thinking about?”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Sounds like you had a different work ethic than your coworkers</br>   there. Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span></br>   culture, I guess? In the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>, you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and</br>   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I</br>   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really</br>   ask for rewards and everything. I remember <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> time, a lady—a messy girl</br>   from the streets, I think she was homeless—she showed up at the restaurant,</br>   and was like, “Hey, is this yours?” It was my wallet. I was like, “Yeah.</br>   Where you found it?” “Here. There's a lot of money in there, so take care</br>   of it.” I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was</br>   like, “Hey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you</br>   want.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: She was like, “Oh no no, I got to go. I got to go.” I was like, “You</br>   sure? Come on, let me cook something for you. You can have it for later.</br>   You can have it for to go. “No no, no, thank you, thank you, thank you.”</br>   She just left. I was like, “Wow.” And here, I already lost my wallet once.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Nobody returned it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I ain't got no call. I got nothing. I got nothing for it. That's what</br>   I hate about this.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You had mentioned in the survey you got attacked and your belongings</br>   stolen. Can you tell me about that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Oh yeah. I was hanging out with my friend. She's a girl, short girl,</br>   and I didn't really know. Those guys, they came to us with the knives. They</br>   pull out the knives. They came to me, they put a knife on my neck, and</br>   another one in my stomach, like say, “Don't move, don't move.” But as they</br>   say that, I didn't show that I was afraid of them. I was just like, “Okay,</br>   calm down. Take whatever you want. Don't do anything stupid, something like</br>   that.” I didn't want to do anything—hit back or something and run</br>   away—because I was with the girl. I was just more scared about her. She was</br>   super scared. I was like, “Just take that, just go.” Yeah, after that,</br>   there was a police station <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> blocks from there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Did you go to the police?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, we went to the police. She filed a report and everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What did they do? Nothing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Nothing. Nothing at all. I don't think she got contacted or something,</br>   and I don't think they did something. It's just like a regular thing around</br>   here. You get jacked and they steal your stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You had said that you don't feel safe in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: No. To be honest, I don't feel safe. I'm always on guard, like</br>   everything. When I see people, as long as I’m by myself, and I see people</br>   getting close to me, I'm going to get just on guard. I see something you're</br>   trying to do to me, I'm just going to scream and run. [Chuckle]. I don't</br>   feel safe. I’m always aware. When I'm on the subway, on the streets, I'm</br>   always checking my pockets around, “Oh, I still have my wallet, still have</br>   my ... “ It's just a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">daily</span> thing, I have to check everything. When I get</br>   out and get into the bus, I have to check my wallet. I get out, I check my</br>   wallet and everything. If you drop anything, somebody take it, you're never</br>   going to see that item again.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Sounds like it's a stress that's always—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, yeah. Have to be aware, have to be aware, have to be aware!</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Did you ever feel like that in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: No. Not at all. Never. I used to go to ___ in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">the morning</span>, Chinatown,</br>   by myself. Nothing ever happened. It's just definitely a different world, I</br>   would say.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Different world here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Different people as well. People here is just—I know there's good</br>   people, but it's just, I hate some people really. They super selfish, they</br>   only worry about them. They don't give a damn about anybody else. What can</br>   they do to hurt the other people? For them, it's just them, them, them,</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Why do you think that there's people like that here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> example from the subway, there's a lot of people that they don't</br>   care about the others. I always tell it to my friends when I get to speak</br>   about the city that when I came here, I was giving seats to the ladies, to</br>   the girls. “Hey, take a seat and everything.” The people get crowded at the</br>   door when the subway open the door, they just get crowded. Everybody wants</br>   to get in. I was like, for real, just stepping aside, just trying to let</br>   them go, and then I get in. Now? Nah. They crowd in, I go too. I have to be</br>   like, “I don't give a damn about you.” There are ladies <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">forties</span>, maybe</br>   fifties, they're nice, but I'm not giving my chair. Only if I see a really</br>   elderly lady, “Okay, just take a seat there.” That makes a big change on</br>   you and how you were raised. It's a lot of, the city takes a lot from you:</br>   take your manners, take your... If you're kind to people, get ready,</br>   because this city is going to change you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You feel like it's changed you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah. For real. I feel like it's taking the manners from you. What</br>   else? Kindness. The people ask you for money and everything. They're just</br>   crazy. There's a guy in good working condition, just like, “Hey, give me</br>   some money.” Get out of my face, get the fuck out of my face, because I</br>   can't stand those people. In good, working condition, they can have a job.</br>   I got this in my mind, if you in that condition, a homeless condition, it’s</br>   because you wanted to. You have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> hands, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">two feet</span>, I don't see that you</br>   suffer sickness or something like that, that will not allow you to work or</br>   to have a job. There's a lot of work around here. There's work everywhere.</br>   You just have to want to work <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. That makes me mad a lot. Get out of</br>   here, get out of my face, because I can't stand them. I can't stand the</br>   people. I can’t stand that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What's been the biggest challenge for you? What's been hardest for</br>   you being back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: The biggest challenge I would say is to adapt and to accept people the</br>   way they are because obviously they're not in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. It's hard for me to</br>   accept, to ignore them, to see if someone has stolen something, is not</br>   doing things right. It's hard to me to keep quiet. So, to adapt and to</br>   accept these people. That's really hard. Sometimes I just feel like I want</br>   to scream at people and yell at them. Just, “Get a job, just do something</br>   for your life.” It's like, “Do a job. Everybody's getting a job. Why are</br>   you jacking off? Why are you just jacking people on the streets or trying</br>   to defraud and make fraud everywhere? Just get a job or something.” That</br>   makes me mad, because I have a job. I'm paying taxes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah, you work hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, why you not? For real? I work hard and I pay taxes, so we have a</br>   decent city. You just wake up, go to the bus, and ask for money? That's it?</br>   That makes me mad, for real.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you think that for some people, they're not able to get a job</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: I bet there's some people that are not able to get a job, but there's</br>   a small fraction. Super, super, super small fraction. Let's say, for every</br>   hundred people, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">at least only two</span> of the people there really are disabled,</br>   not able to get a job. The rest, they just don't want to get a job. For</br>   example, those immigrants that came from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Honduras</span>. A couple of them, they</br>   get into the bus, they say, “Just give me money. I don't have any</br>   paperwork.” Dude, you don't need a paperwork. There's a food stand that is</br>   asking for a server or something. You just fill out an application and ask</br>   them for a job. Explain the situation. You say you really need a job, and</br>   you want to work, they're not going to reject you. They're not going to let</br>   you in the streets. And that’s the reason that they're asking for money</br>   like that. Just get out. Get out of here. I'm not going to give you my</br>   money. I'm giving you money to [inaudible 00:31:53] you can have a life,</br>   you can have all type of programs. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I might be a dick</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It's okay. I like honesty. I would rather have an honest answer.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah. That's me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What about, to switch over to a positive note to end on, what's been</br>   the most positive thing for you, or what's been the best part of being back</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Hmm. Getting to know more about my culture. That's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> thing. I've</br>   been reading a lot of books about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Not the culture right now, but</br>   the culture of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Visiting the temples, to</br>   Teotihuacan, have you been there? Those are not, they're pyramids, but it's</br>   called temples. The temples, there's a lot of things. For example, there's</br>   a lot of history on my little village that used to be home of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Aztecs</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: The what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Aztecs</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Oh okay, yes. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Cuauhtemoc</span>, a big icon about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Aztec</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Cuauhtemoc</span>, they used to live</br>   there. There's a lot of finds that have been happening around the village.</br>   Whenever I go, when I have a chance, I go up there, and just explore the</br>   caves. I've been finding paintings, prehistoric paintings. There's a lot of</br>   culture that I've been seeing that I like. That's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> thing, that I'm</br>   getting to know more of my country. Well, my family. I get to see my family</br>   more often. If I stay in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, I will never come, like, “Ah, it's</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: When you lived in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, were you ever able to visit <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: No. Not at all, due to my immigration status. It's like everything.</br>   The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.A.</span> just swallow you into the system. And it's fine. It's working.</br>   The thing that you not able to leave the country, you get used to it, like,</br>   “Oh, it's just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.” I was just playing. To be honest, I would never</br>   come back. I would never come back if I wouldn't have deported, so that's</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> positive thing about the deportation. I got to know my country, my</br>   culture. Got to spend more time with my family. If it wouldn’t have been</br>   like that, I would never have come to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Yeah, I think all the people</br>   that leave <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and emigrate to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, we do the same thing. “Okay, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next   year</span>, I'm going to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.” <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">The year</span> goes by, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the year</span> go by.</br>   “Okay, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span>, I'm going to try to save my money and I'm going to</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.” <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">The two years</span> go by, and it just goes by, goes by, it goes by, it</br>   goes by. It's just like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It would be very difficult, because you would have to—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Cross the border again. Well, you know that things are getting more</br>   hard on the border. There's a lot of chances that you might not make it.</br>   Obviously, the cartels, they took over the border already. Either you pay a</br>   lot of money or you're a mule or they just not let you in. They'll kill</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What are your hopes for your future now back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: It's to get a better job. I know call centers, they pay pretty well,</br>   more than on the street or working in construction, but my plan right now</br>   is to get on track in my studies, get my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">GED</span>, get to university, get some</br>   career. Well, to get a career as quick as possible because I'm not speaking</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about ten years from now</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five years from now</span>, I'm speaking—well maybe</br>   five years. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Ten years</span> is too much. I'm trying to hurry up as quick as</br>   possible and get a job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you want to be a chef again, or something else?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah. It's going to be something else, but food has always been my</br>   passion. I'm planning to get my diploma on PMP. You know what PMP is?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What's that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: It's like a programming managing, it's computers, technology. After</br>   that, I'm planning to open my own restaurant. Start from the bottom,</br>   obviously, and open a small restaurant to see how it goes from there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What kind of restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span> food?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> of my plans is to go to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> because I have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten years</span></br>   deportation, so after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten years</span> I'll see what I can do to that. Hopefully</br>   by then I'll have my restaurant at full potential and to get some chains to</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>, maybe <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">South America</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span> is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of my targets as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: To live?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: To live as well, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>. Well for business as well. Have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> and</br>   Canada for business.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Opening up restaurants?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Opening restaurant. Small restaurants, to make a chain—not so</br>   expensive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: What kind of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span> food do you like to cook?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Well, I just go from stir fry into fried, like tempura things, sushi</br>   rolls. There's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">a million</span> sushi rolls that I can make. Mostly typical more</br>   homemade <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span> food—let's say like ramens, house ramens, and everything.</br>   Some products from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Japan</span>, like specifically like a, how I say? Those</br>   products that you can't get anywhere except <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Japan</span>, so I'm trying to do that</br>   as well. That's one of my priorities as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Why Japan?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Because I like their culture. I've been raised with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span> people as</br>   well, and well I specialize. Out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the ten years</span> of the kitchen, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven   years</span> they were only for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span> food. I know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Italian</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chinese</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Korean</span>,</br>   but <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span> is the one that captured my attention. All the rolls and</br>   everything, the flavors. I know here, their palette, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people,</br>   their taste, they are not really like aware of flavors. I'm working on it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: You can teach them how to like it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Noe</span>: Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> example, when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got into my village, I make a shrimp</br>   fried rice with fruit spring rolls. They only ate the spring rolls. They</br>   didn't like the fried rice with the shrimp. They’re like, “This is the best</br>   thing that you gave me?” There is a big pot, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">maybe three pounds</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">three   </span>pounds of rice. It was decent. “No, I don't like the rice, because it's</br>   just rice.” “Eat it with the chopsticks, I don't think you guys can use it,</br>   so use a fork.” They're like, “No, I don't want to eat just rice.” “Why?”</br>   “Because I'm not a chicken.” I'm like, “Just eat it.” And now they're</br>   saying, “Oh it just tastes like garlic.” “That's what fried rice tastes</br>   like! Okay, fuck it! Just leave it, I'll just eat it all by myself.” Yeah,</br>   they didn't like it. Some of my friends, they like it, but my family, my</br>   parents, they're like super <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. [Chuckles]. They don't really used to</br>   a different type. They give you beans, tortillas, and pork meat, and beef</br>   meat. They're happy with it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Well, hopefully one day, if you have a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexican childhood, Mexican childhood, Memories">Lizzy: Do you have a favorite memory or a least favorite memory of your   childhood?     Noe: I was born in a city called Tasco. Actually, my parents, they're from   a small village around thirty minutes from the city. The village is really   small. As I remember, we used to have dirt houses, small dirt houses. What   else? We didn't have any… Like the roads, it's like dust and ground, like   raw ground roads. What else? I remember that the people, they used to were   more kind. it was just love everywhere in my childhood. I used to be   shepherd, I used to have a sheep. I used to go to the mountains with my   sheeps, trying to feed them and everything. I used to have one small cow. I   used to have two horses and everything. After I immigrate to the US with   none English, I went there, live with my brother first, and I started went   to school, and started looking for a job actually. I was underage, so my   parents have to sign off the sheet for me to get a job.    </span> Lizzy: And you were fifteen at that time, right?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was fifteen. Yeah, you're not sixteen, I think, you cannot work over</br>   there. I was just having a little, small part-time. After that I went to</br>   ___ High School. I went there and after I moved to ____, which is, I got my</br>   GED from there. Well, it was just fine. I was growing up, making friends</br>   and everything. I got used to the city. I got used to, how can I say?</br>   Literally, the U.S., it swallowed me right away. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It swallowed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, it swallowed me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well, to get me into, how you say, the living style over there. I</br>   adapted very well. I graduate, I start moving by myself. I move into my own</br>   apartment. My own connections. After that, I became a chef. It was a little</br>   bit of an expert on the kitchen. I got an offer, a job offer, from Iowa</br>   about a restaurant opening. They offered me a pretty good salary, and I</br>   didn't have to pay rent, so I didn't think twice about moving out there. I</br>   opened the restaurant. They were really happy with my work. They were doing</br>   very well. I set up everything right.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well after six months, I decided to return to California because I</br>   thought I was missing the weather because it's really cold over there in</br>   Iowa. Well, after I saw the living expenses in California and living</br>   expenses in Iowa, I make my statement. I was like, “No, I'm not staying in</br>   California anymore.” Then I decided to move for good to Iowa. I went to</br>   WITCC [Western Iowa Tech Community College]. I was trying to go for a</br>   dentist.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That was the community college that you went to?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, the community college. It was one year and a half only, but it</br>   was only in generals before I decided what to do. I was undecided between</br>   being a dentist or a medical assistant. I was just going to generals before</br>   I decide, and I was making my own investigation about salaries—first</br>   priority was money, then timing, and then work bills and everything around</br>   the community. Luckily, I didn't get to really get into the college about</br>   my major. Well, after I return, I came to my small village—</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Let's back up just a little bit to what led to you getting deported.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was just having a good time with a friend. I was not the driver.</br>   First, we got detained for swinging lines.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Swinging lines, like roughly driving, like reckless driving. Well, we</br>   were kind of a little bit of drinking. They were like, “Okay, drinking and</br>   driving.” I was like, “Oh well.” I thought I was not going to get arrested,</br>   but the people decide to arrest me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You weren't the driver?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I wasn't the driver, no.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Your friend was arrested for reckless driving, and what was your</br>   charge?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: We charged for… Because that guy had an open container. It wasn't a</br>   beer, but it was just a small glass from the bar that he took. They decided</br>   to charge us both with open container. When I got into—well they just</br>   detained me. Well, they scanned me literally, they run all my information,</br>   they didn't find any social security number. That's how they called ICE.</br>   ICE literally detained me for about a month before I decided to sign on my</br>   deportation because I was sick of the jail. I was just tired and</br>   everything. I speak to the judge once, “Okay, we'll see you for the next</br>   court.” I was like, “No.” I was so sick already because I spent in County</br>   for about four months as I remember, and then one more month with ICE. I</br>   was just sick of it. I was like, “No, I just want to go.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You decided you would rather leave and be deported back to Mexico</br>   than stay in detention longer?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Uh-huh. I was like, ”No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What were the conditions like in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Detention, it's just disgusting. It's just disgusting. There's hair</br>   everywhere. Everything is dirty. It smells. The beds are hard. They give</br>   you like, a little mattress like this, and it's just plastic. No, it's</br>   undescribable. If you've never been there, it's undescribable. You can't</br>   sleep because you always have to be aware. You never know who's going to</br>   come through that door or who's going to be sleeping with you on the next</br>   bunker. Yeah, it's rough. And you get sick there. I was just sick of it. I</br>   was like, give me my deportation. I just want to go.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How did they treat you there?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Not bad, but they always intimidating, like trying to ... It's like</br>   you are in jail, I guess. They don't want anyone to feel that they can make</br>   whatever they want with them, or trying to intimidate the [inaudible], or</br>   any other type of misconduct, I would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, misconduct.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, it's just hard. It’s undescribable.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What was the food like?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's just gross. The portions are none literally. Sometimes they give</br>   you rotten milk—just little boxes, like little milk boxes, like a little</br>   carton thing. Yeah, so sometimes there's hair in the food. Sometimes it's</br>   just the portions, literally, they just like shoved in like a half of a</br>   spoon, just throw it in there. What else besides the hair..?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You were hungry a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah there was a lot of hunger in there. You can't save food either.</br>   Cause I remember we used to save the peanut butter sandwich to keep it for</br>   later on, for late night, so we wouldn't get hungry. They would search you</br>   so if they found you everything that's ... They will penalize you, either</br>   with the hole and everything, or twenty-four hours locked in. It's kind of</br>   hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Big punishment just for trying to save food for later?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. Well... [Chuckles]. You're in there, you can't do anything.</br>   You're just one more number and one more inmate.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Were any of your family members or friends able to come visit you</br>   while you were in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. I was just by myself. My only family, they all stay in California,</br>   and I was by myself in ____, Iowa. I didn't really want to call them,</br>   because they say [inaudible] They were never going to support me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They wouldn't support you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Can you tell me more about that? They wouldn't support you in terms</br>   of that they would be upset with you, or just that they wouldn't help you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I think they would help me, but they would be disappointed of me.</br>   They'd say, “Why you do this?” or something like that. I rather not to call</br>   them or tell them about...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't know that you were detained?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, they didn't know.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When did they find out?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: When I got deported. [Chuckles]. When I got deported, I got released</br>   on… What's it called? Nuevo Laredo, it's like the Texas border. I got</br>   released over there, and then I called my brother because he owes me money.</br>   I called him just to tell him I'm here in Nuevo Laredo. Send me some money</br>   because I got to come home. [Chuckles]. Well, yeah, that's how they found</br>   out I got deported. I'm pretty sure they would’ve helped me; they gave me</br>   some money. But after that, no. That's when I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you remember what it was like that day crossing the bridge from</br>   Texas back into Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. I will never forget that. They just gave you this small bag with</br>   your belongs, [Chuckles] which is like clothes from jail, so they're not</br>   really good. They give you small needs, like a bag with needs, with</br>   everything. They just release you. They take all the chains off. They're</br>   just like, “Get off the bus, walk across the bridge.” That's it. Well, you</br>   had to cross it. [Chuckle]. What other choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did you do when you were across the bridge?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was a little scared, a little excited about a new thing, but I was</br>   just thinking too much—like I don't have money, where am I going to go?</br>   What I going to do? There was a lot of rumors about the cartels recruiting</br>   immigrants as soon as you cross the bridge; they going to make you get into</br>   a car, and they going to take you from there. If you with them or not, they</br>   going to kill you. I was just looking around like, “Where's the car?</br>   Where's the car?” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you have any experience like that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, not really. Luckily, I got welcomed by this group of people—the</br>   one I mentioned. They literally just went, “Okay, where are you going?” I'm</br>   like, “Oh, I'm going to Guerrero.” “Okay, so listen. We are from the</br>   Mexican government. We here to assist you and help with everything that you</br>   might need.” I was like, “Okay.” “Just come with us.” it was a little scary</br>   because they say, “Okay, just come with us,” and they just take you around</br>   the building. You don't even know, what other choice do you have? You</br>   either stay with them or just stay in the street?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And you're not sure whether it's safe to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: No other choice?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They say they from the government and they have a little logo, a</br>   Mexico logo, so I was like, “Okay. I'm going to just go with them. Whatever</br>   happens is going to happen.” They give you access to computers to</br>   communicate with your family and everything. That's when I got in contact</br>   with my brother. I was just like, “Send me some money here. I'm going to</br>   need for my bus ride at least.” Then one of the guys heard me: “Hey, where</br>   did you say you were from?” I'm like, “I'm from Guerrero.” “Oh, Guerrero, I</br>   think Guerrero have some programs about immigrants from their state. It’s</br>   their people, and they take care of them.” Yeah, if you're an immigrant</br>   from my state like Guerrero, and you were born there, they will pay you. If</br>   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,</br>   and not even five minutes, they will be answering you with the</br>   approve—well, the bus will have to take you to Guerrero.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To take you to Guerrero?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It was nice, I was like, “Okay.” I just told my brother to send me</br>   money to Guerrero. I get to my house. That was it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did that feel like being back in your home?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: [Exhale]. It was just awful. As I say, nobody knew me. I didn't know</br>   nobody besides my family, my close friends and family, close family.</br>   Besides my neighbors, they didn't know who I was. I didn't know who they</br>   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids</br>   five years old, they were almost twenty-five by then. I was like, “No.” It</br>   was exciting getting to know more people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you feel like you were returning home, or did you feel like an</br>   outsider?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I felt like an outsider. Yeah, definitely an outsider. Well,</br>   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.</br>   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you</br>   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or</br>   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just</br>   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I</br>   was like, “No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How long did you stay there before you came to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About one year. I've been living one year here. I've been jumping job</br>   by job. Some jobs did not accept me because I don’t have the high school</br>   diploma—that's why I'm trying to get it. Luckily, T-Tech they accept you.</br>   They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As</br>   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you like working at T-Tech?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I've only been working there for two weeks, but I think I'm going to</br>   like a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What do you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to</br>   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high</br>   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There’s no…</br>   a lot of people speak English better than me, like, “Go eff yourself.”</br> </br> </br>   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs</br>   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't</br>   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the</br>   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for three months. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is</br>   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,</br>   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for</br>   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of</br>   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I</br>   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the</br>   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.</br>   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went</br>   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the</br>   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying</br>   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to</br>   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you</br>   guys thinking about?”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like you had a different work ethic than your coworkers</br>   there. Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the U.S.</br>   culture, I guess? In the U.S., you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and</br>   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I</br>   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really</br>   ask for rewards and everything. I remember one time, a lady—a messy girl</br>   from the streets, I think she was homeless—she showed up at the restaurant,</br>   and was like, “Hey, is this yours?” It was my wallet. I was like, “Yeah.</br>   Where you found it?” “Here. There's a lot of money in there, so take care</br>   of it.” I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was</br>   like, “Hey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you</br>   want.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: She was like, “Oh no no, I got to go. I got to go.” I was like, “You</br>   sure? Come on, let me cook something for you. You can have it for later.</br>   You can have it for to go. “No no, no, thank you, thank you, thank you.”</br>   She just left. I was like, “Wow.” And here, I already lost my wallet once.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Nobody returned it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I ain't got no call. I got nothing. I got nothing for it. That's what</br>   I hate about this.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had mentioned in the survey you got attacked and your belongings</br>   stolen. Can you tell me about that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Oh yeah. I was hanging out with my friend. She's a girl, short girl,</br>   and I didn't really know. Those guys, they came to us with the knives. They</br>   pull out the knives. They came to me, they put a knife on my neck, and</br>   another one in my stomach, like say, “Don't move, don't move.” But as they</br>   say that, I didn't show that I was afraid of them. I was just like, “Okay,</br>   calm down. Take whatever you want. Don't do anything stupid, something like</br>   that.” I didn't want to do anything—hit back or something and run</br>   away—because I was with the girl. I was just more scared about her. She was</br>   super scared. I was like, “Just take that, just go.” Yeah, after that,</br>   there was a police station two blocks from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you go to the police?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, we went to the police. She filed a report and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did they do? Nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Nothing. Nothing at all. I don't think she got contacted or something,</br>   and I don't think they did something. It's just like a regular thing around</br>   here. You get jacked and they steal your stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had said that you don't feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. To be honest, I don't feel safe. I'm always on guard, like</br>   everything. When I see people, as long as I’m by myself, and I see people</br>   getting close to me, I'm going to get just on guard. I see something you're</br>   trying to do to me, I'm just going to scream and run. [Chuckle]. I don't</br>   feel safe. I’m always aware. When I'm on the subway, on the streets, I'm</br>   always checking my pockets around, “Oh, I still have my wallet, still have</br>   my ... “ It's just a daily thing, I have to check everything. When I get</br>   out and get into the bus, I have to check my wallet. I get out, I check my</br>   wallet and everything. If you drop anything, somebody take it, you're never</br>   going to see that item again.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like it's a stress that's always—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, yeah. Have to be aware, have to be aware, have to be aware!</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you ever feel like that in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all. Never. I used to go to ___ in the morning, Chinatown,</br>   by myself. Nothing ever happened. It's just definitely a different world, I</br>   would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Different world here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Different people as well. People here is just—I know there's good</br>   people, but it's just, I hate some people really. They super selfish, they</br>   only worry about them. They don't give a damn about anybody else. What can</br>   they do to hurt the other people? For them, it's just them, them, them,</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think that there's people like that here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: One example from the subway, there's a lot of people that they don't</br>   care about the others. I always tell it to my friends when I get to speak</br>   about the city that when I came here, I was giving seats to the ladies, to</br>   the girls. “Hey, take a seat and everything.” The people get crowded at the</br>   door when the subway open the door, they just get crowded. Everybody wants</br>   to get in. I was like, for real, just stepping aside, just trying to let</br>   them go, and then I get in. Now? Nah. They crowd in, I go too. I have to be</br>   like, “I don't give a damn about you.” There are ladies forties, maybe</br>   fifties, they're nice, but I'm not giving my chair. Only if I see a really</br>   elderly lady, “Okay, just take a seat there.” That makes a big change on</br>   you and how you were raised. It's a lot of, the city takes a lot from you:</br>   take your manners, take your... If you're kind to people, get ready,</br>   because this city is going to change you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You feel like it's changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. For real. I feel like it's taking the manners from you. What</br>   else? Kindness. The people ask you for money and everything. They're just</br>   crazy. There's a guy in good working condition, just like, “Hey, give me</br>   some money.” Get out of my face, get the fuck out of my face, because I</br>   can't stand those people. In good, working condition, they can have a job.</br>   I got this in my mind, if you in that condition, a homeless condition, it’s</br>   because you wanted to. You have two hands, two feet, I don't see that you</br>   suffer sickness or something like that, that will not allow you to work or</br>   to have a job. There's a lot of work around here. There's work everywhere.</br>   You just have to want to work first. That makes me mad a lot. Get out of</br>   here, get out of my face, because I can't stand them. I can't stand the</br>   people. I can’t stand that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's been the biggest challenge for you? What's been hardest for</br>   you being back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: The biggest challenge I would say is to adapt and to accept people the</br>   way they are because obviously they're not in the US. It's hard for me to</br>   accept, to ignore them, to see if someone has stolen something, is not</br>   doing things right. It's hard to me to keep quiet. So, to adapt and to</br>   accept these people. That's really hard. Sometimes I just feel like I want</br>   to scream at people and yell at them. Just, “Get a job, just do something</br>   for your life.” It's like, “Do a job. Everybody's getting a job. Why are</br>   you jacking off? Why are you just jacking people on the streets or trying</br>   to defraud and make fraud everywhere? Just get a job or something.” That</br>   makes me mad, because I have a job. I'm paying taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, you work hard.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, why you not? For real? I work hard and I pay taxes, so we have a</br>   decent city. You just wake up, go to the bus, and ask for money? That's it?</br>   That makes me mad, for real.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you think that for some people, they're not able to get a job</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I bet there's some people that are not able to get a job, but there's</br>   a small fraction. Super, super, super small fraction. Let's say, for every</br>   hundred people, at least only two of the people there really are disabled,</br>   not able to get a job. The rest, they just don't want to get a job. For</br>   example, those immigrants that came from Honduras. A couple of them, they</br>   get into the bus, they say, “Just give me money. I don't have any</br>   paperwork.” Dude, you don't need a paperwork. There's a food stand that is</br>   asking for a server or something. You just fill out an application and ask</br>   them for a job. Explain the situation. You say you really need a job, and</br>   you want to work, they're not going to reject you. They're not going to let</br>   you in the streets. And that’s the reason that they're asking for money</br>   like that. Just get out. Get out of here. I'm not going to give you my</br>   money. I'm giving you money to [inaudible 00:31:53] you can have a life,</br>   you can have all type of programs. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I might be a dick</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's okay. I like honesty. I would rather have an honest answer.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. That's me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What about, to switch over to a positive note to end on, what's been</br>   the most positive thing for you, or what's been the best part of being back</br>   in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Hmm. Getting to know more about my culture. That's one thing. I've</br>   been reading a lot of books about Mexico. Not the culture right now, but</br>   the culture of Mexico, Hispanic Mexico. Visiting the temples, to</br>   Teotihuacan, have you been there? Those are not, they're pyramids, but it's</br>   called temples. The temples, there's a lot of things. For example, there's</br>   a lot of history on my little village that used to be home of the Aztecs.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: The what?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Aztecs.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Oh okay, yes. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Cuauhtemoc, a big icon about the Aztec. Cuauhtemoc, they used to live</br>   there. There's a lot of finds that have been happening around the village.</br>   Whenever I go, when I have a chance, I go up there, and just explore the</br>   caves. I've been finding paintings, prehistoric paintings. There's a lot of</br>   culture that I've been seeing that I like. That's one thing, that I'm</br>   getting to know more of my country. Well, my family. I get to see my family</br>   more often. If I stay in the US, I will never come, like, “Ah, it's</br>   Mexico.” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When you lived in the US, were you ever able to visit Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all, due to my immigration status. It's like everything.</br>   The U.S.A. just swallow you into the system. And it's fine. It's working.</br>   The thing that you not able to leave the country, you get used to it, like,</br>   “Oh, it's just Mexico.” I was just playing. To be honest, I would never</br>   come back. I would never come back if I wouldn't have deported, so that's</br>   one positive thing about the deportation. I got to know my country, my</br>   culture. Got to spend more time with my family. If it wouldn’t have been</br>   like that, I would never have come to Mexico. Yeah, I think all the people</br>   that leave Mexico and emigrate to the US, we do the same thing. “Okay, next</br>   year, I'm going to go to Mexico.” The year goes by, and the year go by.</br>   “Okay, in two years, I'm going to try to save my money and I'm going to</br>   Mexico.” The two years go by, and it just goes by, goes by, it goes by, it</br>   goes by. It's just like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It would be very difficult, because you would have to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Cross the border again. Well, you know that things are getting more</br>   hard on the border. There's a lot of chances that you might not make it.</br>   Obviously, the cartels, they took over the border already. Either you pay a</br>   lot of money or you're a mule or they just not let you in. They'll kill</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What are your hopes for your future now back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's to get a better job. I know call centers, they pay pretty well,</br>   more than on the street or working in construction, but my plan right now</br>   is to get on track in my studies, get my GED, get to university, get some</br>   career. Well, to get a career as quick as possible because I'm not speaking</br>   about ten years from now or five years from now, I'm speaking—well maybe</br>   five years. Ten years is too much. I'm trying to hurry up as quick as</br>   possible and get a job.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you want to be a chef again, or something else?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. It's going to be something else, but food has always been my</br>   passion. I'm planning to get my diploma on PMP. You know what PMP is?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's like a programming managing, it's computers, technology. After</br>   that, I'm planning to open my own restaurant. Start from the bottom,</br>   obviously, and open a small restaurant to see how it goes from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Japanese.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Japanese food?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. One of my plans is to go to the US because I have ten years</br>   deportation, so after ten years I'll see what I can do to that. Hopefully</br>   by then I'll have my restaurant at full potential and to get some chains to</br>   the U.S., maybe South America. Canada is one of my targets as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To live?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: To live as well, Canada. Well for business as well. Have U.S. and</br>   Canada for business.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Opening up restaurants?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Opening restaurant. Small restaurants, to make a chain—not so</br>   expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of Japanese food do you like to cook?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well, I just go from stir fry into fried, like tempura things, sushi</br>   rolls. There's a million sushi rolls that I can make. Mostly typical more</br>   homemade Japanese food—let's say like ramens, house ramens, and everything.</br>   Some products from Japan, like specifically like a, how I say? Those</br>   products that you can't get anywhere except Japan, so I'm trying to do that</br>   as well. That's one of my priorities as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why Japan?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Because I like their culture. I've been raised with Japanese people as</br>   well, and well I specialize. Out of the ten years of the kitchen, seven</br>   years they were only for Japanese food. I know Italian, Chinese, Korean,</br>   but Japanese is the one that captured my attention. All the rolls and</br>   everything, the flavors. I know here, their palette, the Mexican people,</br>   their taste, they are not really like aware of flavors. I'm working on it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You can teach them how to like it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Noe: Yeah, one example, when I first got into my village, I make a shrimp   fried rice with fruit spring rolls. They only ate the spring rolls. They   didn't like the fried rice with the shrimp. They’re like, “This is the best   thing that you gave me?” There is a big pot, maybe three pounds, three   pounds of rice. It was decent. “No, I don't like the rice, because it's   just rice.” “Eat it with the chopsticks, I don't think you guys can use it,   so use a fork.” They're like, “No, I don't want to eat just rice.” “Why?”   “Because I'm not a chicken.” I'm like, “Just eat it.” And now they're   saying, “Oh it just tastes like garlic.” “That's what fried rice tastes   like! Okay, fuck it! Just leave it, I'll just eat it all by myself.” Yeah,   they didn't like it. Some of my friends, they like it, but my family, my   parents, they're like super Mexican. [Chuckles]. They don't really used to   a different type. They give you beans, tortillas, and pork meat, and beef   meat. They're happy with it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Noe: Because I like their culture.

It's just disgusting. There's hair   everywhere. Everything is dirty. It smells. The beds are hard. They give   you like, a little mattress like this, and it's just plastic. No, it's   undescribable. If you've never been there, it's undescribable. You can't   sleep because you always have to be aware. You never know who's going to   come through that door or who's going to be sleeping with you on the next   bunker. Yeah, it's rough. And you get sick there. I was just sick of it. I   was like, give me my deportation. I just want to go.    </span> Lizzy: How did they treat you there?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Not bad, but they always intimidating, like trying to ... It's like</br>   you are in jail, I guess. They don't want anyone to feel that they can make</br>   whatever they want with them, or trying to intimidate the [inaudible], or</br>   any other type of misconduct, I would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, misconduct.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, it's just hard. It’s undescribable.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What was the food like?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's just gross. The portions are none literally. Sometimes they give</br>   you rotten milk—just little boxes, like little milk boxes, like a little</br>   carton thing. Yeah, so sometimes there's hair in the food. Sometimes it's</br>   just the portions, literally, they just like shoved in like a half of a</br>   spoon, just throw it in there. What else besides the hair..?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You were hungry a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah there was a lot of hunger in there. You can't save food either.</br>   Cause I remember we used to save the peanut butter sandwich to keep it for</br>   later on, for late night, so we wouldn't get hungry. They would search you</br>   so if they found you everything that's ... They will penalize you, either</br>   with the hole and everything, or twenty-four hours locked in. It's kind of</br>   hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Big punishment just for trying to save food for later?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. Well... [Chuckles]. You're in there, you can't do anything.</br>   You're just one more number and one more inmate.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Were any of your family members or friends able to come visit you</br>   while you were in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. I was just by myself.

[Chuckles]. When I got deported, I got released</br>   on… What's it called? Nuevo Laredo, it's like the Texas border. I got</br>   released over there, and then I called my brother because he owes me money.</br>   I called him just to tell him I'm here in Nuevo Laredo. Send me some money</br>   because I got to come home. [Chuckles]. Well, yeah, that's how they found</br>   out I got deported. I'm pretty sure they would’ve helped me; they gave me</br>   some money. But after that, no. That's when I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you remember what it was like that day crossing the bridge from</br>   Texas back into Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. I will never forget that. They just gave you this small bag with</br>   your belongs, [Chuckles] which is like clothes from jail, so they're not</br>   really good. They give you small needs, like a bag with needs, with</br>   everything. They just release you. They take all the chains off. They're</br>   just like, “Get off the bus, walk across the bridge.” That's it. Well, you</br>   had to cross it. [Chuckle]. What other choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did you do when you were across the bridge?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was a little scared, a little excited about a new thing, but I was</br>   just thinking too much—like I don't have money, where am I going to go?</br>   What I going to do? There was a lot of rumors about the cartels recruiting</br>   immigrants as soon as you cross the bridge; they going to make you get into</br>   a car, and they going to take you from there. If you with them or not, they</br>   going to kill you. I was just looking around like, “Where's the car?</br>   Where's the car?” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you have any experience like that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, not really. Luckily, I got welcomed by this group of people—the</br>   one I mentioned. They literally just went, “Okay, where are you going?” I'm</br>   like, “Oh, I'm going to Guerrero.” “Okay, so listen. We are from the</br>   Mexican government. We here to assist you and help with everything that you</br>   might need.” I was like, “Okay.” “Just come with us.” it was a little scary</br>   because they say, “Okay, just come with us,” and they just take you around</br>   the building. You don't even know, what other choice do you have? You</br>   either stay with them or just stay in the street?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And you're not sure whether it's safe to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: No other choice?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They say they from the government and they have a little logo, a</br>   Mexico logo, so I was like, “Okay. I'm going to just go with them. Whatever</br>   happens is going to happen.” They give you access to computers to</br>   communicate with your family and everything. That's when I got in contact</br>   with my brother. I was just like, “Send me some money here. I'm going to</br>   need for my bus ride at least.” Then one of the guys heard me: “Hey, where</br>   did you say you were from?” I'm like, “I'm from Guerrero.” “Oh, Guerrero, I</br>   think Guerrero have some programs about immigrants from their state. It’s</br>   their people, and they take care of them.” Yeah, if you're an immigrant</br>   from my state like Guerrero, and you were born there, they will pay you. If</br>   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,</br>   and not even five minutes, they will be answering you with the</br>   approve—well, the bus will have to take you to Guerrero.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To take you to Guerrero?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It was nice, I was like, “Okay.” I just told my brother to send me</br>   money to Guerrero. I get to my house. That was it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did that feel like being back in your home?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: [Exhale]. It was just awful. As I say, nobody knew me. I didn't know</br>   nobody besides my family, my close friends and family, close family.</br>   Besides my neighbors, they didn't know who I was. I didn't know who they</br>   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids</br>   five years old, they were almost twenty-five by then. I was like, “No.” It</br>   was exciting getting to know more people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you feel like you were returning home, or did you feel like an</br>   outsider?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I felt like an outsider. Yeah, definitely an outsider. Well,</br>   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.</br>   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you</br>   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or</br>   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just</br>   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I</br>   was like, “No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How long did you stay there before you came to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About one year. I've been living one year here. I've been jumping job</br>   by job. Some jobs did not accept me because I don’t have the high school</br>   diploma—that's why I'm trying to get it. Luckily, T-Tech they accept you.</br>   They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As</br>   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you like working at T-Tech?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I've only been working there for two weeks, but I think I'm going to</br>   like a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What do you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to</br>   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high</br>   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There’s no…</br>   a lot of people speak English better than me, like, “Go eff yourself.”</br> </br> </br>   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs</br>   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't</br>   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the</br>   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for three months. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is</br>   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,</br>   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for</br>   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of</br>   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I</br>   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the</br>   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.</br>   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went</br>   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the</br>   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying</br>   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to</br>   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you</br>   guys thinking about?”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like you had a different work ethic than your coworkers</br>   there. Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the U.S.</br>   culture, I guess? In the U.S., you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and</br>   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I</br>   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really</br>   ask for rewards and everything. I remember one time, a lady—a messy girl</br>   from the streets, I think she was homeless—she showed up at the restaurant,</br>   and was like, “Hey, is this yours?” It was my wallet. I was like, “Yeah.</br>   Where you found it?” “Here. There's a lot of money in there, so take care</br>   of it.” I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was</br>   like, “Hey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you</br>   want.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: She was like, “Oh no no, I got to go. I got to go.” I was like, “You</br>   sure? Come on, let me cook something for you. You can have it for later.</br>   You can have it for to go. “No no, no, thank you, thank you, thank you.”</br>   She just left. I was like, “Wow.” And here, I already lost my wallet once.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Nobody returned it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I ain't got no call. I got nothing. I got nothing for it. That's what</br>   I hate about this.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had mentioned in the survey you got attacked and your belongings</br>   stolen. Can you tell me about that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Oh yeah. I was hanging out with my friend. She's a girl, short girl,</br>   and I didn't really know. Those guys, they came to us with the knives. They</br>   pull out the knives. They came to me, they put a knife on my neck, and</br>   another one in my stomach, like say, “Don't move, don't move.” But as they</br>   say that, I didn't show that I was afraid of them. I was just like, “Okay,</br>   calm down. Take whatever you want. Don't do anything stupid, something like</br>   that.” I didn't want to do anything—hit back or something and run</br>   away—because I was with the girl. I was just more scared about her. She was</br>   super scared. I was like, “Just take that, just go.” Yeah, after that,</br>   there was a police station two blocks from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you go to the police?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, we went to the police. She filed a report and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did they do? Nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Nothing. Nothing at all. I don't think she got contacted or something,</br>   and I don't think they did something. It's just like a regular thing around</br>   here. You get jacked and they steal your stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had said that you don't feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. To be honest, I don't feel safe. I'm always on guard, like</br>   everything. When I see people, as long as I’m by myself, and I see people</br>   getting close to me, I'm going to get just on guard. I see something you're</br>   trying to do to me, I'm just going to scream and run. [Chuckle]. I don't</br>   feel safe. I’m always aware. When I'm on the subway, on the streets, I'm</br>   always checking my pockets around, “Oh, I still have my wallet, still have</br>   my ... “ It's just a daily thing, I have to check everything. When I get</br>   out and get into the bus, I have to check my wallet. I get out, I check my</br>   wallet and everything. If you drop anything, somebody take it, you're never</br>   going to see that item again.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like it's a stress that's always—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, yeah. Have to be aware, have to be aware, have to be aware!</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you ever feel like that in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all. Never. I used to go to ___ in the morning, Chinatown,</br>   by myself. Nothing ever happened. It's just definitely a different world, I</br>   would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Different world here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Different people as well. People here is just—I know there's good</br>   people, but it's just, I hate some people really. They super selfish, they</br>   only worry about them. They don't give a damn about anybody else. What can</br>   they do to hurt the other people? For them, it's just them, them, them,</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think that there's people like that here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: One example from the subway, there's a lot of people that they don't</br>   care about the others. I always tell it to my friends when I get to speak</br>   about the city that when I came here, I was giving seats to the ladies, to</br>   the girls. “Hey, take a seat and everything.” The people get crowded at the</br>   door when the subway open the door, they just get crowded. Everybody wants</br>   to get in. I was like, for real, just stepping aside, just trying to let</br>   them go, and then I get in. Now? Nah. They crowd in, I go too. I have to be</br>   like, “I don't give a damn about you.” There are ladies forties, maybe</br>   fifties, they're nice, but I'm not giving my chair. Only if I see a really</br>   elderly lady, “Okay, just take a seat there.” That makes a big change on</br>   you and how you were raised. It's a lot of, the city takes a lot from you:</br>   take your manners, take your... If you're kind to people, get ready,</br>   because this city is going to change you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You feel like it's changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. For real. I feel like it's taking the manners from you. What</br>   else? Kindness. The people ask you for money and everything. They're just</br>   crazy. There's a guy in good working condition, just like, “Hey, give me</br>   some money.” Get out of my face, get the fuck out of my face, because I</br>   can't stand those people. In good, working condition, they can have a job.</br>   I got this in my mind, if you in that condition, a homeless condition, it’s</br>   because you wanted to. You have two hands, two feet, I don't see that you</br>   suffer sickness or something like that, that will not allow you to work or</br>   to have a job. There's a lot of work around here. There's work everywhere.</br>   You just have to want to work first. That makes me mad a lot. Get out of</br>   here, get out of my face, because I can't stand them. I can't stand the</br>   people. I can’t stand that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's been the biggest challenge for you? What's been hardest for</br>   you being back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: The biggest challenge I would say is to adapt and to accept people the</br>   way they are because obviously they're not in the US. It's hard for me to</br>   accept, to ignore them, to see if someone has stolen something, is not</br>   doing things right. It's hard to me to keep quiet. So, to adapt and to</br>   accept these people. That's really hard. Sometimes I just feel like I want</br>   to scream at people and yell at them. Just, “Get a job, just do something</br>   for your life.” It's like, “Do a job. Everybody's getting a job. Why are</br>   you jacking off? Why are you just jacking people on the streets or trying</br>   to defraud and make fraud everywhere? Just get a job or something.” That</br>   makes me mad, because I have a job. I'm paying taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, you work hard.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, why you not? For real? I work hard and I pay taxes, so we have a</br>   decent city. You just wake up, go to the bus, and ask for money? That's it?</br>   That makes me mad, for real.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you think that for some people, they're not able to get a job</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I bet there's some people that are not able to get a job, but there's</br>   a small fraction. Super, super, super small fraction. Let's say, for every</br>   hundred people, at least only two of the people there really are disabled,</br>   not able to get a job. The rest, they just don't want to get a job. For</br>   example, those immigrants that came from Honduras. A couple of them, they</br>   get into the bus, they say, “Just give me money. I don't have any</br>   paperwork.” Dude, you don't need a paperwork. There's a food stand that is</br>   asking for a server or something. You just fill out an application and ask</br>   them for a job. Explain the situation. You say you really need a job, and</br>   you want to work, they're not going to reject you. They're not going to let</br>   you in the streets. And that’s the reason that they're asking for money</br>   like that. Just get out. Get out of here. I'm not going to give you my</br>   money. I'm giving you money to [inaudible 00:31:53] you can have a life,</br>   you can have all type of programs. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I might be a dick</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's okay. I like honesty. I would rather have an honest answer.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. That's me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What about, to switch over to a positive note to end on, what's been</br>   the most positive thing for you, or what's been the best part of being back</br>   in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Best parts aboutbeing back">Noe: Hmm. Getting to know more about my culture. That's one thing. I've   been reading a lot of books about Mexico. Not the culture right now, but   the culture of Mexico, Hispanic Mexico. Visiting the temples, to   Teotihuacan, have you been there? Those are not, they're pyramids, but it's   called temples. The temples, there's a lot of things. For example, there's   a lot of history on my little village that used to be home of the Aztecs.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being, Cultural differences">Noe: I bet there's some people that are not able to get a job, but there's   a small fraction.

They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire   you.    </span> Lizzy: Do you like working at T-Tech?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I've only been working there for two weeks, but I think I'm going to</br>   like a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What do you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to</br>   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high</br>   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There’s no…</br>   a lot of people speak English better than me, like, “Go eff yourself.”</br> </br> </br>   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs</br>   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't</br>   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the</br>   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for three months. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Discrimination/stigmatization">Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you   guys thinking about?”    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Discrimination/stigmatization, Language">Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make   them less or something.

Yeah, definitely an outsider. Well,   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I   was like, “No, I'm not staying here.”    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Policy for reintegration">Noe: [Exhale]. It was just awful. As I say, nobody knew me. I didn't know   nobody besides my family, my close friends and family, close family.   Besides my neighbors, they didn't know who I was. I didn't know who they   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids   five years old, they were almost twenty-five by then. I was like, “No.” It   was exciting getting to know more people.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Policy for reintegration">Noe: They say they from the government and they have a little logo, a   Mexico logo, so I was like, “Okay. I'm going to just go with them. Whatever   happens is going to happen.” They give you access to computers to   communicate with your family and everything. That's when I got in contact   with my brother. I was just like, “Send me some money here. I'm going to   need for my bus ride at least.” Then one of the guys heard me: “Hey, where   did you say you were from?” I'm like, “I'm from Guerrero.” “Oh, Guerrero, I   think Guerrero have some programs about immigrants from their state. It’s   their people, and they take care of them.” Yeah, if you're an immigrant   from my state like Guerrero, and you were born there, they will pay you. If   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,   and not even five minutes, they will be answering you with the   approve—well, the bus will have to take you to Guerrero.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Policy for reintegration">Noe: No, not really. Luckily, I got welcomed by this group of people—the   one I mentioned. They literally just went, “Okay, where are you going?” I'm   like, “Oh, I'm going to Guerrero.” “Okay, so listen. We are from the   Mexican government. We here to assist you and help with everything that you   might need.” I was like, “Okay.” “Just come with us.” it was a little scary   because they say, “Okay, just come with us,” and they just take you around   the building. You don't even know, what other choice do you have? You   either stay with them or just stay in the street?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being">Noe: I was a little scared, a little excited about a new thing, but I was   just thinking too much—like I don't have money, where am I going to go?   What I going to do? There was a lot of rumors about the cartels recruiting   immigrants as soon as you cross the bridge; they going to make you get into   a car, and they going to take you from there. If you with them or not, they   going to kill you. I was just looking around like, “Where's the car?   Where's the car?” [Chuckles].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Reasons, Deportation">Noe: Yeah. I will never forget that. They just gave you this small bag with   your belongs, [Chuckles] which is like clothes from jail, so they're not   really good. They give you small needs, like a bag with needs, with   everything. They just release you. They take all the chains off. They're   just like, “Get off the bus, walk across the bridge.” That's it. Well, you   had to cross it. [Chuckle]. What other choice do you have?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Reasons, Deportation">Noe: When I got deported. [Chuckles]. When I got deported, I got released   on… What's it called? Nuevo Laredo, it's like the Texas border. I got   released over there, and then I called my brother because he owes me money.   I called him just to tell him I'm here in Nuevo Laredo. Send me some money   because I got to come home. [Chuckles]. Well, yeah, that's how they found   out I got deported. I'm pretty sure they would’ve helped me; they gave me   some money. But after that, no. That's when I got here.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Detention, Reasons, Treatment by">Noe: No. I was just by myself. My only family, they all stay in California,   and I was by myself in ____, Iowa. I didn't really want to call them,   because they say [inaudible] They were never going to support me.     Lizzy: They wouldn't support you?     Noe: No.     Lizzy: Can you tell me more about that? They wouldn't support you in terms   of that they would be upset with you, or just that they wouldn't help you?     Noe: I think they would help me, but they would be disappointed of me.   They'd say, “Why you do this?” or something like that. I rather not to call   them or tell them about...     Lizzy: They didn't know that you were detained?     Noe: No, they didn't know.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Detention, Reasons, Treatment by">Noe: Yeah there was a lot of hunger in there. You can't save food either.   Cause I remember we used to save the peanut butter sandwich to keep it for   later on, for late night, so we wouldn't get hungry. They would search you   so if they found you everything that's ... They will penalize you, either   with the hole and everything, or twenty-four hours locked in. It's kind of   hard.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Detention, Reasons, Treatment by">Noe: It's just gross. The portions are none literally. Sometimes they give   you rotten milk—just little boxes, like little milk boxes, like a little   carton thing. Yeah, so sometimes there's hair in the food. Sometimes it's   just the portions, literally, they just like shoved in like a half of a   spoon, just throw it in there. What else besides the hair..?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Detention, Reasons, Treatment by">Noe: Not bad, but they always intimidating, like trying to ... It's like   you are in jail, I guess. They don't want anyone to feel that they can make   whatever they want with them, or trying to intimidate the [inaudible], or   any other type of misconduct, I would say.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Arrests, Misdemeanors, Traffic Offenses">Lizzy: You weren't the driver?

It wasn't a   beer, but it was just a small glass from the bar that he took. They decided   to charge us both with open container. When I got into—well they just   detained me. Well, they scanned me literally, they run all my information,   they didn't find any social security number. That's how they called ICE.   ICE literally detained me for about a month before I decided to sign on my   deportation because I was sick of the jail. I was just tired and   everything. I speak to the judge once, “Okay, we'll see you for the next   court.” I was like, “No.” I was so sick already because I spent in County   for about four months as I remember, and then one more month with ICE. I   was just sick of it. I was like, “No, I just want to go.”    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Arrests, Misdemeanors, Traffic Offenses">Lizzy: Let's back up just a little bit to what led to you getting deported.     Noe: I was just having a good time with a friend. I was not the driver.   First, we got detained for swinging lines.     Lizzy: What?     Noe: Swinging lines, like roughly driving, like reckless driving. Well, we   were kind of a little bit of drinking. They were like, “Okay, drinking and   driving.” I was like, “Oh well.” I thought I was not going to get arrested,   but the people decide to arrest me.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Higher Education, Opportunities from">Noe: Yeah, the community college. It was one year and a half only, but it   was only in generals before I decided what to do. I was undecided between   being a dentist or a medical assistant. I was just going to generals before   I decide, and I was making my own investigation about salaries—first   priority was money, then timing, and then work bills and everything around   the community. Luckily, I didn't get to really get into the college about   my major. Well, after I return, I came to my small village—    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  careers">Noe: Well, to get me into, how you say, the living style over there. I   adapted very well. I graduate, I start moving by myself. I move into my own   apartment. My own connections. After that, I became a chef. It was a little   bit of an expert on the kitchen. I got an offer, a job offer, from Iowa   about a restaurant opening. They offered me a pretty good salary, and I   didn't have to pay rent, so I didn't think twice about moving out there. I   opened the restaurant. They were really happy with my work. They were doing   very well. I set up everything right.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Mexican childhood, Memories">Noe: I was fifteen. Yeah, you're not sixteen, I think, you cannot work over   there. I was just having a little, small part-time. After that I went to   ___ High School. I went there and after I moved to ____, which is, I got my   GED from there. Well, it was just fine. I was growing up, making friends   and everything. I got used to the city. I got used to, how can I say?   Literally, the U.S., it swallowed me right away. [Chuckle].    </span> Lizzy: It swallowed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, it swallowed me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well, to get me into, how you say, the living style over there.

I set up everything right.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well after six months, I decided to return to California because I</br>   thought I was missing the weather because it's really cold over there in</br>   Iowa. Well, after I saw the living expenses in California and living</br>   expenses in Iowa, I make my statement. I was like, “No, I'm not staying in</br>   California anymore.” Then I decided to move for good to Iowa. I went to</br>   WITCC [Western Iowa Tech Community College].

There's hair</br>   everywhere. Everything is dirty. It smells. The beds are hard. They give</br>   you like, a little mattress like this, and it's just plastic. No, it's</br>   undescribable. If you've never been there, it's undescribable. You can't</br>   sleep because you always have to be aware.

If</br>   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,</br>   and not even five minutes, they will be answering you with the</br>   approve—well, the bus will have to take you to Guerrero.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To take you to Guerrero?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It was nice, I was like, “Okay.” I just told my brother to send me</br>   money to Guerrero. I get to my house. That was it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did that feel like being back in your home?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: [Exhale]. It was just awful. As I say, nobody knew me. I didn't know</br>   nobody besides my family, my close friends and family, close family.</br>   Besides my neighbors, they didn't know who I was. I didn't know who they</br>   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids</br>   five years old, they were almost twenty-five by then. I was like, “No.” It</br>   was exciting getting to know more people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you feel like you were returning home, or did you feel like an</br>   outsider?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I felt like an outsider. Yeah, definitely an outsider. Well,</br>   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.</br>   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you</br>   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or</br>   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just</br>   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I</br>   was like, “No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How long did you stay there before you came to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About one year. I've been living one year here. I've been jumping job</br>   by job. Some jobs did not accept me because I don’t have the high school</br>   diploma—that's why I'm trying to get it. Luckily, T-Tech they accept you.</br>   They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As</br>   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you like working at T-Tech?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I've only been working there for two weeks, but I think I'm going to</br>   like a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What do you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to</br>   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high</br>   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There’s no…</br>   a lot of people speak English better than me, like, “Go eff yourself.”</br> </br> </br>   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs</br>   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't</br>   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the</br>   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for three months. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is</br>   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,</br>   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for</br>   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of</br>   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I</br>   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the</br>   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.</br>   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went</br>   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the</br>   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying</br>   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to</br>   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you</br>   guys thinking about?”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like you had a different work ethic than your coworkers</br>   there. Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the U.S.</br>   culture, I guess? In the U.S., you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and</br>   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I</br>   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really</br>   ask for rewards and everything. I remember one time, a lady—a messy girl</br>   from the streets, I think she was homeless—she showed up at the restaurant,</br>   and was like, “Hey, is this yours?” It was my wallet. I was like, “Yeah.</br>   Where you found it?” “Here. There's a lot of money in there, so take care</br>   of it.” I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was</br>   like, “Hey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you</br>   want.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: She was like, “Oh no no, I got to go. I got to go.” I was like, “You</br>   sure? Come on, let me cook something for you. You can have it for later.</br>   You can have it for to go. “No no, no, thank you, thank you, thank you.”</br>   She just left. I was like, “Wow.” And here, I already lost my wallet once.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Nobody returned it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I ain't got no call. I got nothing. I got nothing for it. That's what</br>   I hate about this.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had mentioned in the survey you got attacked and your belongings</br>   stolen. Can you tell me about that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Oh yeah. I was hanging out with my friend. She's a girl, short girl,</br>   and I didn't really know. Those guys, they came to us with the knives. They</br>   pull out the knives. They came to me, they put a knife on my neck, and</br>   another one in my stomach, like say, “Don't move, don't move.” But as they</br>   say that, I didn't show that I was afraid of them. I was just like, “Okay,</br>   calm down. Take whatever you want. Don't do anything stupid, something like</br>   that.” I didn't want to do anything—hit back or something and run</br>   away—because I was with the girl. I was just more scared about her. She was</br>   super scared. I was like, “Just take that, just go.” Yeah, after that,</br>   there was a police station two blocks from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you go to the police?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, we went to the police. She filed a report and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did they do? Nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Nothing. Nothing at all. I don't think she got contacted or something,</br>   and I don't think they did something. It's just like a regular thing around</br>   here. You get jacked and they steal your stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had said that you don't feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. To be honest, I don't feel safe. I'm always on guard, like</br>   everything. When I see people, as long as I’m by myself, and I see people</br>   getting close to me, I'm going to get just on guard. I see something you're</br>   trying to do to me, I'm just going to scream and run. [Chuckle]. I don't</br>   feel safe. I’m always aware. When I'm on the subway, on the streets, I'm</br>   always checking my pockets around, “Oh, I still have my wallet, still have</br>   my ... “ It's just a daily thing, I have to check everything. When I get</br>   out and get into the bus, I have to check my wallet. I get out, I check my</br>   wallet and everything. If you drop anything, somebody take it, you're never</br>   going to see that item again.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like it's a stress that's always—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, yeah. Have to be aware, have to be aware, have to be aware!</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you ever feel like that in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all. Never. I used to go to ___ in the morning, Chinatown,</br>   by myself. Nothing ever happened. It's just definitely a different world, I</br>   would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Different world here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Different people as well. People here is just—I know there's good</br>   people, but it's just, I hate some people really. They super selfish, they</br>   only worry about them. They don't give a damn about anybody else. What can</br>   they do to hurt the other people? For them, it's just them, them, them,</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think that there's people like that here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: One example from the subway, there's a lot of people that they don't</br>   care about the others. I always tell it to my friends when I get to speak</br>   about the city that when I came here, I was giving seats to the ladies, to</br>   the girls. “Hey, take a seat and everything.” The people get crowded at the</br>   door when the subway open the door, they just get crowded. Everybody wants</br>   to get in. I was like, for real, just stepping aside, just trying to let</br>   them go, and then I get in. Now? Nah. They crowd in, I go too. I have to be</br>   like, “I don't give a damn about you.” There are ladies forties, maybe</br>   fifties, they're nice, but I'm not giving my chair. Only if I see a really</br>   elderly lady, “Okay, just take a seat there.” That makes a big change on</br>   you and how you were raised. It's a lot of, the city takes a lot from you:</br>   take your manners, take your... If you're kind to people, get ready,</br>   because this city is going to change you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You feel like it's changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. For real. I feel like it's taking the manners from you. What</br>   else? Kindness. The people ask you for money and everything. They're just</br>   crazy. There's a guy in good working condition, just like, “Hey, give me</br>   some money.” Get out of my face, get the fuck out of my face, because I</br>   can't stand those people. In good, working condition, they can have a job.</br>   I got this in my mind, if you in that condition, a homeless condition, it’s</br>   because you wanted to. You have two hands, two feet, I don't see that you</br>   suffer sickness or something like that, that will not allow you to work or</br>   to have a job. There's a lot of work around here. There's work everywhere.</br>   You just have to want to work first. That makes me mad a lot. Get out of</br>   here, get out of my face, because I can't stand them. I can't stand the</br>   people. I can’t stand that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's been the biggest challenge for you? What's been hardest for</br>   you being back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: The biggest challenge I would say is to adapt and to accept people the</br>   way they are because obviously they're not in the US. It's hard for me to</br>   accept, to ignore them, to see if someone has stolen something, is not</br>   doing things right. It's hard to me to keep quiet. So, to adapt and to</br>   accept these people. That's really hard. Sometimes I just feel like I want</br>   to scream at people and yell at them. Just, “Get a job, just do something</br>   for your life.” It's like, “Do a job. Everybody's getting a job. Why are</br>   you jacking off? Why are you just jacking people on the streets or trying</br>   to defraud and make fraud everywhere? Just get a job or something.” That</br>   makes me mad, because I have a job. I'm paying taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, you work hard.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, why you not? For real? I work hard and I pay taxes, so we have a</br>   decent city. You just wake up, go to the bus, and ask for money? That's it?</br>   That makes me mad, for real.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you think that for some people, they're not able to get a job</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I bet there's some people that are not able to get a job, but there's</br>   a small fraction. Super, super, super small fraction. Let's say, for every</br>   hundred people, at least only two of the people there really are disabled,</br>   not able to get a job. The rest, they just don't want to get a job. For</br>   example, those immigrants that came from Honduras. A couple of them, they</br>   get into the bus, they say, “Just give me money. I don't have any</br>   paperwork.” Dude, you don't need a paperwork. There's a food stand that is</br>   asking for a server or something. You just fill out an application and ask</br>   them for a job. Explain the situation. You say you really need a job, and</br>   you want to work, they're not going to reject you. They're not going to let</br>   you in the streets. And that’s the reason that they're asking for money</br>   like that. Just get out. Get out of here. I'm not going to give you my</br>   money. I'm giving you money to [inaudible 00:31:53] you can have a life,</br>   you can have all type of programs. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I might be a dick</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's okay. I like honesty. I would rather have an honest answer.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. That's me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What about, to switch over to a positive note to end on, what's been</br>   the most positive thing for you, or what's been the best part of being back</br>   in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Hmm. Getting to know more about my culture. That's one thing. I've</br>   been reading a lot of books about Mexico. Not the culture right now, but</br>   the culture of Mexico, Hispanic Mexico. Visiting the temples, to</br>   Teotihuacan, have you been there? Those are not, they're pyramids, but it's</br>   called temples. The temples, there's a lot of things. For example, there's</br>   a lot of history on my little village that used to be home of the Aztecs.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: The what?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Aztecs.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Oh okay, yes. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Cuauhtemoc, a big icon about the Aztec. Cuauhtemoc, they used to live</br>   there. There's a lot of finds that have been happening around the village.</br>   Whenever I go, when I have a chance, I go up there, and just explore the</br>   caves. I've been finding paintings, prehistoric paintings. There's a lot of</br>   culture that I've been seeing that I like. That's one thing, that I'm</br>   getting to know more of my country. Well, my family. I get to see my family</br>   more often. If I stay in the US, I will never come, like, “Ah, it's</br>   Mexico.” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When you lived in the US, were you ever able to visit Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all, due to my immigration status. It's like everything.</br>   The U.S.A. just swallow you into the system. And it's fine. It's working.</br>   The thing that you not able to leave the country, you get used to it, like,</br>   “Oh, it's just Mexico.” I was just playing. To be honest, I would never</br>   come back. I would never come back if I wouldn't have deported, so that's</br>   one positive thing about the deportation. I got to know my country, my</br>   culture. Got to spend more time with my family. If it wouldn’t have been</br>   like that, I would never have come to Mexico. Yeah, I think all the people</br>   that leave Mexico and emigrate to the US, we do the same thing. “Okay, next</br>   year, I'm going to go to Mexico.” The year goes by, and the year go by.</br>   “Okay, in two years, I'm going to try to save my money and I'm going to</br>   Mexico.” The two years go by, and it just goes by, goes by, it goes by, it</br>   goes by. It's just like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It would be very difficult, because you would have to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Cross the border again. Well, you know that things are getting more</br>   hard on the border. There's a lot of chances that you might not make it.</br>   Obviously, the cartels, they took over the border already. Either you pay a</br>   lot of money or you're a mule or they just not let you in. They'll kill</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What are your hopes for your future now back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's to get a better job. I know call centers, they pay pretty well,</br>   more than on the street or working in construction, but my plan right now</br>   is to get on track in my studies, get my GED, get to university, get some</br>   career. Well, to get a career as quick as possible because I'm not speaking</br>   about ten years from now or five years from now, I'm speaking—well maybe</br>   five years. Ten years is too much. I'm trying to hurry up as quick as</br>   possible and get a job.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you want to be a chef again, or something else?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. It's going to be something else, but food has always been my</br>   passion. I'm planning to get my diploma on PMP. You know what PMP is?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's like a programming managing, it's computers, technology. After</br>   that, I'm planning to open my own restaurant. Start from the bottom,</br>   obviously, and open a small restaurant to see how it goes from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Japanese.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Japanese food?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. One of my plans is to go to the US because I have ten years</br>   deportation, so after ten years I'll see what I can do to that. Hopefully</br>   by then I'll have my restaurant at full potential and to get some chains to</br>   the U.S., maybe South America. Canada is one of my targets as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To live?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: To live as well, Canada. Well for business as well. Have U.S. and</br>   Canada for business.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Opening up restaurants?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Opening restaurant. Small restaurants, to make a chain—not so</br>   expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of Japanese food do you like to cook?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well, I just go from stir fry into fried, like tempura things, sushi</br>   rolls. There's a million sushi rolls that I can make. Mostly typical more</br>   homemade Japanese food—let's say like ramens, house ramens, and everything.</br>   Some products from Japan, like specifically like a, how I say? Those</br>   products that you can't get anywhere except Japan, so I'm trying to do that</br>   as well. That's one of my priorities as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why Japan?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Because I like their culture. I've been raised with Japanese people as</br>   well, and well I specialize. Out of the ten years of the kitchen, seven</br>   years they were only for Japanese food. I know Italian, Chinese, Korean,</br>   but Japanese is the one that captured my attention. All the rolls and</br>   everything, the flavors. I know here, their palette, the Mexican people,</br>   their taste, they are not really like aware of flavors. I'm working on it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You can teach them how to like it.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, one example, when I first got into my village, I make a shrimp</br>   fried rice with fruit spring rolls. They only ate the spring rolls. They</br>   didn't like the fried rice with the shrimp. They’re like, “This is the best</br>   thing that you gave me?” There is a big pot, maybe three pounds, three</br>   pounds of rice. It was decent. “No, I don't like the rice, because it's</br>   just rice.” “Eat it with the chopsticks, I don't think you guys can use it,</br>   so use a fork.” They're like, “No, I don't want to eat just rice.” “Why?”</br>   “Because I'm not a chicken.” I'm like, “Just eat it.” And now they're</br>   saying, “Oh it just tastes like garlic.” “That's what fried rice tastes</br>   like! Okay, fuck it! Just leave it, I'll just eat it all by myself.” Yeah,</br>   they didn't like it. Some of my friends, they like it, but my family, my</br>   parents, they're like super Mexican. [Chuckles]. They don't really used to</br>   a different type. They give you beans, tortillas, and pork meat, and beef</br>   meat. They're happy with it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Well, hopefully one day, if you have a Japanese restaurant, they'll</br>   come eat there and learn all about the food.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
