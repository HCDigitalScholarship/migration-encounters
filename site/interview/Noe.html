   childhood?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Noe: I was born in a city called Tasco. Actually, my parents, they're from<br>
   a small village around thirty minutes from the city. The village is really<br>
   small. As I remember, we used to have dirt houses, small dirt houses. What<br>
   else? We didn't have any… Like the roads, it's like dust and ground, like<br>
   raw ground roads. What else? I remember that the people, they used to were<br>
   more kind. it was just love everywhere in my childhood. I used to be<br>
   shepherd, I used to have a sheep. I used to go to the mountains with my<br>
   sheeps, trying to feed them and everything. I used to have one small cow. I<br>
   used to have two horses and everything. After I immigrate to the US with<br>
   none English, I went there, live with my brother first, and I started went<br>
   to school, and started looking for a job actually. I was underage, so my<br>
   parents have to sign off the sheet for me to get a job.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Lizzy: And you were fifteen at that time, right?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was fifteen. Yeah, you're not sixteen, I think, you cannot work over</br>   there. I was just having a little, small part-time. After that I went to</br>   ___ High School. I went there and after I moved to ____, which is, I got my</br>   GED from there. Well, it was just fine. I was growing up, making friends</br>   and everything. I got used to the city. I got used to, how can I say?</br>   Literally, the U.S., it swallowed me right away. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It swallowed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, it swallowed me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well, to get me into, how you say, the living style over there. I</br>   adapted very well. I graduate, I start moving by myself. I move into my own</br>   apartment. My own connections. After that, I became a chef. It was a little</br>   bit of an expert on the kitchen. I got an offer, a job offer, from Iowa</br>   about a restaurant opening. They offered me a pretty good salary, and I</br>   didn't have to pay rent, so I didn't think twice about moving out there. I</br>   opened the restaurant. They were really happy with my work. They were doing</br>   very well. I set up everything right.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well after six months, I decided to return to California because I</br>   thought I was missing the weather because it's really cold over there in</br>   Iowa. Well, after I saw the living expenses in California and living</br>   expenses in Iowa, I make my statement. I was like, “No, I'm not staying in</br>   California anymore.” Then I decided to move for good to Iowa. I went to</br>   WITCC [Western Iowa Tech Community College]. I was trying to go for a</br>   dentist.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That was the community college that you went to?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, the community college. It was one year and a half only, but it</br>   was only in generals before I decided what to do. I was undecided between</br>   being a dentist or a medical assistant. I was just going to generals before</br>   I decide, and I was making my own investigation about salaries—first</br>   priority was money, then timing, and then work bills and everything around</br>   the community. Luckily, I didn't get to really get into the college about</br>   my major. Well, after I return, I came to my small village—</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Let's back up just a little bit to what led to you getting deported.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was just having a good time with a friend. I was not the driver.</br>   First, we got detained for swinging lines.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Swinging lines, like roughly driving, like reckless driving. Well, we</br>   were kind of a little bit of drinking. They were like, “Okay, drinking and</br>   driving.” I was like, “Oh well.” I thought I was not going to get arrested,</br>   but the people decide to arrest me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You weren't the driver?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I wasn't the driver, no.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Your friend was arrested for reckless driving, and what was your</br>   charge?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: We charged for… Because that guy had an open container. It wasn't a</br>   beer, but it was just a small glass from the bar that he took. They decided</br>   to charge us both with open container. When I got into—well they just</br>   detained me. Well, they scanned me literally, they run all my information,</br>   they didn't find any social security number. That's how they called ICE.</br>   ICE literally detained me for about a month before I decided to sign on my</br>   deportation because I was sick of the jail. I was just tired and</br>   everything. I speak to the judge once, “Okay, we'll see you for the next</br>   court.” I was like, “No.” I was so sick already because I spent in County</br>   for about four months as I remember, and then one more month with ICE. I</br>   was just sick of it. I was like, “No, I just want to go.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You decided you would rather leave and be deported back to Mexico</br>   than stay in detention longer?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Uh-huh. I was like, ”No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What were the conditions like in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Detention, it's just disgusting. It's just disgusting. There's hair</br>   everywhere. Everything is dirty. It smells. The beds are hard. They give</br>   you like, a little mattress like this, and it's just plastic. No, it's</br>   undescribable. If you've never been there, it's undescribable. You can't</br>   sleep because you always have to be aware. You never know who's going to</br>   come through that door or who's going to be sleeping with you on the next</br>   bunker. Yeah, it's rough. And you get sick there. I was just sick of it. I</br>   was like, give me my deportation. I just want to go.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How did they treat you there?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Not bad, but they always intimidating, like trying to ... It's like</br>   you are in jail, I guess. They don't want anyone to feel that they can make</br>   whatever they want with them, or trying to intimidate the [inaudible], or</br>   any other type of misconduct, I would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, misconduct.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, it's just hard. It’s undescribable.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What was the food like?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's just gross. The portions are none literally. Sometimes they give</br>   you rotten milk—just little boxes, like little milk boxes, like a little</br>   carton thing. Yeah, so sometimes there's hair in the food. Sometimes it's</br>   just the portions, literally, they just like shoved in like a half of a</br>   spoon, just throw it in there. What else besides the hair..?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You were hungry a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah there was a lot of hunger in there. You can't save food either.</br>   Cause I remember we used to save the peanut butter sandwich to keep it for</br>   later on, for late night, so we wouldn't get hungry. They would search you</br>   so if they found you everything that's ... They will penalize you, either</br>   with the hole and everything, or twenty-four hours locked in. It's kind of</br>   hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Big punishment just for trying to save food for later?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. Well... [Chuckles]. You're in there, you can't do anything.</br>   You're just one more number and one more inmate.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Were any of your family members or friends able to come visit you</br>   while you were in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. I was just by myself. My only family, they all stay in California,</br>   and I was by myself in ____, Iowa. I didn't really want to call them,</br>   because they say [inaudible] They were never going to support me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They wouldn't support you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Can you tell me more about that? They wouldn't support you in terms</br>   of that they would be upset with you, or just that they wouldn't help you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I think they would help me, but they would be disappointed of me.</br>   They'd say, “Why you do this?” or something like that. I rather not to call</br>   them or tell them about...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't know that you were detained?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, they didn't know.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When did they find out?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: When I got deported. [Chuckles]. When I got deported, I got released</br>   on… What's it called? Nuevo Laredo, it's like the Texas border. I got</br>   released over there, and then I called my brother because he owes me money.</br>   I called him just to tell him I'm here in Nuevo Laredo. Send me some money</br>   because I got to come home. [Chuckles]. Well, yeah, that's how they found</br>   out I got deported. I'm pretty sure they would’ve helped me; they gave me</br>   some money. But after that, no. That's when I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you remember what it was like that day crossing the bridge from</br>   Texas back into Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. I will never forget that. They just gave you this small bag with</br>   your belongs, [Chuckles] which is like clothes from jail, so they're not</br>   really good. They give you small needs, like a bag with needs, with</br>   everything. They just release you. They take all the chains off. They're</br>   just like, “Get off the bus, walk across the bridge.” That's it. Well, you</br>   had to cross it. [Chuckle]. What other choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did you do when you were across the bridge?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was a little scared, a little excited about a new thing, but I was</br>   just thinking too much—like I don't have money, where am I going to go?</br>   What I going to do? There was a lot of rumors about the cartels recruiting</br>   immigrants as soon as you cross the bridge; they going to make you get into</br>   a car, and they going to take you from there. If you with them or not, they</br>   going to kill you. I was just looking around like, “Where's the car?</br>   Where's the car?” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you have any experience like that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, not really. Luckily, I got welcomed by this group of people—the</br>   one I mentioned. They literally just went, “Okay, where are you going?” I'm</br>   like, “Oh, I'm going to Guerrero.” “Okay, so listen. We are from the</br>   Mexican government. We here to assist you and help with everything that you</br>   might need.” I was like, “Okay.” “Just come with us.” it was a little scary</br>   because they say, “Okay, just come with us,” and they just take you around</br>   the building. You don't even know, what other choice do you have? You</br>   either stay with them or just stay in the street?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And you're not sure whether it's safe to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: No other choice?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They say they from the government and they have a little logo, a</br>   Mexico logo, so I was like, “Okay. I'm going to just go with them. Whatever</br>   happens is going to happen.” They give you access to computers to</br>   communicate with your family and everything. That's when I got in contact</br>   with my brother. I was just like, “Send me some money here. I'm going to</br>   need for my bus ride at least.” Then one of the guys heard me: “Hey, where</br>   did you say you were from?” I'm like, “I'm from Guerrero.” “Oh, Guerrero, I</br>   think Guerrero have some programs about immigrants from their state. It’s</br>   their people, and they take care of them.” Yeah, if you're an immigrant</br>   from my state like Guerrero, and you were born there, they will pay you. If</br>   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,</br>   and not even five minutes, they will be answering you with the</br>   approve—well, the bus will have to take you to Guerrero.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To take you to Guerrero?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It was nice, I was like, “Okay.” I just told my brother to send me</br>   money to Guerrero. I get to my house. That was it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did that feel like being back in your home?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: [Exhale]. It was just awful. As I say, nobody knew me. I didn't know</br>   nobody besides my family, my close friends and family, close family.</br>   Besides my neighbors, they didn't know who I was. I didn't know who they</br>   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids</br>   five years old, they were almost twenty-five by then. I was like, “No.” It</br>   was exciting getting to know more people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you feel like you were returning home, or did you feel like an</br>   outsider?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I felt like an outsider. Yeah, definitely an outsider. Well,</br>   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.</br>   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you</br>   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or</br>   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just</br>   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I</br>   was like, “No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How long did you stay there before you came to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About one year. I've been living one year here. I've been jumping job</br>   by job. Some jobs did not accept me because I don’t have the high school</br>   diploma—that's why I'm trying to get it. Luckily, T-Tech they accept you.</br>   They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As</br>   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you like working at T-Tech?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I've only been working there for two weeks, but I think I'm going to</br>   like a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What do you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to</br>   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high</br>   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There’s no…</br>   a lot of people speak English better than me, like, “Go eff yourself.”</br> </br> </br>   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs</br>   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't</br>   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the</br>   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for three months. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is</br>   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,</br>   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for</br>   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of</br>   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I</br>   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the</br>   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.</br>   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went</br>   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the</br>   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying</br>   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to</br>   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you</br>   guys thinking about?”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like you had a different work ethic than your coworkers</br>   there. Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the U.S.</br>   culture, I guess? In the U.S., you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and</br>   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I</br>   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really</br>   ask for rewards and everything. I remember one time, a lady—a messy girl</br>   from the streets, I think she was homeless—she showed up at the restaurant,</br>   and was like, “Hey, is this yours?” It was my wallet. I was like, “Yeah.</br>   Where you found it?” “Here. There's a lot of money in there, so take care</br>   of it.” I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was</br>   like, “Hey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you</br>   want.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: She was like, “Oh no no, I got to go. I got to go.” I was like, “You</br>   sure? Come on, let me cook something for you. You can have it for later.</br>   You can have it for to go. “No no, no, thank you, thank you, thank you.”</br>   She just left. I was like, “Wow.” And here, I already lost my wallet once.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Nobody returned it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I ain't got no call. I got nothing. I got nothing for it. That's what</br>   I hate about this.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had mentioned in the survey you got attacked and your belongings</br>   stolen. Can you tell me about that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Oh yeah. I was hanging out with my friend. She's a girl, short girl,</br>   and I didn't really know. Those guys, they came to us with the knives. They</br>   pull out the knives. They came to me, they put a knife on my neck, and</br>   another one in my stomach, like say, “Don't move, don't move.” But as they</br>   say that, I didn't show that I was afraid of them. I was just like, “Okay,</br>   calm down. Take whatever you want. Don't do anything stupid, something like</br>   that.” I didn't want to do anything—hit back or something and run</br>   away—because I was with the girl. I was just more scared about her. She was</br>   super scared. I was like, “Just take that, just go.” Yeah, after that,</br>   there was a police station two blocks from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you go to the police?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, we went to the police. She filed a report and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did they do? Nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Nothing. Nothing at all. I don't think she got contacted or something,</br>   and I don't think they did something. It's just like a regular thing around</br>   here. You get jacked and they steal your stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had said that you don't feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. To be honest, I don't feel safe. I'm always on guard, like</br>   everything. When I see people, as long as I’m by myself, and I see people</br>   getting close to me, I'm going to get just on guard. I see something you're</br>   trying to do to me, I'm just going to scream and run. [Chuckle]. I don't</br>   feel safe. I’m always aware. When I'm on the subway, on the streets, I'm</br>   always checking my pockets around, “Oh, I still have my wallet, still have</br>   my ... “ It's just a daily thing, I have to check everything. When I get</br>   out and get into the bus, I have to check my wallet. I get out, I check my</br>   wallet and everything. If you drop anything, somebody take it, you're never</br>   going to see that item again.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like it's a stress that's always—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, yeah. Have to be aware, have to be aware, have to be aware!</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you ever feel like that in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all. Never. I used to go to ___ in the morning, Chinatown,</br>   by myself. Nothing ever happened. It's just definitely a different world, I</br>   would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Different world here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Different people as well. People here is just—I know there's good</br>   people, but it's just, I hate some people really. They super selfish, they</br>   only worry about them. They don't give a damn about anybody else. What can</br>   they do to hurt the other people? For them, it's just them, them, them,</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think that there's people like that here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: One example from the subway, there's a lot of people that they don't</br>   care about the others. I always tell it to my friends when I get to speak</br>   about the city that when I came here, I was giving seats to the ladies, to</br>   the girls. “Hey, take a seat and everything.” The people get crowded at the</br>   door when the subway open the door, they just get crowded. Everybody wants</br>   to get in. I was like, for real, just stepping aside, just trying to let</br>   them go, and then I get in. Now? Nah. They crowd in, I go too. I have to be</br>   like, “I don't give a damn about you.” There are ladies forties, maybe</br>   fifties, they're nice, but I'm not giving my chair. Only if I see a really</br>   elderly lady, “Okay, just take a seat there.” That makes a big change on</br>   you and how you were raised. It's a lot of, the city takes a lot from you:</br>   take your manners, take your... If you're kind to people, get ready,</br>   because this city is going to change you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You feel like it's changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. For real. I feel like it's taking the manners from you. What</br>   else? Kindness. The people ask you for money and everything. They're just</br>   crazy. There's a guy in good working condition, just like, “Hey, give me</br>   some money.” Get out of my face, get the fuck out of my face, because I</br>   can't stand those people. In good, working condition, they can have a job.</br>   I got this in my mind, if you in that condition, a homeless condition, it’s</br>   because you wanted to. You have two hands, two feet, I don't see that you</br>   suffer sickness or something like that, that will not allow you to work or</br>   to have a job. There's a lot of work around here. There's work everywhere.</br>   You just have to want to work first. That makes me mad a lot. Get out of</br>   here, get out of my face, because I can't stand them. I can't stand the</br>   people. I can’t stand that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's been the biggest challenge for you? What's been hardest for</br>   you being back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: The biggest challenge I would say is to adapt and to accept people the</br>   way they are because obviously they're not in the US. It's hard for me to</br>   accept, to ignore them, to see if someone has stolen something, is not</br>   doing things right. It's hard to me to keep quiet. So, to adapt and to</br>   accept these people. That's really hard. Sometimes I just feel like I want</br>   to scream at people and yell at them. Just, “Get a job, just do something</br>   for your life.” It's like, “Do a job. Everybody's getting a job. Why are</br>   you jacking off? Why are you just jacking people on the streets or trying</br>   to defraud and make fraud everywhere? Just get a job or something.” That</br>   makes me mad, because I have a job. I'm paying taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, you work hard.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, why you not? For real? I work hard and I pay taxes, so we have a</br>   decent city. You just wake up, go to the bus, and ask for money? That's it?</br>   That makes me mad, for real.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you think that for some people, they're not able to get a job</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I bet there's some people that are not able to get a job, but there's</br>   a small fraction. Super, super, super small fraction. Let's say, for every</br>   hundred people, at least only two of the people there really are disabled,</br>   not able to get a job. The rest, they just don't want to get a job. For</br>   example, those immigrants that came from Honduras. A couple of them, they</br>   get into the bus, they say, “Just give me money. I don't have any</br>   paperwork.” Dude, you don't need a paperwork. There's a food stand that is</br>   asking for a server or something. You just fill out an application and ask</br>   them for a job. Explain the situation. You say you really need a job, and</br>   you want to work, they're not going to reject you. They're not going to let</br>   you in the streets. And that’s the reason that they're asking for money</br>   like that. Just get out. Get out of here. I'm not going to give you my</br>   money. I'm giving you money to [inaudible 00:31:53] you can have a life,</br>   you can have all type of programs. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I might be a dick</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's okay. I like honesty. I would rather have an honest answer.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. That's me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What about, to switch over to a positive note to end on, what's been</br>   the most positive thing for you, or what's been the best part of being back</br>   in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Hmm. Getting to know more about my culture. That's one thing. I've</br>   been reading a lot of books about Mexico. Not the culture right now, but</br>   the culture of Mexico, Hispanic Mexico. Visiting the temples, to</br>   Teotihuacan, have you been there? Those are not, they're pyramids, but it's</br>   called temples. The temples, there's a lot of things. For example, there's</br>   a lot of history on my little village that used to be home of the Aztecs.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: The what?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Aztecs.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Oh okay, yes. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Cuauhtemoc, a big icon about the Aztec. Cuauhtemoc, they used to live</br>   there. There's a lot of finds that have been happening around the village.</br>   Whenever I go, when I have a chance, I go up there, and just explore the</br>   caves. I've been finding paintings, prehistoric paintings. There's a lot of</br>   culture that I've been seeing that I like. That's one thing, that I'm</br>   getting to know more of my country. Well, my family. I get to see my family</br>   more often. If I stay in the US, I will never come, like, “Ah, it's</br>   Mexico.” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When you lived in the US, were you ever able to visit Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all, due to my immigration status. It's like everything.</br>   The U.S.A. just swallow you into the system. And it's fine. It's working.</br>   The thing that you not able to leave the country, you get used to it, like,</br>   “Oh, it's just Mexico.” I was just playing. To be honest, I would never</br>   come back. I would never come back if I wouldn't have deported, so that's</br>   one positive thing about the deportation. I got to know my country, my</br>   culture. Got to spend more time with my family. If it wouldn’t have been</br>   like that, I would never have come to Mexico. Yeah, I think all the people</br>   that leave Mexico and emigrate to the US, we do the same thing. “Okay, next</br>   year, I'm going to go to Mexico.” The year goes by, and the year go by.</br>   “Okay, in two years, I'm going to try to save my money and I'm going to</br>   Mexico.” The two years go by, and it just goes by, goes by, it goes by, it</br>   goes by. It's just like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It would be very difficult, because you would have to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Cross the border again. Well, you know that things are getting more</br>   hard on the border. There's a lot of chances that you might not make it.</br>   Obviously, the cartels, they took over the border already. Either you pay a</br>   lot of money or you're a mule or they just not let you in. They'll kill</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What are your hopes for your future now back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's to get a better job. I know call centers, they pay pretty well,</br>   more than on the street or working in construction, but my plan right now</br>   is to get on track in my studies, get my GED, get to university, get some</br>   career. Well, to get a career as quick as possible because I'm not speaking</br>   about ten years from now or five years from now, I'm speaking—well maybe</br>   five years. Ten years is too much. I'm trying to hurry up as quick as</br>   possible and get a job.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you want to be a chef again, or something else?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. It's going to be something else, but food has always been my</br>   passion. I'm planning to get my diploma on PMP. You know what PMP is?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's like a programming managing, it's computers, technology. After</br>   that, I'm planning to open my own restaurant. Start from the bottom,</br>   obviously, and open a small restaurant to see how it goes from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Japanese.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Japanese food?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. One of my plans is to go to the US because I have ten years</br>   deportation, so after ten years I'll see what I can do to that. Hopefully</br>   by then I'll have my restaurant at full potential and to get some chains to</br>   the U.S., maybe South America. Canada is one of my targets as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To live?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: To live as well, Canada. Well for business as well. Have U.S. and</br>   Canada for business.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Opening up restaurants?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Opening restaurant. Small restaurants, to make a chain—not so</br>   expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of Japanese food do you like to cook?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well, I just go from stir fry into fried, like tempura things, sushi</br>   rolls. There's a million sushi rolls that I can make. Mostly typical more</br>   homemade Japanese food—let's say like ramens, house ramens, and everything.</br>   Some products from Japan, like specifically like a, how I say? Those</br>   products that you can't get anywhere except Japan, so I'm trying to do that</br>   as well. That's one of my priorities as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why Japan?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Because I like their culture. I've been raised with Japanese people as</br>   well, and well I specialize. Out of the ten years of the kitchen, seven</br>   years they were only for Japanese food. I know Italian, Chinese, Korean,</br>   but Japanese is the one that captured my attention. All the rolls and</br>   everything, the flavors. I know here, their palette, the Mexican people,</br>   their taste, they are not really like aware of flavors. I'm working on it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You can teach them how to like it.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="b4b739b9-db37-4e10-a1bf-a7b347af6074" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Noe: Yeah, one example, when I first got into my village, I make a shrimp<br>
   fried rice with fruit spring rolls. They only ate the spring rolls. They<br>
   didn't like the fried rice with the shrimp. They’re like, “This is the best<br>
   thing that you gave me?” There is a big pot, maybe three pounds, three<br>
   pounds of rice. It was decent. “No, I don't like the rice, because it's<br>
   just rice.” “Eat it with the chopsticks, I don't think you guys can use it,<br>
   so use a fork.” They're like, “No, I don't want to eat just rice.” “Why?”<br>
   “Because I'm not a chicken.” I'm like, “Just eat it.” And now they're<br>
   saying, “Oh it just tastes like garlic.” “That's what fried rice tastes<br>
   like! Okay, fuck it! Just leave it, I'll just eat it all by myself.” Yeah,<br>
   they didn't like it. Some of my friends, they like it, but my family, my<br>
   parents, they're like super Mexican. [Chuckles]. They don't really used to<br>
   a different type. They give you beans, tortillas, and pork meat, and beef<br>
   meat. They're happy with it.<br>

  </span> Lizzy: How did they treat you there?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Not bad, but they always intimidating, like trying to ... It's like</br>   you are in jail, I guess. They don't want anyone to feel that they can make</br>   whatever they want with them, or trying to intimidate the [inaudible], or</br>   any other type of misconduct, I would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, misconduct.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, it's just hard. It’s undescribable.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What was the food like?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's just gross. The portions are none literally. Sometimes they give</br>   you rotten milk—just little boxes, like little milk boxes, like a little</br>   carton thing. Yeah, so sometimes there's hair in the food. Sometimes it's</br>   just the portions, literally, they just like shoved in like a half of a</br>   spoon, just throw it in there. What else besides the hair..?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You were hungry a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah there was a lot of hunger in there. You can't save food either.</br>   Cause I remember we used to save the peanut butter sandwich to keep it for</br>   later on, for late night, so we wouldn't get hungry. They would search you</br>   so if they found you everything that's ... They will penalize you, either</br>   with the hole and everything, or twenty-four hours locked in. It's kind of</br>   hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Big punishment just for trying to save food for later?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. Well... [Chuckles]. You're in there, you can't do anything.</br>   You're just one more number and one more inmate.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Were any of your family members or friends able to come visit you</br>   while you were in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. I was just by myself.

I didn't really want to call them,</br>   because they say [inaudible] They were never going to support me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They wouldn't support you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Can you tell me more about that? They wouldn't support you in terms</br>   of that they would be upset with you, or just that they wouldn't help you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I think they would help me, but they would be disappointed of me.</br>   They'd say, “Why you do this?” or something like that. I rather not to call</br>   them or tell them about...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't know that you were detained?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, they didn't know.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When did they find out?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: When I got deported. [Chuckles]. When I got deported, I got released</br>   on… What's it called? Nuevo Laredo, it's like the Texas border. I got</br>   released over there, and then I called my brother because he owes me money.</br>   I called him just to tell him I'm here in Nuevo Laredo. Send me some money</br>   because I got to come home. [Chuckles]. Well, yeah, that's how they found</br>   out I got deported. I'm pretty sure they would’ve helped me; they gave me</br>   some money. But after that, no. That's when I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you remember what it was like that day crossing the bridge from</br>   Texas back into Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. I will never forget that. They just gave you this small bag with</br>   your belongs, [Chuckles] which is like clothes from jail, so they're not</br>   really good. They give you small needs, like a bag with needs, with</br>   everything. They just release you. They take all the chains off. They're</br>   just like, “Get off the bus, walk across the bridge.” That's it. Well, you</br>   had to cross it. [Chuckle]. What other choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did you do when you were across the bridge?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was a little scared, a little excited about a new thing, but I was</br>   just thinking too much—like I don't have money, where am I going to go?</br>   What I going to do? There was a lot of rumors about the cartels recruiting</br>   immigrants as soon as you cross the bridge; they going to make you get into</br>   a car, and they going to take you from there. If you with them or not, they</br>   going to kill you. I was just looking around like, “Where's the car?</br>   Where's the car?” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you have any experience like that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, not really. Luckily, I got welcomed by this group of people—the</br>   one I mentioned. They literally just went, “Okay, where are you going?” I'm</br>   like, “Oh, I'm going to Guerrero.” “Okay, so listen. We are from the</br>   Mexican government. We here to assist you and help with everything that you</br>   might need.” I was like, “Okay.” “Just come with us.” it was a little scary</br>   because they say, “Okay, just come with us,” and they just take you around</br>   the building. You don't even know, what other choice do you have? You</br>   either stay with them or just stay in the street?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And you're not sure whether it's safe to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: No other choice?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They say they from the government and they have a little logo, a</br>   Mexico logo, so I was like, “Okay. I'm going to just go with them. Whatever</br>   happens is going to happen.” They give you access to computers to</br>   communicate with your family and everything. That's when I got in contact</br>   with my brother. I was just like, “Send me some money here. I'm going to</br>   need for my bus ride at least.” Then one of the guys heard me: “Hey, where</br>   did you say you were from?” I'm like, “I'm from Guerrero.” “Oh, Guerrero, I</br>   think Guerrero have some programs about immigrants from their state. It’s</br>   their people, and they take care of them.” Yeah, if you're an immigrant</br>   from my state like Guerrero, and you were born there, they will pay you. If</br>   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,</br>   and not even five minutes, they will be answering you with the</br>   approve—well, the bus will have to take you to Guerrero.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To take you to Guerrero?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It was nice, I was like, “Okay.” I just told my brother to send me</br>   money to Guerrero. I get to my house. That was it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did that feel like being back in your home?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: [Exhale]. It was just awful. As I say, nobody knew me. I didn't know</br>   nobody besides my family, my close friends and family, close family.</br>   Besides my neighbors, they didn't know who I was. I didn't know who they</br>   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids</br>   five years old, they were almost twenty-five by then. I was like, “No.” It</br>   was exciting getting to know more people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you feel like you were returning home, or did you feel like an</br>   outsider?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I felt like an outsider. Yeah, definitely an outsider. Well,</br>   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.</br>   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you</br>   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or</br>   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just</br>   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I</br>   was like, “No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How long did you stay there before you came to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About one year. I've been living one year here. I've been jumping job</br>   by job. Some jobs did not accept me because I don’t have the high school</br>   diploma—that's why I'm trying to get it. Luckily, T-Tech they accept you.</br>   They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As</br>   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you like working at T-Tech?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I've only been working there for two weeks, but I think I'm going to</br>   like a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What do you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to</br>   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high</br>   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There’s no…</br>   a lot of people speak English better than me, like, “Go eff yourself.”</br> </br> </br>   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs</br>   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't</br>   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the</br>   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for three months. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is</br>   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,</br>   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for</br>   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of</br>   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I</br>   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the</br>   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.</br>   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went</br>   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the</br>   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying</br>   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to</br>   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you</br>   guys thinking about?”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like you had a different work ethic than your coworkers</br>   there. Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the U.S.</br>   culture, I guess? In the U.S., you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and</br>   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I</br>   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really</br>   ask for rewards and everything. I remember one time, a lady—a messy girl</br>   from the streets, I think she was homeless—she showed up at the restaurant,</br>   and was like, “Hey, is this yours?” It was my wallet. I was like, “Yeah.</br>   Where you found it?” “Here. There's a lot of money in there, so take care</br>   of it.” I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was</br>   like, “Hey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you</br>   want.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: She was like, “Oh no no, I got to go. I got to go.” I was like, “You</br>   sure? Come on, let me cook something for you. You can have it for later.</br>   You can have it for to go. “No no, no, thank you, thank you, thank you.”</br>   She just left. I was like, “Wow.” And here, I already lost my wallet once.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Nobody returned it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I ain't got no call. I got nothing. I got nothing for it. That's what</br>   I hate about this.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had mentioned in the survey you got attacked and your belongings</br>   stolen. Can you tell me about that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Oh yeah. I was hanging out with my friend. She's a girl, short girl,</br>   and I didn't really know. Those guys, they came to us with the knives. They</br>   pull out the knives. They came to me, they put a knife on my neck, and</br>   another one in my stomach, like say, “Don't move, don't move.” But as they</br>   say that, I didn't show that I was afraid of them. I was just like, “Okay,</br>   calm down. Take whatever you want. Don't do anything stupid, something like</br>   that.” I didn't want to do anything—hit back or something and run</br>   away—because I was with the girl. I was just more scared about her. She was</br>   super scared. I was like, “Just take that, just go.” Yeah, after that,</br>   there was a police station two blocks from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you go to the police?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, we went to the police. She filed a report and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did they do? Nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Nothing. Nothing at all. I don't think she got contacted or something,</br>   and I don't think they did something. It's just like a regular thing around</br>   here. You get jacked and they steal your stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had said that you don't feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. To be honest, I don't feel safe. I'm always on guard, like</br>   everything. When I see people, as long as I’m by myself, and I see people</br>   getting close to me, I'm going to get just on guard. I see something you're</br>   trying to do to me, I'm just going to scream and run. [Chuckle]. I don't</br>   feel safe. I’m always aware. When I'm on the subway, on the streets, I'm</br>   always checking my pockets around, “Oh, I still have my wallet, still have</br>   my ... “ It's just a daily thing, I have to check everything. When I get</br>   out and get into the bus, I have to check my wallet. I get out, I check my</br>   wallet and everything. If you drop anything, somebody take it, you're never</br>   going to see that item again.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like it's a stress that's always—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, yeah. Have to be aware, have to be aware, have to be aware!</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you ever feel like that in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all. Never. I used to go to ___ in the morning, Chinatown,</br>   by myself. Nothing ever happened. It's just definitely a different world, I</br>   would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Different world here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Different people as well. People here is just—I know there's good</br>   people, but it's just, I hate some people really. They super selfish, they</br>   only worry about them. They don't give a damn about anybody else. What can</br>   they do to hurt the other people? For them, it's just them, them, them,</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think that there's people like that here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: One example from the subway, there's a lot of people that they don't</br>   care about the others. I always tell it to my friends when I get to speak</br>   about the city that when I came here, I was giving seats to the ladies, to</br>   the girls. “Hey, take a seat and everything.” The people get crowded at the</br>   door when the subway open the door, they just get crowded. Everybody wants</br>   to get in. I was like, for real, just stepping aside, just trying to let</br>   them go, and then I get in. Now? Nah. They crowd in, I go too. I have to be</br>   like, “I don't give a damn about you.” There are ladies forties, maybe</br>   fifties, they're nice, but I'm not giving my chair. Only if I see a really</br>   elderly lady, “Okay, just take a seat there.” That makes a big change on</br>   you and how you were raised. It's a lot of, the city takes a lot from you:</br>   take your manners, take your... If you're kind to people, get ready,</br>   because this city is going to change you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You feel like it's changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. For real. I feel like it's taking the manners from you. What</br>   else? Kindness. The people ask you for money and everything. They're just</br>   crazy. There's a guy in good working condition, just like, “Hey, give me</br>   some money.” Get out of my face, get the fuck out of my face, because I</br>   can't stand those people. In good, working condition, they can have a job.</br>   I got this in my mind, if you in that condition, a homeless condition, it’s</br>   because you wanted to. You have two hands, two feet, I don't see that you</br>   suffer sickness or something like that, that will not allow you to work or</br>   to have a job. There's a lot of work around here. There's work everywhere.</br>   You just have to want to work first. That makes me mad a lot. Get out of</br>   here, get out of my face, because I can't stand them. I can't stand the</br>   people. I can’t stand that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's been the biggest challenge for you? What's been hardest for</br>   you being back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: The biggest challenge I would say is to adapt and to accept people the</br>   way they are because obviously they're not in the US. It's hard for me to</br>   accept, to ignore them, to see if someone has stolen something, is not</br>   doing things right. It's hard to me to keep quiet. So, to adapt and to</br>   accept these people. That's really hard. Sometimes I just feel like I want</br>   to scream at people and yell at them. Just, “Get a job, just do something</br>   for your life.” It's like, “Do a job. Everybody's getting a job. Why are</br>   you jacking off? Why are you just jacking people on the streets or trying</br>   to defraud and make fraud everywhere? Just get a job or something.” That</br>   makes me mad, because I have a job. I'm paying taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, you work hard.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, why you not? For real? I work hard and I pay taxes, so we have a</br>   decent city. You just wake up, go to the bus, and ask for money? That's it?</br>   That makes me mad, for real.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you think that for some people, they're not able to get a job</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I bet there's some people that are not able to get a job, but there's</br>   a small fraction. Super, super, super small fraction. Let's say, for every</br>   hundred people, at least only two of the people there really are disabled,</br>   not able to get a job. The rest, they just don't want to get a job. For</br>   example, those immigrants that came from Honduras. A couple of them, they</br>   get into the bus, they say, “Just give me money. I don't have any</br>   paperwork.” Dude, you don't need a paperwork. There's a food stand that is</br>   asking for a server or something. You just fill out an application and ask</br>   them for a job. Explain the situation. You say you really need a job, and</br>   you want to work, they're not going to reject you. They're not going to let</br>   you in the streets. And that’s the reason that they're asking for money</br>   like that. Just get out. Get out of here. I'm not going to give you my</br>   money. I'm giving you money to [inaudible 00:31:53] you can have a life,</br>   you can have all type of programs. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I might be a dick</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's okay. I like honesty. I would rather have an honest answer.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. That's me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What about, to switch over to a positive note to end on, what's been</br>   the most positive thing for you, or what's been the best part of being back</br>   in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="e691f114-8ae5-46da-b82b-16ace9663f8b" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Best parts aboutbeing back">Noe: Hmm. Getting to know more about my culture. That's one thing. I've<br>
   been reading a lot of books about Mexico. Not the culture right now, but<br>
   the culture of Mexico, Hispanic Mexico. Visiting the temples, to<br>
   Teotihuacan, have you been there? Those are not, they're pyramids, but it's<br>
   called temples. The temples, there's a lot of things. For example, there's<br>

The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for three months. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="1bc9695c-f169-483d-a9d3-190b4a10c4ff" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Discrimination/stigmatization">Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is<br>
   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,<br>
   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for<br>
   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of<br>
   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I<br>
   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the<br>
   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.<br>
   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went<br>
   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the<br>
   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying<br>
   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to<br>
   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you<br>
   guys thinking about?”<br>

   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.<br>
   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you<br>
   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or<br>
   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just<br>

   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids<br>

   communicate with your family and everything. That's when I got in contact<br>
   with my brother. I was just like, “Send me some money here. I'm going to<br>
   need for my bus ride at least.” Then one of the guys heard me: “Hey, where<br>
   did you say you were from?” I'm like, “I'm from Guerrero.” “Oh, Guerrero, I<br>
   think Guerrero have some programs about immigrants from their state. It’s<br>
   their people, and they take care of them.” Yeah, if you're an immigrant<br>
   from my state like Guerrero, and you were born there, they will pay you. If<br>
   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,<br>
   and not even five minutes, they will be answering you with the<br>

I didn't really want to call them,</br>   because they say [inaudible] They were never going to support me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They wouldn't support you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Can you tell me more about that? They wouldn't support you in terms</br>   of that they would be upset with you, or just that they wouldn't help you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I think they would help me, but they would be disappointed of me.</br>   They'd say, “Why you do this?” or something like that. I rather not to call</br>   them or tell them about...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't know that you were detained?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, they didn't know.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When did they find out?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: When I got deported. [Chuckles]. When I got deported, I got released</br>   on… What's it called? Nuevo Laredo, it's like the Texas border. I got</br>   released over there, and then I called my brother because he owes me money.</br>   I called him just to tell him I'm here in Nuevo Laredo. Send me some money</br>   because I got to come home. [Chuckles]. Well, yeah, that's how they found</br>   out I got deported. I'm pretty sure they would’ve helped me; they gave me</br>   some money. But after that, no. That's when I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you remember what it was like that day crossing the bridge from</br>   Texas back into Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. I will never forget that. They just gave you this small bag with</br>   your belongs, [Chuckles] which is like clothes from jail, so they're not</br>   really good. They give you small needs, like a bag with needs, with</br>   everything. They just release you. They take all the chains off. They're</br>   just like, “Get off the bus, walk across the bridge.” That's it. Well, you</br>   had to cross it. [Chuckle]. What other choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did you do when you were across the bridge?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I was a little scared, a little excited about a new thing, but I was</br>   just thinking too much—like I don't have money, where am I going to go?</br>   What I going to do? There was a lot of rumors about the cartels recruiting</br>   immigrants as soon as you cross the bridge; they going to make you get into</br>   a car, and they going to take you from there. If you with them or not, they</br>   going to kill you. I was just looking around like, “Where's the car?</br>   Where's the car?” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you have any experience like that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No, not really. Luckily, I got welcomed by this group of people—the</br>   one I mentioned. They literally just went, “Okay, where are you going?” I'm</br>   like, “Oh, I'm going to Guerrero.” “Okay, so listen. We are from the</br>   Mexican government. We here to assist you and help with everything that you</br>   might need.” I was like, “Okay.” “Just come with us.” it was a little scary</br>   because they say, “Okay, just come with us,” and they just take you around</br>   the building. You don't even know, what other choice do you have? You</br>   either stay with them or just stay in the street?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And you're not sure whether it's safe to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: No other choice?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They say they from the government and they have a little logo, a</br>   Mexico logo, so I was like, “Okay. I'm going to just go with them. Whatever</br>   happens is going to happen.” They give you access to computers to</br>   communicate with your family and everything. That's when I got in contact</br>   with my brother. I was just like, “Send me some money here. I'm going to</br>   need for my bus ride at least.” Then one of the guys heard me: “Hey, where</br>   did you say you were from?” I'm like, “I'm from Guerrero.” “Oh, Guerrero, I</br>   think Guerrero have some programs about immigrants from their state. It’s</br>   their people, and they take care of them.” Yeah, if you're an immigrant</br>   from my state like Guerrero, and you were born there, they will pay you. If</br>   you get deported, they will pay you the trip. You submit an application,</br>   and not even five minutes, they will be answering you with the</br>   approve—well, the bus will have to take you to Guerrero.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To take you to Guerrero?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It was nice, I was like, “Okay.” I just told my brother to send me</br>   money to Guerrero. I get to my house. That was it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did that feel like being back in your home?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: [Exhale]. It was just awful. As I say, nobody knew me. I didn't know</br>   nobody besides my family, my close friends and family, close family.</br>   Besides my neighbors, they didn't know who I was. I didn't know who they</br>   were—well yeah, the old people, but not, for example, if there was kids</br>   five years old, they were almost twenty-five by then. I was like, “No.” It</br>   was exciting getting to know more people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you feel like you were returning home, or did you feel like an</br>   outsider?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I felt like an outsider. Yeah, definitely an outsider. Well,</br>   literally, you don't know what to do there. You don't know how they are.</br>   Even you if try to adapt to the living in there, it's hard. They'll see you</br>   and they'll just reject you, because “Oh, you didn't have an answer,” or</br>   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just</br>   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I</br>   was like, “No, I'm not staying here.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How long did you stay there before you came to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About one year. I've been living one year here. I've been jumping job</br>   by job. Some jobs did not accept me because I don’t have the high school</br>   diploma—that's why I'm trying to get it. Luckily, T-Tech they accept you.</br>   They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As</br>   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you like working at T-Tech?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I've only been working there for two weeks, but I think I'm going to</br>   like a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What do you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to</br>   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high</br>   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There’s no…</br>   a lot of people speak English better than me, like, “Go eff yourself.”</br> </br> </br>   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs</br>   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't</br>   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the</br>   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they</br>   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with</br>   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white</br>   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're</br>   white—that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are</br>   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to</br>   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or</br>   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that</br>   for them, they was just complaining about me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They got mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, “Well okay now guys, eff</br>   you, I'm not helping you anymore.” I only stayed there for three months. I</br>   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I</br>   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you</br>   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make</br>   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I</br>   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, “Hey, you</br>   have to say like this, not say like that,” or something like that, trying</br>   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,</br>   “If you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm</br>   here for you guys to help you out.” They didn't take it like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: They didn't want help?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is</br>   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,</br>   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, “I'm not like that, guys, for</br>   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of</br>   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I</br>   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the</br>   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.</br>   I'm not taking that.” Also, there's quite a few situations that I went</br>   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the</br>   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying</br>   to think what to do. You don’t have to deal with it, you have to return to</br>   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It’s like, “What are you</br>   guys thinking about?”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like you had a different work ethic than your coworkers</br>   there. Why do you think that is?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the U.S.</br>   culture, I guess? In the U.S., you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and</br>   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I</br>   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really</br>   ask for rewards and everything. I remember one time, a lady—a messy girl</br>   from the streets, I think she was homeless—she showed up at the restaurant,</br>   and was like, “Hey, is this yours?” It was my wallet. I was like, “Yeah.</br>   Where you found it?” “Here. There's a lot of money in there, so take care</br>   of it.” I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was</br>   like, “Hey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you</br>   want.”</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: She was like, “Oh no no, I got to go. I got to go.” I was like, “You</br>   sure? Come on, let me cook something for you. You can have it for later.</br>   You can have it for to go. “No no, no, thank you, thank you, thank you.”</br>   She just left. I was like, “Wow.” And here, I already lost my wallet once.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Nobody returned it?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I ain't got no call. I got nothing. I got nothing for it. That's what</br>   I hate about this.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had mentioned in the survey you got attacked and your belongings</br>   stolen. Can you tell me about that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Oh yeah. I was hanging out with my friend. She's a girl, short girl,</br>   and I didn't really know. Those guys, they came to us with the knives. They</br>   pull out the knives. They came to me, they put a knife on my neck, and</br>   another one in my stomach, like say, “Don't move, don't move.” But as they</br>   say that, I didn't show that I was afraid of them. I was just like, “Okay,</br>   calm down. Take whatever you want. Don't do anything stupid, something like</br>   that.” I didn't want to do anything—hit back or something and run</br>   away—because I was with the girl. I was just more scared about her. She was</br>   super scared. I was like, “Just take that, just go.” Yeah, after that,</br>   there was a police station two blocks from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you go to the police?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, we went to the police. She filed a report and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What did they do? Nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Nothing. Nothing at all. I don't think she got contacted or something,</br>   and I don't think they did something. It's just like a regular thing around</br>   here. You get jacked and they steal your stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You had said that you don't feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. To be honest, I don't feel safe. I'm always on guard, like</br>   everything. When I see people, as long as I’m by myself, and I see people</br>   getting close to me, I'm going to get just on guard. I see something you're</br>   trying to do to me, I'm just going to scream and run. [Chuckle]. I don't</br>   feel safe. I’m always aware. When I'm on the subway, on the streets, I'm</br>   always checking my pockets around, “Oh, I still have my wallet, still have</br>   my ... “ It's just a daily thing, I have to check everything. When I get</br>   out and get into the bus, I have to check my wallet. I get out, I check my</br>   wallet and everything. If you drop anything, somebody take it, you're never</br>   going to see that item again.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Sounds like it's a stress that's always—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, yeah. Have to be aware, have to be aware, have to be aware!</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you ever feel like that in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all. Never. I used to go to ___ in the morning, Chinatown,</br>   by myself. Nothing ever happened. It's just definitely a different world, I</br>   would say.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Different world here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Different people as well. People here is just—I know there's good</br>   people, but it's just, I hate some people really. They super selfish, they</br>   only worry about them. They don't give a damn about anybody else. What can</br>   they do to hurt the other people? For them, it's just them, them, them,</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why do you think that there's people like that here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: One example from the subway, there's a lot of people that they don't</br>   care about the others. I always tell it to my friends when I get to speak</br>   about the city that when I came here, I was giving seats to the ladies, to</br>   the girls. “Hey, take a seat and everything.” The people get crowded at the</br>   door when the subway open the door, they just get crowded. Everybody wants</br>   to get in. I was like, for real, just stepping aside, just trying to let</br>   them go, and then I get in. Now? Nah. They crowd in, I go too. I have to be</br>   like, “I don't give a damn about you.” There are ladies forties, maybe</br>   fifties, they're nice, but I'm not giving my chair. Only if I see a really</br>   elderly lady, “Okay, just take a seat there.” That makes a big change on</br>   you and how you were raised. It's a lot of, the city takes a lot from you:</br>   take your manners, take your... If you're kind to people, get ready,</br>   because this city is going to change you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You feel like it's changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. For real. I feel like it's taking the manners from you. What</br>   else? Kindness. The people ask you for money and everything. They're just</br>   crazy. There's a guy in good working condition, just like, “Hey, give me</br>   some money.” Get out of my face, get the fuck out of my face, because I</br>   can't stand those people. In good, working condition, they can have a job.</br>   I got this in my mind, if you in that condition, a homeless condition, it’s</br>   because you wanted to. You have two hands, two feet, I don't see that you</br>   suffer sickness or something like that, that will not allow you to work or</br>   to have a job. There's a lot of work around here. There's work everywhere.</br>   You just have to want to work first. That makes me mad a lot. Get out of</br>   here, get out of my face, because I can't stand them. I can't stand the</br>   people. I can’t stand that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's been the biggest challenge for you? What's been hardest for</br>   you being back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: The biggest challenge I would say is to adapt and to accept people the</br>   way they are because obviously they're not in the US. It's hard for me to</br>   accept, to ignore them, to see if someone has stolen something, is not</br>   doing things right. It's hard to me to keep quiet. So, to adapt and to</br>   accept these people. That's really hard. Sometimes I just feel like I want</br>   to scream at people and yell at them. Just, “Get a job, just do something</br>   for your life.” It's like, “Do a job. Everybody's getting a job. Why are</br>   you jacking off? Why are you just jacking people on the streets or trying</br>   to defraud and make fraud everywhere? Just get a job or something.” That</br>   makes me mad, because I have a job. I'm paying taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, you work hard.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, why you not? For real? I work hard and I pay taxes, so we have a</br>   decent city. You just wake up, go to the bus, and ask for money? That's it?</br>   That makes me mad, for real.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you think that for some people, they're not able to get a job</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: I bet there's some people that are not able to get a job, but there's</br>   a small fraction. Super, super, super small fraction. Let's say, for every</br>   hundred people, at least only two of the people there really are disabled,</br>   not able to get a job. The rest, they just don't want to get a job. For</br>   example, those immigrants that came from Honduras. A couple of them, they</br>   get into the bus, they say, “Just give me money. I don't have any</br>   paperwork.” Dude, you don't need a paperwork. There's a food stand that is</br>   asking for a server or something. You just fill out an application and ask</br>   them for a job. Explain the situation. You say you really need a job, and</br>   you want to work, they're not going to reject you. They're not going to let</br>   you in the streets. And that’s the reason that they're asking for money</br>   like that. Just get out. Get out of here. I'm not going to give you my</br>   money. I'm giving you money to [inaudible 00:31:53] you can have a life,</br>   you can have all type of programs. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I might be a dick</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's okay. I like honesty. I would rather have an honest answer.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. That's me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What about, to switch over to a positive note to end on, what's been</br>   the most positive thing for you, or what's been the best part of being back</br>   in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Hmm. Getting to know more about my culture. That's one thing. I've</br>   been reading a lot of books about Mexico. Not the culture right now, but</br>   the culture of Mexico, Hispanic Mexico. Visiting the temples, to</br>   Teotihuacan, have you been there? Those are not, they're pyramids, but it's</br>   called temples. The temples, there's a lot of things. For example, there's</br>   a lot of history on my little village that used to be home of the Aztecs.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: The what?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Aztecs.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Oh okay, yes. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Cuauhtemoc, a big icon about the Aztec. Cuauhtemoc, they used to live</br>   there. There's a lot of finds that have been happening around the village.</br>   Whenever I go, when I have a chance, I go up there, and just explore the</br>   caves. I've been finding paintings, prehistoric paintings. There's a lot of</br>   culture that I've been seeing that I like. That's one thing, that I'm</br>   getting to know more of my country. Well, my family. I get to see my family</br>   more often. If I stay in the US, I will never come, like, “Ah, it's</br>   Mexico.” [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When you lived in the US, were you ever able to visit Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: No. Not at all, due to my immigration status. It's like everything.</br>   The U.S.A. just swallow you into the system. And it's fine. It's working.</br>   The thing that you not able to leave the country, you get used to it, like,</br>   “Oh, it's just Mexico.” I was just playing. To be honest, I would never</br>   come back. I would never come back if I wouldn't have deported, so that's</br>   one positive thing about the deportation. I got to know my country, my</br>   culture. Got to spend more time with my family. If it wouldn’t have been</br>   like that, I would never have come to Mexico. Yeah, I think all the people</br>   that leave Mexico and emigrate to the US, we do the same thing. “Okay, next</br>   year, I'm going to go to Mexico.” The year goes by, and the year go by.</br>   “Okay, in two years, I'm going to try to save my money and I'm going to</br>   Mexico.” The two years go by, and it just goes by, goes by, it goes by, it</br>   goes by. It's just like that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It would be very difficult, because you would have to—</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Cross the border again. Well, you know that things are getting more</br>   hard on the border. There's a lot of chances that you might not make it.</br>   Obviously, the cartels, they took over the border already. Either you pay a</br>   lot of money or you're a mule or they just not let you in. They'll kill</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What are your hopes for your future now back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's to get a better job. I know call centers, they pay pretty well,</br>   more than on the street or working in construction, but my plan right now</br>   is to get on track in my studies, get my GED, get to university, get some</br>   career. Well, to get a career as quick as possible because I'm not speaking</br>   about ten years from now or five years from now, I'm speaking—well maybe</br>   five years. Ten years is too much. I'm trying to hurry up as quick as</br>   possible and get a job.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you want to be a chef again, or something else?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. It's going to be something else, but food has always been my</br>   passion. I'm planning to get my diploma on PMP. You know what PMP is?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What's that?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: It's like a programming managing, it's computers, technology. After</br>   that, I'm planning to open my own restaurant. Start from the bottom,</br>   obviously, and open a small restaurant to see how it goes from there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Japanese.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Japanese food?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah. One of my plans is to go to the US because I have ten years</br>   deportation, so after ten years I'll see what I can do to that. Hopefully</br>   by then I'll have my restaurant at full potential and to get some chains to</br>   the U.S., maybe South America. Canada is one of my targets as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To live?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: To live as well, Canada. Well for business as well. Have U.S. and</br>   Canada for business.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Opening up restaurants?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Opening restaurant. Small restaurants, to make a chain—not so</br>   expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: What kind of Japanese food do you like to cook?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Well, I just go from stir fry into fried, like tempura things, sushi</br>   rolls. There's a million sushi rolls that I can make. Mostly typical more</br>   homemade Japanese food—let's say like ramens, house ramens, and everything.</br>   Some products from Japan, like specifically like a, how I say? Those</br>   products that you can't get anywhere except Japan, so I'm trying to do that</br>   as well. That's one of my priorities as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Why Japan?</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Because I like their culture. I've been raised with Japanese people as</br>   well, and well I specialize. Out of the ten years of the kitchen, seven</br>   years they were only for Japanese food. I know Italian, Chinese, Korean,</br>   but Japanese is the one that captured my attention. All the rolls and</br>   everything, the flavors. I know here, their palette, the Mexican people,</br>   their taste, they are not really like aware of flavors. I'm working on it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: You can teach them how to like it.</br> </br> </br>   Noe: Yeah, one example, when I first got into my village, I make a shrimp</br>   fried rice with fruit spring rolls. They only ate the spring rolls. They</br>   didn't like the fried rice with the shrimp. They’re like, “This is the best</br>   thing that you gave me?” There is a big pot, maybe three pounds, three</br>   pounds of rice. It was decent. “No, I don't like the rice, because it's</br>   just rice.” “Eat it with the chopsticks, I don't think you guys can use it,</br>   so use a fork.” They're like, “No, I don't want to eat just rice.” “Why?”</br>   “Because I'm not a chicken.” I'm like, “Just eat it.” And now they're</br>   saying, “Oh it just tastes like garlic.” “That's what fried rice tastes</br>   like! Okay, fuck it! Just leave it, I'll just eat it all by myself.” Yeah,</br>   they didn't like it. Some of my friends, they like it, but my family, my</br>   parents, they're like super Mexican. [Chuckles]. They don't really used to</br>   a different type. They give you beans, tortillas, and pork meat, and beef</br>   meat. They're happy with it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Well, hopefully one day, if you have a Japanese restaurant, they'll</br>   come eat there and learn all about the food.</br> </div><\p></p>
