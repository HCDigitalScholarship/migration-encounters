   we were illegal so we took that another step and we said, &quot;Yes. Yes, we<br>
   are. We are illegal aliens. We are, but we're also Americans. We share the<br>
   same traditions, we celebrate Thanksgiving, we celebrate the 4th of July.&quot;<br>
   We had to be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the<br>
   Americans. That's how it started.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Let me ask you a question about that because I've thought about that in the</br>   past year or so of this work. That everybody who we talk to in your</br>   situation, describes themselves as being illegal. And ee who consider</br>   ourselves pro-migrant, et cetera, we use all these other words. Right?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Right.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   We don't say illegal. We say, &quot;undocumented,&quot; or, &quot;unauthorized,&quot; or</br>   whatever. Why do you guys describe yourselves as illegal? Why do we</br>   describe you -- we jump through all this stuff. How does that sound to you?</br>   It's something I've been thinking about.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess it's the-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You're literally wearing it on your sleeve.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I live it. I guess this is the street slang. We always use different</br>   vocabulary than the ones they use just to be different, I guess. We have</br>   our own lingo. We definitely want to represent. It's not like we're hiding</br>   or anything, but we want to also express ourselves to our full potential. I</br>   think that's one of the best ways. I got into the hip hop culture as a very</br>   young child, so I knew that there was graffiti, there was music, there was</br>   rapping, there was break dancing. We took that, and we placed our own</br>   little bits of ourselves into it. I guess that's where it comes from. I've</br>   heard immigrant. In school, I remember in elementary school, we were, there</br>   was a class called ESL.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They would call us migrant students. And I didn't understand what it was</br>   until I grew older and started looking at the vocabulary. I saw that it</br>   could be you know, an alien. I said, &quot;Yes, we are aliens. We're from a</br>   different planet called Mexico.&quot; I guess that's how it started and just</br>   people picking on us that we're illegal, &quot;Go back to your country,&quot; and</br>   things like that. We definitely wanted to make that statement. Like, &quot;Yes,</br>   we are illegal. So what?&quot; That's how it started.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   A couple things with that. You said that you didn't know that you were</br>   illegal, though.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When did you discover that you weren't? Did you have American friends?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes, of course. My grandfather was originally born in Texas. He came to</br>   Mexico when he was only seven years old. I didn't know I was illegal</br>   because I thought that my family had moved to a different part of the</br>   planet. I didn't think it was a bad thing. Of course, you see in the news,</br>   you start seeing people getting deported. I didn't understand it, but I</br>   somehow thought I was. I never asked my parents about it. We never really</br>   spoke about it. All my friends, of course, they were American. My neighbors</br>   were American. I guess in high school, maybe that's when it started up. I</br>   started investigating because there was, how do you call it, marchas?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Protests.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Protests. I would see on TV students stepping out. I said, &quot;Hey, I think I</br>   should be doing that. I'm not sure.&quot; Then once I just got pulled over and I</br>   said, &quot;Oh, I'm American. I've been here my whole life. I have my</br>   documents.&quot; They actually told me, &quot;Well, you're right about some things,</br>   but wrong about different things. Yes, you have been here your whole life,</br>   but you didn't cross legally into the States. That's why” I said, &quot;Oh,</br>   okay. So, we are illegal.&quot; That's when I confirmed it, I guess. In the back</br>   of my mind, I thought I was, but I never actually officially heard it or</br>   knew about it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then after high school, when I got pulled over, they brought me to county</br>   and took me to prison. I said, &quot;Okay, so it's real. I am illegal.&quot; Then</br>   after I fought my case and I came back out, that's when I really started to</br>   say, &quot;Okay, yes, I am illegal. I am undocumented and I need to do something</br>   about it.&quot; I guess back then the easiest way was to get married with</br>   someone and they could fix you up. But I was 18 years old. I said, &quot;No, I'd</br>   rather go back to Mexico.&quot; At the same time, I wanted to learn about my</br>   culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   When they pulled you over, what did they pull you over for?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was like a checkup. It was a checkpoint.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   A checkpoint.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. It was just a checkpoint. That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did they treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess that first police officer, he was normal about it. He was like,</br>   &quot;I'm just doing my job. You have to go here.&quot; Then once I got actually</br>   arrested, that's when things changed because they treated me like if I were</br>   an animal, or if I had done something really wrong. It wasn't the case. I</br>   did get in trouble like any normal kid. I don't know, maybe breaking</br>   something or with other guys playing in the street or fighting or things</br>   like that, but I don't know. I guess after I got arrested, and they put the</br>   handcuffs on me, that's when they started treating me like if I were a</br>   criminal. I said, &quot;Why? I didn't do anything. I was only seven years old</br>   when I crossed.&quot; But I thought I crossed like everybody does. I guess it</br>   was after I got arrested that I started seeing the real discrimination with</br>   the authorities. In school, maybe just a typical guy that says, &quot;Hey, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; I would fight back saying, &quot;Hey, you don't either</br>   because your ancestors are not even from America.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you say, &quot;My dad was born in Texas,&quot; My grandpa?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't know then until I came back to Mexico. I don't know. I don't think</br>   my parents were trying to hide that. I think they were just trying to live,</br>   to continue living. I found out a lot of things when I came back to Mexico.</br>   Yeah, it was hard at first. I think I am actually happy that I haven't,</br>   otherwise I wouldn't be the person that I am now. That's how it was.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But were you a member of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I knew people. The area where I lived there was all kinds of gangs. I did</br>   get affiliated. I didn't want to, but I guess I couldn't for some reason,</br>   or I did go out and hang out with them. I did do a lot of things that they</br>   did, but I never considered myself part of it. I thought I was just</br>   affiliated. I thought it was normal because everybody was doing it. Not</br>   only in my city but in other cities. I saw the TV, so I thought it was just</br>   something normal that teenagers went through and eventually they get back</br>   on track. I thought it was just part of being a teenager. I didn't really</br>   think I was, &quot;Oh, I want to be the biggest gang member in the world.&quot; I</br>   just thought, &quot;Oh, yeah, it's cool.&quot; I did want to be part of something,</br>   obviously. I didn't want to feel left out. I did have family members that</br>   did represent them more than that. I thought it was just normal.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I lived in Arkansas, so I remember a lot of people from California started</br>   coming in. A lot of people from Chicago started coming in. So, There was</br>   like a lot of activities going on. I just thought it was part of just being</br>   a normal teenager because including my, I don't want to discriminate, but</br>   my white friends, they were going through other things as well, so I was</br>   like, &quot;Oh, it's just this normal thing.&quot; My black friends, they were doing</br>   similar things, so I didn't think it was only Mexicans. I thought it was</br>   just in general.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What were your white friends and black friends doing that was the</br>   equivalent?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Well, graffiti. We used to love writing on the walls. Or, I don't know,</br>   smoking marijuana. Things like that. Not like damaging or killing people,</br>   nothing like that. But more like the lighter stuff. Especially my white</br>   friends, they were the ones that really had the marijuana. We didn't know</br>   where to get that. My black friends, well they were more into the hip hop</br>   and graffiti culture. So, I thought that was pretty cool, and I would go in</br>   the library and started just searching books about it. I said, &quot;Okay, it's</br>   normal.&quot; There were like what you call crews, depending on which area that</br>   you lived. For example, this is the Centro so all the little kids from the</br>   Centro would hang out and they would go compete with the people from uptown</br>   and things like that. I guess that was just it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then eventually it got more into music. Instead of fighting each other we</br>   would like rap and insult each other but in a more clever way. At the end</br>   of the day, &quot;Okay, you did good. I like what you said about them,&quot; or &quot;I</br>   like what you said about this.&quot; It's just part of the culture for me to</br>   grow like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Let me go back and then if you could talk a little bit more about the</br>   experience in detention, that would be important for us to know about it.</br>   When you grew up, did you see a lot of your parents? Were they working all</br>   the time? What was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess I grew up more with my grandma because she would go and come back.</br>   During summer, I would stay with my grandma more. Yeah, I did see my father</br>   a lot. Mostly my father. My mom was the one that was more time at her job</br>   because she became a supervisor of a company, so she had to be there most</br>   of the time. My father was just a construction worker so after a certain</br>   time, he can't work anymore because of the light. I grew up with my father</br>   a lot. My sister and I, he would take us to the park, take us swimming. I</br>   don't feel like I missed them too much. I always felt that we were a</br>   family. No, I don't think I got that experience. I do know of other friends</br>   that their parents were at work all day and he was by himself at the house.</br>   I was like, &quot;Hey, just come over here. You can come play at my house.&quot; We</br>   had a trampoline and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you celebrated both American and Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Well, January 6 is the Dia de los Santos Reyes Magos, so of course I wanted</br>   my toys. Then fourth of July was more like everybody doing firecrackers and</br>   of course I wanted to do that, too. When it was Dia de los Muertos, we</br>   celebrated a little bit different because we put an altar and we celebrate</br>   all our people who have passed away. Then the day before was Halloween, so</br>   we could dress up as whatever we wanted. Obviously, Christmas is both, but</br>   we mixed it because in the Mexican culture the Christmas is not only giving</br>   gifts, it's also doing, I don't know how you call them, when you go out and</br>   you sing songs, Christian songs-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Carols.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Carol songs or things like that. Instead of eating turkey, we ate Pozole.</br>   It was a little bit of both, of course.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tamales.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Tamales, yes. My parents had Chicano friends, they were third generation</br>   American, whose parents had moved there and they are already adults. Then</br>   their children were American, but they spoke Spanish. We had all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Which is your favorite holiday?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   My favorite holiday? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think, well, maybe every</br>   child's favorite holiday is Christmas because of the presents. I didn't</br>   really care about the presents. I cared more about everybody being there.</br>   Sometimes the whole family didn't see each other until the end of the year.</br>   I think that was the time where I really got to see all of my cousins or I</br>   really got to see my uncles. But a favorite holiday? I don't know, April</br>   Fool's maybe? [laughing] I could do a lot of pranks on people. I'm not</br>   sure. I don't think I had a favorite holiday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   One last question about this. There's a lot of people, and this was</br>   surprising too to us, talked about discrimination between Mexicans, illegal</br>   Mexicans, and Chicanos. Did you experience that?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe not, because I grew up as a Chicano. Maybe not that much. I do</br>   remember other people being discriminated because they were from Mexico but</br>   from provinces, so they got even more. They got called paisanos. They were</br>   darker skinned, so I did feel it, not me personally, but I did feel it for</br>   my peers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Because you were a city dude?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, well, the area where I lived wasn't a big city. It was like _______.</br>   It wasn't super big, but it wasn't small.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you weren't like people from the provinces, so you were considered</br>   Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. That's, I guess, because of the area where we lived. I don't know. I</br>   guess my parents always wanted us to live in the nicer area so I would hang</br>   out with people like that. Then, when I would go see my friends, they</br>   didn't have white neighbors they had Mexican neighbors or people from other</br>   countries. In the area where I lived, we were the only Mexicans in the</br>   area. I do remember my neighbors that were black, the person on the side,</br>   he was my middle school coach from PE classes. We grew up in a very nice</br>   area. We had a front yard, a back yard, we had a pool in the back, we had a</br>   trampoline, we had a swing. I guess that's why they were working all day so</br>   they could provide us with that type of lifestyle. I didn't really feel</br>   that personally, but I do remember other people discriminating. I don't</br>   want to say for lower class people, they did. They did get that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When you got arrested, what happened? You got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   Were you driving at the time or were you-</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I was driving. I was coming back from work. I had the truck. I had my</br>   father's truck. He had all the tools in the back, and I was just coming</br>   back from work. There was a checkpoint. I got pulled over. I had a</br>   permission that they give teenagers to drive. I remember giving that. Then</br>   they were asking me more questions and then I started getting nervous for</br>   some reason. Then they started questioning me, &quot;Hey, why are you so</br>   nervous?&quot; &quot;You're here. I don't know what you're trying to do.&quot; Then they</br>   took me into the, I don't know how to call it, separos, where they separate</br>   you from– There’s a glass window and they just put you in a room. They make</br>   you take off your shoes. It's like a cell, like a big cell. I do remember</br>   looking at people and they're like, &quot;Wow, man, these people really look</br>   bad. I'm just 18 years old. I'm just a child.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They detained me there. I was there for six hours. I remember not being fed</br>   until a police guy, I guess he was Hispanic, he asked me, &quot;Have you eaten?&quot;</br>   I said, &quot;No, I haven't.&quot; He went and got me some McDonald's. I do remember</br>   it was a long time, though. Then, they took me in to the county. I was in</br>   Arkansas. I went into _____________. Then that's whenever I said, &quot;Okay, so</br>   it's real.&quot; They put me into the outfit, it was an orange outfit. I was</br>   separated with other people. It was hard because I didn't know, I didn't</br>   understand like that. I said, &quot;Well, I don't think I can compare myself to</br>   them. They really are people who either hurt people or they’ve done</br>   damages. I don't think I have done that.&quot; I was in there with those people,</br>   so I guess they put me in the same category as those people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then they put us in a big cellblock, and they would ask me, &quot;Why are you</br>   here?&quot; I'd say, &quot;Just being illegal.&quot; And then I would ask them, &quot;Why are</br>   you here?&quot; &quot;Oh, first degree murder, armed robbery, possession of</br>   paraphernalia, drug trafficking.&quot; I was like, &quot;Wow. Well, I'm just</br>   illegal.&quot; They were like, &quot;Oh, don't worry. You're going to get out. You're</br>   not as bad as we are.&quot; I was like, &quot;I hope not.&quot; It was whites, blacks,</br>   from other nations, Mexican, Hispanic people. It was everybody mixed. I do</br>   remember people just being with each other. White people being with them,</br>   and black people being with them. I said, &quot;Why? Why can't we all just be</br>   together? It was like that at school, why can't it be here?&quot; But I guess I</br>   started learning that racism exists, and you have to either defend yourself</br>   or defend your people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember even defending a person from the Marshall Islands because a</br>   Mexican guy had taken his food. I said, &quot;Hey, man, don't take his food.</br>   That's all he got to eat.&quot; They were like, &quot;So, what, are you going to</br>   defend them now?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm just defending a person. He's just like</br>   us. We're all detained. We shouldn't be like that.&quot; But they got onto me</br>   and they said, &quot;Either you're with us or against us. If you're against us,</br>   we're more.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, I guess I can be with you guys,&quot; just for being</br>   scared. Then after that I was there for about a month. Then they took me to</br>   a real prison. I remember they asked us to do jobs like clean your cell,</br>   clean the bathrooms, and things like that. Again, I was only 18 years old.</br>   I didn't know why I was put in prison with those people. In there, yes, I</br>   met some people that really had done some really bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Was this a maximum security?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't know. I don't think it was maximum security, but it was a federal</br>   prison. I think it was called ____________ or something like that. I was</br>   there for a couple more months. It was the same thing in there. If you were</br>   Mexican, you had to be with Mexicans. There were people in there from</br>   Russia. There were people from all over the world. But it was a federal</br>   prison. I remember asking, &quot;Is this an immigration prison or is this a</br>   federal prison?&quot; &quot;No, it's both. We keep both immigrants and… you know&quot;</br>   Yeah, I did get scared a lot, especially with just being 18 years old and</br>   being with people who are either double my age or older. They really had</br>   gang tattoos all over their face. They had marks. They had a lot of things</br>   going on with them. I remember hearing stories that they did. I was like,</br>   &quot;Wow.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [43:33] They would ask me, &quot;So why are you in here for?&quot; I didn't want to</br>   lie because I didn't want to make them think that I was a bad person or</br>   like, &quot;Yeah, I'm hard, too.&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I'm just here because I'm</br>   illegal.&quot; Then I remember a group of Mexicans from Mexico City approaching</br>   me. It was like 18 people. They were like, &quot;So, why are you here?&quot; &quot;I'm</br>   just illegal.&quot; They put me in a room. I thought, I don't know, you hear a</br>   lot of stories that they're going to do to you. But they were actually –</br>   They had my back. It was like, &quot;You are our youngest guy here. Don't worry.</br>   We're going to take care of you. What do you need?&quot; They gave me food, they</br>   gave me clothing, they gave me sandals.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   These are inmates.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, inmates. They said, &quot;We're going to protect you but at the same time</br>   if you see something happening, you need to step up. It doesn't matter if</br>   your cellmate is white. If he goes out and harms another one of our guys,</br>   you have to step in. If not, we're going to step you out.&quot; Luckily nothing</br>   ever happened when I was in there. But it was drastically [unintelligible</br>   43:48]. It was a new experience for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You discovered racism in prison.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Real racism. In school you always hear people talking, but then the next</br>   day we're friends again. We have to be in the same class and do group</br>   activities. I guess now that I think about it, those kids, they were just</br>   acting what they would see on TV or what their parents taught them. But,</br>   yeah, once I got to prison, I guess I felt it more directly. During high</br>   school, it's just a normal shit talker saying, &quot;Hey, go back to Mexico, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; You can always defend yourself there, saying, &quot;Hey,</br>   you're not even from here neither, so what are you talking about?&quot; Or &quot;I</br>   could be more American than you. Ask me any question and I'll answer it</br>   just as well as you can.&quot; I guess that was our power was being able to</br>   speak English and say, &quot;Hey, I can speak Spanish and you can't and I'm</br>   already learning French,&quot; because I took French classes. &quot;You don't even -&quot;</br>   Things like that. It was just more like bullies trying to be a bully.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Not really a racist. I do remember when I was working in construction, we</br>   went to a chicken house to do a couple of jobs there. One of the guys, not</br>   my co-workers but one of the guys that I guess it was his property, he did</br>   say something that I got offended at. But at the same time, I said, &quot;Well,</br>   it's kind of real.&quot; He said that he had left out some shoes or boots out on</br>   the field and the next day that he went to go get them, they weren't there.</br>   He said, &quot;One of those Mexicans probably stole them.&quot; It was probably true</br>   because there were some people that did those activities, but at the same</br>   time you're not sure. What if it was one of your own guys? Or what if you</br>   misplaced them? I did get back at him. I remember getting some scissors and</br>   I started cutting all his fence. I just started cutting the wires like,</br>   &quot;Okay. Now you can really talk about it. Yes.&quot; I guess that was my form of</br>   defending myself. I don't think it was the best thing.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember that day I was crying back home. I said, &quot;How can people just, I</br>   don't know, how can they discriminate if really if we take out our skin,</br>   we're the same on the inside? We both have flesh and bone. We're going to</br>   bleed the same.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It doesn't matter where you're from. We're the</br>   same on the inside.&quot; I guess that was one of the few things because I</br>   worked with American people my whole life. They gave me jobs, they fed me,</br>   they would invite me into their house. Some people had pools, said, &quot;Hey,</br>   we're going to have a pool party and I want you to come because you're one</br>   of my workers.&quot; Christmas parties where the company invites the whole</br>   co-workers to eat. I don't think I felt it until that day and until I</br>   arrived to prison.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did anything bad happen to you in prison?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No. Actually I was well taken care of by those people. They always told me</br>   that if I ever need anything, I should just call them or walk up to them</br>   and they would try to take care of me because I was the youngest. Most of</br>   the people were in their late 20s, 50s and I was the only teenager. They</br>   were like, &quot;No, you don't belong here. We're going to take care of you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did your family visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They couldn't. They couldn't because they were illegal too, so they</br>   couldn't. They couldn't. I guess the only other way was to write letters. I</br>   never received any letter, but I do remember writing them. That was our</br>   freedom through writing letters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But you didn't receive any.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did they write you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Probably not. No, probably not. I think my dad said he did, but I never</br>   received it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you see your family again before you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I came back home. I came back home, and we fought my case, and my dad</br>   was actually locked up with me in county. He didn't go to prison like I</br>   did. He got out pretty quickly. I don't know why even. I'm not sure why. I</br>   don't know why I was the only person that was taken to prison. I don't</br>   know. Maybe they were just trying to prove a point. Then my dad came back</br>   to Mexico first. But I do remember meeting up with my family and then them</br>   telling us that we have to do something or we're going to keep getting</br>   those type of cases. Actually, my sister was sent to Mexico first. She</br>   didn't get any deportation. My mom sent her back to Mexico. She was only 15</br>   years old.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [49:44] Then my dad came back and then I was living with my mom. I guess</br>   that was one of the most difficult part of my life was being with my mom</br>   and watching her struggle because I couldn't really work because I didn't</br>   have the papers. She could because she also had an illegal name there. She</br>   wasn't working under her name. She had another person's papers. She was</br>   able to work, but instead of my dad helping her out, it was on her. Of</br>   course, she had car payments, rent, bills. That's when I saw and I said,</br>   &quot;Hey, I need to do something. If I stay here, all I am doing is causing my</br>   mom to spend more money.&quot; So, I told her, &quot;Hey, I think I'm going to go</br>   back.&quot; Then I came to Mexico. She still stayed there. She was probably</br>   there for 20 years. But she moved to a different city.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is she back now?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, she's back now. Yeah, she's been here for maybe five years, four</br>   years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   She stayed all by herself for another five years?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   For another– I had stayed for 13, she stayed there for another seven years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why didn't she come back?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   She was trying to make money so when she could come back, we would have</br>   something. She did do it because now she has a car. I guess that was it.</br>   But as my mom and dad got separated, they eventually divorced. It was hard</br>   on both of us, my sister and I. I did feel guilty because I thought that</br>   because of me being deported caused my mom to send my sister and it caused</br>   my parents to separate. I did feel bad about that. It was horrible because</br>   I felt like I was a bad person. I felt like it was my fault that my parents</br>   got divorced. I felt really bad.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [51:59] Then as I got older, maybe in my mid 20s or early on, when I was</br>   25, I learned that I had nothing to do with it. It was their choice.</br>   Recently, my mom came to visit here, and it was amazing because once again</br>   my whole family was sitting down at a table eating together. My mom has a</br>   boyfriend, my dad has a girlfriend, so I guess they put those issues aside</br>   as, &quot;Hey now, we're still family. It doesn't matter who's next to us. We're</br>   always going to be a family.&quot; This happened last month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It was like Christmas.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it was amazing. We all sat down at the same table to eat. I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, we can work this out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us about coming back. You said it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [53:02] Yeah. Maybe not coming back. I was really excited. I was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   yeah. I'm going to go back to Mexico and everything's going to go perfect</br>   because I'm Mexican.&quot; I came back and I tried to go to school. It was too</br>   expensive. I either had to work or study but I didn't have the money to</br>   study. I wanted to be a welder. I tried to do it here in Mexico, but they</br>   didn't pay at all. They didn't pay well at all. My uncle told me to become</br>   a teacher. I didn't want to, obviously. Who wants to be a teacher of other</br>   children? I saw the potential. All my cousins say, &quot;Hey, you teach me</br>   English because they're asking me at my job to have a percentage.&quot; Friends</br>   telling me, &quot;Hey, teach me English,&quot; or including meeting girls. They were</br>   like, &quot;Hey, you speak English? You should come teach me.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah. Why</br>   not?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was good for that part but at the same time I did feel discrimination by</br>   my own people because they were saying, &quot;Hey, you're American. What are you</br>   doing here?&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I'm Mexican. I was born here,&quot; because my Spanish</br>   wasn't good. Even still today it's not the best. They're like, &quot;You need to</br>   learn how to speak Spanish.&quot; I said, &quot;I do speak Spanish, just not as</br>   well.&quot; It's like, &quot;You need to learn how to speak English.&quot; My defense has</br>   always been like that, &quot;Yeah, okay, you too.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Should’ve spoken to them in French.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Yeah, and I didn't use it then, but I should have. But I did feel a</br>   cultural shock especially because, in Mexico City there's all kinds of</br>   people, all kinds of people. Of course, when I was in United States, I</br>   would hang out with people that listened to hip hop. That was it. I didn't</br>   really meet people that listened to metal music or reggae or things like</br>   that. I started going out with my cousin, he's a guitar player, so he</br>   started inviting me to his events. I would see different kinds of people.</br>   People with long hair, makeup on, all black. I thought it was pretty cool,</br>   like, &quot;Okay, they have their own identity.&quot; Then I would go into the reggae</br>   events and saw people with dreadlocks, different type of black style,</br>   including people that worship other– Not just Christianity but people that</br>   practice Buddhism or practice Satanism or things like that. I said, &quot;Wow.</br>   It's amazing.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to</br>   hip hop, like, &quot;Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.&quot;</br>   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that</br>   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,</br>   they say, &quot;No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; Those</br>   were the words. I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yes. The way you</br>   have tattoos, the way you dress. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; I</br>   said, &quot;What does that have to do with my knowledge? I'm probably smarter</br>   than that guy right there. What does that have to do with my knowledge?&quot;</br>   &quot;No.&quot; Because I had piercings also. Then it's, &quot;Because our image is not</br>   like that.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Every job I try to go get, it was like, &quot;No.&quot; I was shut down. I learned</br>   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started</br>   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go</br>   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's</br>   like, &quot;Wow. So, it was just all about image.&quot; If you look nice, they're</br>   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or</br>   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my</br>   advantage and said, &quot;Okay. I need to do something.&quot; That's when I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, maybe teaching is a good opportunity since everybody's asking.&quot; I</br>   started looking for schools.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then there was this one school that they said, &quot;Hey, I don't care how you</br>   look, just you do need to change some things, but I'm not asking you to</br>   completely change yourself. Just so that you can seem legit.&quot; I'm like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I can do that, I guess.&quot; I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,</br>   &quot;Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?&quot; I said, &quot;Why not? Maybe</br>   it could be better.&quot; So, I did change for that school, but then I realized</br>   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to</br>   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, &quot;No. I can't do that no more.</br>   I can't.&quot; Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's</br>   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.</br>   So, I said, &quot;No. I have to quit. I have to quit. I am getting paid well, I</br>   have everything I have because of that, but I can't lose my identity.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got out, and then I realized that I didn't have to be different. I could</br>   still be me, but I could act some way around certain people. Yeah, it was</br>   hard because I didn't want to, I didn't want to but I felt like I have to</br>   because if I didn't I wouldn't get what I wanted, or obtain what I would</br>   get. But I do feel bad for becoming, not a total prick, but I do remember</br>   saying, &quot;I don't know, don't buy from him because he's from the street,&quot; or</br>   &quot;Don't buy your groceries there because it's not a good store.&quot; Things like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is that becoming a prick or was that becoming more Mexican chi-chi?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Oh, okay. I kind of guess that. Like, &quot;Oh, I don't want to take the Metro</br>   because I'd rather take a taxi.&quot; Things like that. Because I was making</br>   more money and I could afford a taxi. I said, &quot;No, that's not me. My</br>   parents never taught me to be like that.&quot; That's why I left that school. It</br>   was a very big school, but they did practice Christianity. They kind of,</br>   not forced us, but they said, &quot;Hey, if you want to be part of this, you</br>   have to follow this, you have to come to our meetings, you have to come to</br>   our events.&quot; I guess that's what made me turn a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It didn't appeal to you, the Christianity?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't mind it, but if they're trying to force it on me, then I say– It</br>   could have been like other religions. I just feel like if they try to force</br>   something on me, I'll say, &quot;No. I'm sorry, but you can't do that.&quot; Because</br>   my parents, they're Catholic and my mom eventually became Christian because</br>   of her cousins in the United States. I had a lot of ideas. Once I arrived</br>   to Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, I don't want to be part of no religion. I do</br>   believe in God, but I don't want to be part of no religion.&quot; I guess that</br>   made me see things differently because there are lot of beggars in the</br>   street, and that school taught me to look at them differently. I didn't</br>   like that. Or when we had events, we all had to dress nice and everything.</br>   When we walk in the street to go to that event, we would see beggars in the</br>   street. My co-workers, they would look at them with, &quot;Ugh.&quot; I guess I</br>   started to do it the same just to be part of it. I realized, &quot;No. I'm</br>   wrong. I'm wrong for doing that. That person is just like me. He's also a</br>   human.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Speaking to my cousin helped me out a lot because he had other beliefs. He</br>   was more into the historic part of things rather than to look at it how it</br>   is. If he would talk about religion, he'd say, &quot;It's just a part of</br>   history. We're all the same. It doesn't matter if you follow this or that.</br>   We're still human.&quot; He made me realize that it doesn't matter what religion</br>   you are, you're still a human. When we're born, they say, &quot;Hey, he's born a</br>   human.&quot; They don't say, &quot;Hey, he's born a Christian,&quot; or &quot;He's born</br>   something.&quot; I guess he made me open my eyes towards that. That's when I</br>   realized that I have to leave that school so I wouldn't become something</br>   that I'm not. Now I don't discriminate no religion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Listening to you, it makes me think of the fact that you had this choice to</br>   leave. In prison, you didn't have a choice. To survive, you had to be with</br>   the Mexicans, you had to play that. But once you were here, you could</br>   exercise your free choice, right? Your free will.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. I could.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You described the prison where you had to be with the Mexicans because it</br>   was a question of life and death.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But here, you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't have to. I didn't have to. Right. Yeah, I guess that part has been</br>   struggling for me. I always think that there's a right and a wrong, but</br>   that's on both ends. What about the middle part? I don't want to be right</br>   nor wrong. I want to investigate first. I don't want people to tell me,</br>   &quot;Hey, you have to do this because it's the right thing.&quot; I would say, &quot;Hey,</br>   but you're not telling me what the bad thing is so how do I know what your</br>   right is also my right?&quot; I guess that becoming neutral to things because</br>   too much of one thing can also be bad. Not enough of another thing can also</br>   be bad. You have to always keep it in the middle, keep it neutral. There's</br>   no right or wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did you feel the Mexican government treats returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They don't care. They have no – They don't care. I guess now that we've</br>   become more, they're starting to look into it. But back then, they didn't</br>   care. Even if you're Mexican living here, they didn't care so why would</br>   they care about another person that hasn't been here? I don't think they</br>   care.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   If you were given a chance to talk to them and to say, &quot;You should care,&quot;</br>   do you think they should care?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't think they should care.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't think I would want to sit and talk to them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why do you think they should care? What's the argument? Why do they have it</br>   wrong?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Because we're a big community. If they want our vote, they need to start to</br>   care. A lot of us, it's going to be either the first or second time that we</br>   vote. They have to start caring and start to look into our community</br>   because we're also Mexican, but we're not Mexican from here, we're Mexican</br>   from another place. They should care because if they want our vote, they</br>   should also start looking into that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Do you think you bring special skills that they're missing?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. Yes. English. Mexico is – I hear they want to make Mexico in the next</br>   20 years to become bilingual. They can't do that without us. They can't.</br>   They can try, but it's like learning Spanish in the United States. You'll</br>   learn it, but you're not going to learn Spanish like we do in Mexico. We</br>   have that. We have both Spanish from here and both English from there. They</br>   should start to look into that. I don't know how to answer that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about your education?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   That, too. I feel like a lot of us that have come back, we don't have that</br>   opportunity to continue our education because we don't have the money. We</br>   don't have – Including just to get your ID here, you go through a lot. You</br>   have to take a lot of documents that you don't even know if you have. A lot</br>   of people that came back, they don't even know what Mexico is like. Even</br>   trying to get an education, what are we going to study? What career can we</br>   make, or can we select to become part of a helpful community? My best guess</br>   is languages, not only English but other languages like French or German. I</br>   think if we want to be a first world country, we have to act like it.</br>   That's where our government is not putting its full potential because we do</br>   have the resources, but they're so corrupted that they'd rather keep that</br>   to themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about values?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Values?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Do you think that growing up in the U.S. you come back with certain</br>   values?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Now that you mentioned it, yes, we do bring a lot of values, especially in</br>   the cleanliness. In Mexico City, everybody's accustomed to whenever they</br>   finish their package of whatever food they have, they just throw it on the</br>   floor. Not everybody, of course, but most of the people do that. Us,</br>   growing up in the States, we know that that's a horrible thing. Like, &quot;You</br>   shouldn't do that. What type of person are you?&quot; You know? That's one</br>   thing. Cleanliness. We bring that. Being independent. Over there in the</br>   United States, when you're 18 like most of the people that turn 18, they</br>   get to live in their own apartment, have their own car. Here in Mexico, of</br>   course we can't afford it. Sometimes we're 25 and we still live with our</br>   parents and we still have to give them some type of expense. Maybe that.</br>   Being independent.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember my cousins telling me when I was only 18, and I was trying to</br>   have my own apartment already. They're like, &quot;Why? Why? You should just</br>   live with your dad.&quot; I'd go, &quot;No. I want to have my own room. I want to</br>   have my own kitchen.&quot; They're like, &quot;No, don't worry about that. You can</br>   just ...&quot; I don't know. I guess we're more attached in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that you come back with certain values that are</br>   different?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Some of us. Not all of them. Not all of us. But I think if we gather</br>   together and separate our difference, then yeah. I think it's possible. It</br>   maybe is going to take a long time because even here in Mexico we tend…</br>   Let's just say in Mexico, él que no transa, no avanza.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   No transa, no avanza?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. Do you know what that means?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. If you don't transact, you don't make it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't negotiate.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Exactly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Make, connect, whatever, pay off.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe if we stop thinking like that, because like I said, if you enter a</br>   system that they're going to pull you in. Maybe if we stop thinking like</br>   that and say, &quot;Hey, I'm not doing this for me, I'm doing this for all of</br>   us,&quot; the next person can say the same thing. He can influence another</br>   person to think the same thing because I think that here in Mexico, it's</br>   all about what I can do for myself, not really for others. Maybe if we</br>   change just a little bit on how we think, then maybe we could. Maybe we're</br>   the ones that need to plant the seeds so that the next generations could do</br>   it. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Do you feel Mexican or American or both?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I've always been asked that question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   I know.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I always say, &quot;I can be more Mexican because I love history and I love</br>   studying about my culture here as a Mexican. I know more than the average</br>   person does about Mexico.&quot; Then they question me about, &quot;How is it like to</br>   be an American?&quot; I have that answer also. But now-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What's that answer?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Now I don't want to be a nationality. I want to be a human. If aliens from</br>   different planet come, they're going to be, &quot;Oh, wait, not the Mexicans</br>   because they're cool. Not the Americans.&quot; No, they're going to say, &quot;Hey,</br>   all of you are humans and we're going to take over.&quot; I hope it never</br>   happens, but I don't think I want to be Mexican. I don't think I want to be</br>   American. I just want to be human. I think because if we are placed in that</br>   category of just a nationality, then it reduces everything because people</br>   categorize. Even in movies, they say, &quot;Best Mexican actor,&quot; or something</br>   like that. Like, &quot;No. He's an actor or an actress. He or she shouldn't be</br>   categorized as best Mexican or best Hispanic. They're humans. They have the</br>   talent just like anybody else.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   <span id="a1769b54-64e8-4808-be8e-243c1dfca2e8" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Global/Human, Bi-cultural">I don't want to say that I'm Mexican or American.

 <br>
   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to<br>
   hip hop, like, &quot;Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.&quot;<br>
   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that<br>
   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,<br>
   they say, &quot;No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; Those<br>
   were the words. I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yes. The way you<br>
   have tattoos, the way you dress. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; I<br>
   said, &quot;What does that have to do with my knowledge? I'm probably smarter<br>
   than that guy right there. What does that have to do with my knowledge?&quot;<br>
   &quot;No.&quot; Because I had piercings also. Then it's, &quot;Because our image is not<br>
   like that.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sylent:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Every job I try to go get, it was like, &quot;No.&quot; I was shut down. I learned<br>
   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started<br>
   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go<br>
   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's<br>
   like, &quot;Wow. So, it was just all about image.&quot; If you look nice, they're<br>
   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or<br>
   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my<br>
   advantage and said, &quot;Okay. I need to do something.&quot; That's when I said,<br>
   &quot;Okay, maybe teaching is a good opportunity since everybody's asking.&quot; I<br>
   started looking for schools.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sylent:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Then there was this one school that they said, &quot;Hey, I don't care how you<br>
   look, just you do need to change some things, but I'm not asking you to<br>
   completely change yourself. Just so that you can seem legit.&quot; I'm like,<br>
   &quot;Okay. I can do that, I guess.&quot; I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,<br>
   &quot;Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?&quot; I said, &quot;Why not? Maybe<br>
   it could be better.&quot; So, I did change for that school, but then I realized<br>
   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to<br>
   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, &quot;No. I can't do that no more.<br>
   I can't.&quot; Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's<br>
   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.<br>
   So, I said, &quot;No. I have to quit. I have to quit. I am getting paid well, I<br>
   have everything I have because of that, but I can't lose my identity.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sylent:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   I got out, and then I realized that I didn't have to be different. I could<br>
   still be me, but I could act some way around certain people. Yeah, it was<br>
   hard because I didn't want to, I didn't want to but I felt like I have to<br>
   because if I didn't I wouldn't get what I wanted, or obtain what I would<br>
   get. But I do feel bad for becoming, not a total prick, but I do remember<br>
   saying, &quot;I don't know, don't buy from him because he's from the street,&quot; or<br>
   &quot;Don't buy your groceries there because it's not a good store.&quot; Things like<br>
   that.<br>

How does that sound to you?</br>   It's something I've been thinking about.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess it's the-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You're literally wearing it on your sleeve.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I live it. I guess this is the street slang. We always use different</br>   vocabulary than the ones they use just to be different, I guess. We have</br>   our own lingo. We definitely want to represent. It's not like we're hiding</br>   or anything, but we want to also express ourselves to our full potential. I</br>   think that's one of the best ways. I got into the hip hop culture as a very</br>   young child, so I knew that there was graffiti, there was music, there was</br>   rapping, there was break dancing. We took that, and we placed our own</br>   little bits of ourselves into it. I guess that's where it comes from. I've</br>   heard immigrant. In school, I remember in elementary school, we were, there</br>   was a class called ESL.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They would call us migrant students. And I didn't understand what it was</br>   until I grew older and started looking at the vocabulary. I saw that it</br>   could be you know, an alien. I said, &quot;Yes, we are aliens. We're from a</br>   different planet called Mexico.&quot; I guess that's how it started and just</br>   people picking on us that we're illegal, &quot;Go back to your country,&quot; and</br>   things like that. We definitely wanted to make that statement. Like, &quot;Yes,</br>   we are illegal. So what?&quot; That's how it started.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   A couple things with that. You said that you didn't know that you were</br>   illegal, though.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When did you discover that you weren't? Did you have American friends?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes, of course. My grandfather was originally born in Texas. He came to</br>   Mexico when he was only seven years old. I didn't know I was illegal</br>   because I thought that my family had moved to a different part of the</br>   planet. I didn't think it was a bad thing. Of course, you see in the news,</br>   you start seeing people getting deported. I didn't understand it, but I</br>   somehow thought I was. I never asked my parents about it. We never really</br>   spoke about it. All my friends, of course, they were American. My neighbors</br>   were American. I guess in high school, maybe that's when it started up. I</br>   started investigating because there was, how do you call it, marchas?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Protests.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Protests. I would see on TV students stepping out. I said, &quot;Hey, I think I</br>   should be doing that. I'm not sure.&quot; Then once I just got pulled over and I</br>   said, &quot;Oh, I'm American. I've been here my whole life. I have my</br>   documents.&quot; They actually told me, &quot;Well, you're right about some things,</br>   but wrong about different things. Yes, you have been here your whole life,</br>   but you didn't cross legally into the States. That's why” I said, &quot;Oh,</br>   okay. So, we are illegal.&quot; That's when I confirmed it, I guess. In the back</br>   of my mind, I thought I was, but I never actually officially heard it or</br>   knew about it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then after high school, when I got pulled over, they brought me to county</br>   and took me to prison. I said, &quot;Okay, so it's real. I am illegal.&quot; Then</br>   after I fought my case and I came back out, that's when I really started to</br>   say, &quot;Okay, yes, I am illegal. I am undocumented and I need to do something</br>   about it.&quot; I guess back then the easiest way was to get married with</br>   someone and they could fix you up. But I was 18 years old. I said, &quot;No, I'd</br>   rather go back to Mexico.&quot; At the same time, I wanted to learn about my</br>   culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   When they pulled you over, what did they pull you over for?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was like a checkup. It was a checkpoint.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   A checkpoint.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. It was just a checkpoint. That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did they treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess that first police officer, he was normal about it. He was like,</br>   &quot;I'm just doing my job. You have to go here.&quot; Then once I got actually</br>   arrested, that's when things changed because they treated me like if I were</br>   an animal, or if I had done something really wrong. It wasn't the case. I</br>   did get in trouble like any normal kid. I don't know, maybe breaking</br>   something or with other guys playing in the street or fighting or things</br>   like that, but I don't know. I guess after I got arrested, and they put the</br>   handcuffs on me, that's when they started treating me like if I were a</br>   criminal. I said, &quot;Why? I didn't do anything. I was only seven years old</br>   when I crossed.&quot; But I thought I crossed like everybody does. I guess it</br>   was after I got arrested that I started seeing the real discrimination with</br>   the authorities. In school, maybe just a typical guy that says, &quot;Hey, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; I would fight back saying, &quot;Hey, you don't either</br>   because your ancestors are not even from America.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you say, &quot;My dad was born in Texas,&quot; My grandpa?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't know then until I came back to Mexico. I don't know. I don't think</br>   my parents were trying to hide that. I think they were just trying to live,</br>   to continue living. I found out a lot of things when I came back to Mexico.</br>   Yeah, it was hard at first. I think I am actually happy that I haven't,</br>   otherwise I wouldn't be the person that I am now. That's how it was.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But were you a member of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I knew people. The area where I lived there was all kinds of gangs. I did</br>   get affiliated. I didn't want to, but I guess I couldn't for some reason,</br>   or I did go out and hang out with them. I did do a lot of things that they</br>   did, but I never considered myself part of it. I thought I was just</br>   affiliated. I thought it was normal because everybody was doing it. Not</br>   only in my city but in other cities. I saw the TV, so I thought it was just</br>   something normal that teenagers went through and eventually they get back</br>   on track. I thought it was just part of being a teenager. I didn't really</br>   think I was, &quot;Oh, I want to be the biggest gang member in the world.&quot; I</br>   just thought, &quot;Oh, yeah, it's cool.&quot; I did want to be part of something,</br>   obviously. I didn't want to feel left out. I did have family members that</br>   did represent them more than that. I thought it was just normal.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I lived in Arkansas, so I remember a lot of people from California started</br>   coming in. A lot of people from Chicago started coming in. So, There was</br>   like a lot of activities going on. I just thought it was part of just being</br>   a normal teenager because including my, I don't want to discriminate, but</br>   my white friends, they were going through other things as well, so I was</br>   like, &quot;Oh, it's just this normal thing.&quot; My black friends, they were doing</br>   similar things, so I didn't think it was only Mexicans. I thought it was</br>   just in general.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What were your white friends and black friends doing that was the</br>   equivalent?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Well, graffiti. We used to love writing on the walls. Or, I don't know,</br>   smoking marijuana. Things like that. Not like damaging or killing people,</br>   nothing like that. But more like the lighter stuff. Especially my white</br>   friends, they were the ones that really had the marijuana. We didn't know</br>   where to get that. My black friends, well they were more into the hip hop</br>   and graffiti culture. So, I thought that was pretty cool, and I would go in</br>   the library and started just searching books about it. I said, &quot;Okay, it's</br>   normal.&quot; There were like what you call crews, depending on which area that</br>   you lived. For example, this is the Centro so all the little kids from the</br>   Centro would hang out and they would go compete with the people from uptown</br>   and things like that. I guess that was just it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then eventually it got more into music. Instead of fighting each other we</br>   would like rap and insult each other but in a more clever way. At the end</br>   of the day, &quot;Okay, you did good. I like what you said about them,&quot; or &quot;I</br>   like what you said about this.&quot; It's just part of the culture for me to</br>   grow like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Let me go back and then if you could talk a little bit more about the</br>   experience in detention, that would be important for us to know about it.</br>   When you grew up, did you see a lot of your parents? Were they working all</br>   the time? What was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess I grew up more with my grandma because she would go and come back.</br>   During summer, I would stay with my grandma more. Yeah, I did see my father</br>   a lot. Mostly my father. My mom was the one that was more time at her job</br>   because she became a supervisor of a company, so she had to be there most</br>   of the time. My father was just a construction worker so after a certain</br>   time, he can't work anymore because of the light. I grew up with my father</br>   a lot. My sister and I, he would take us to the park, take us swimming. I</br>   don't feel like I missed them too much. I always felt that we were a</br>   family. No, I don't think I got that experience. I do know of other friends</br>   that their parents were at work all day and he was by himself at the house.</br>   I was like, &quot;Hey, just come over here. You can come play at my house.&quot; We</br>   had a trampoline and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you celebrated both American and Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Well, January 6 is the Dia de los Santos Reyes Magos, so of course I wanted</br>   my toys. Then fourth of July was more like everybody doing firecrackers and</br>   of course I wanted to do that, too. When it was Dia de los Muertos, we</br>   celebrated a little bit different because we put an altar and we celebrate</br>   all our people who have passed away. Then the day before was Halloween, so</br>   we could dress up as whatever we wanted. Obviously, Christmas is both, but</br>   we mixed it because in the Mexican culture the Christmas is not only giving</br>   gifts, it's also doing, I don't know how you call them, when you go out and</br>   you sing songs, Christian songs-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Carols.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Carol songs or things like that. Instead of eating turkey, we ate Pozole.</br>   It was a little bit of both, of course.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tamales.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Tamales, yes. My parents had Chicano friends, they were third generation</br>   American, whose parents had moved there and they are already adults. Then</br>   their children were American, but they spoke Spanish. We had all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Which is your favorite holiday?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   My favorite holiday? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think, well, maybe every</br>   child's favorite holiday is Christmas because of the presents. I didn't</br>   really care about the presents. I cared more about everybody being there.</br>   Sometimes the whole family didn't see each other until the end of the year.</br>   I think that was the time where I really got to see all of my cousins or I</br>   really got to see my uncles. But a favorite holiday? I don't know, April</br>   Fool's maybe? [laughing] I could do a lot of pranks on people. I'm not</br>   sure. I don't think I had a favorite holiday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   One last question about this. There's a lot of people, and this was</br>   surprising too to us, talked about discrimination between Mexicans, illegal</br>   Mexicans, and Chicanos. Did you experience that?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe not, because I grew up as a Chicano. Maybe not that much. I do</br>   remember other people being discriminated because they were from Mexico but</br>   from provinces, so they got even more. They got called paisanos. They were</br>   darker skinned, so I did feel it, not me personally, but I did feel it for</br>   my peers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Because you were a city dude?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, well, the area where I lived wasn't a big city. It was like _______.</br>   It wasn't super big, but it wasn't small.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you weren't like people from the provinces, so you were considered</br>   Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. That's, I guess, because of the area where we lived. I don't know. I</br>   guess my parents always wanted us to live in the nicer area so I would hang</br>   out with people like that. Then, when I would go see my friends, they</br>   didn't have white neighbors they had Mexican neighbors or people from other</br>   countries. In the area where I lived, we were the only Mexicans in the</br>   area. I do remember my neighbors that were black, the person on the side,</br>   he was my middle school coach from PE classes. We grew up in a very nice</br>   area. We had a front yard, a back yard, we had a pool in the back, we had a</br>   trampoline, we had a swing. I guess that's why they were working all day so</br>   they could provide us with that type of lifestyle. I didn't really feel</br>   that personally, but I do remember other people discriminating. I don't</br>   want to say for lower class people, they did. They did get that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When you got arrested, what happened? You got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   Were you driving at the time or were you-</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I was driving. I was coming back from work. I had the truck. I had my</br>   father's truck. He had all the tools in the back, and I was just coming</br>   back from work. There was a checkpoint. I got pulled over. I had a</br>   permission that they give teenagers to drive. I remember giving that. Then</br>   they were asking me more questions and then I started getting nervous for</br>   some reason. Then they started questioning me, &quot;Hey, why are you so</br>   nervous?&quot; &quot;You're here. I don't know what you're trying to do.&quot; Then they</br>   took me into the, I don't know how to call it, separos, where they separate</br>   you from– There’s a glass window and they just put you in a room. They make</br>   you take off your shoes. It's like a cell, like a big cell. I do remember</br>   looking at people and they're like, &quot;Wow, man, these people really look</br>   bad. I'm just 18 years old. I'm just a child.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They detained me there. I was there for six hours. I remember not being fed</br>   until a police guy, I guess he was Hispanic, he asked me, &quot;Have you eaten?&quot;</br>   I said, &quot;No, I haven't.&quot; He went and got me some McDonald's. I do remember</br>   it was a long time, though. Then, they took me in to the county. I was in</br>   Arkansas. I went into _____________. Then that's whenever I said, &quot;Okay, so</br>   it's real.&quot; They put me into the outfit, it was an orange outfit. I was</br>   separated with other people. It was hard because I didn't know, I didn't</br>   understand like that. I said, &quot;Well, I don't think I can compare myself to</br>   them. They really are people who either hurt people or they’ve done</br>   damages. I don't think I have done that.&quot; I was in there with those people,</br>   so I guess they put me in the same category as those people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then they put us in a big cellblock, and they would ask me, &quot;Why are you</br>   here?&quot; I'd say, &quot;Just being illegal.&quot; And then I would ask them, &quot;Why are</br>   you here?&quot; &quot;Oh, first degree murder, armed robbery, possession of</br>   paraphernalia, drug trafficking.&quot; I was like, &quot;Wow. Well, I'm just</br>   illegal.&quot; They were like, &quot;Oh, don't worry. You're going to get out. You're</br>   not as bad as we are.&quot; I was like, &quot;I hope not.&quot; It was whites, blacks,</br>   from other nations, Mexican, Hispanic people. It was everybody mixed. I do</br>   remember people just being with each other. White people being with them,</br>   and black people being with them. I said, &quot;Why? Why can't we all just be</br>   together? It was like that at school, why can't it be here?&quot; But I guess I</br>   started learning that racism exists, and you have to either defend yourself</br>   or defend your people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember even defending a person from the Marshall Islands because a</br>   Mexican guy had taken his food. I said, &quot;Hey, man, don't take his food.</br>   That's all he got to eat.&quot; They were like, &quot;So, what, are you going to</br>   defend them now?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm just defending a person. He's just like</br>   us. We're all detained. We shouldn't be like that.&quot; But they got onto me</br>   and they said, &quot;Either you're with us or against us. If you're against us,</br>   we're more.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, I guess I can be with you guys,&quot; just for being</br>   scared. Then after that I was there for about a month. Then they took me to</br>   a real prison. I remember they asked us to do jobs like clean your cell,</br>   clean the bathrooms, and things like that. Again, I was only 18 years old.</br>   I didn't know why I was put in prison with those people. In there, yes, I</br>   met some people that really had done some really bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Was this a maximum security?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't know. I don't think it was maximum security, but it was a federal</br>   prison. I think it was called ____________ or something like that. I was</br>   there for a couple more months. It was the same thing in there. If you were</br>   Mexican, you had to be with Mexicans. There were people in there from</br>   Russia. There were people from all over the world. But it was a federal</br>   prison. I remember asking, &quot;Is this an immigration prison or is this a</br>   federal prison?&quot; &quot;No, it's both. We keep both immigrants and… you know&quot;</br>   Yeah, I did get scared a lot, especially with just being 18 years old and</br>   being with people who are either double my age or older. They really had</br>   gang tattoos all over their face. They had marks. They had a lot of things</br>   going on with them. I remember hearing stories that they did. I was like,</br>   &quot;Wow.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [43:33] <span id="2585d851-c293-4202-baf5-a51fd0e594fb" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Arrests, Prison">They would ask me, &quot;So why are you in here for?&quot; I didn't want to<br>
   lie because I didn't want to make them think that I was a bad person or<br>
   like, &quot;Yeah, I'm hard, too.&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I'm just here because I'm<br>
   illegal.&quot; Then I remember a group of Mexicans from Mexico City approaching<br>
   me. It was like 18 people. They were like, &quot;So, why are you here?&quot; &quot;I'm<br>
   just illegal.&quot; They put me in a room. I thought, I don't know, you hear a<br>
   lot of stories that they're going to do to you. But they were actually –<br>
   They had my back. It was like, &quot;You are our youngest guy here. Don't worry.<br>
   We're going to take care of you. What do you need?&quot; They gave me food, they<br>
   gave me clothing, they gave me sandals.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita:</br> </br> </br>   These are inmates.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, inmates. They said, &quot;We're going to protect you but at the same time</br>   if you see something happening, you need to step up. It doesn't matter if</br>   your cellmate is white. If he goes out and harms another one of our guys,</br>   you have to step in. If not, we're going to step you out.&quot; Luckily nothing</br>   ever happened when I was in there. But it was drastically [unintelligible</br>   43:48]. It was a new experience for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You discovered racism in prison.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Real racism. In school you always hear people talking, but then the next</br>   day we're friends again. We have to be in the same class and do group</br>   activities. I guess now that I think about it, those kids, they were just</br>   acting what they would see on TV or what their parents taught them. But,</br>   yeah, once I got to prison, I guess I felt it more directly. During high</br>   school, it's just a normal shit talker saying, &quot;Hey, go back to Mexico, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; You can always defend yourself there, saying, &quot;Hey,</br>   you're not even from here neither, so what are you talking about?&quot; Or &quot;I</br>   could be more American than you. Ask me any question and I'll answer it</br>   just as well as you can.&quot; I guess that was our power was being able to</br>   speak English and say, &quot;Hey, I can speak Spanish and you can't and I'm</br>   already learning French,&quot; because I took French classes. &quot;You don't even -&quot;</br>   Things like that. It was just more like bullies trying to be a bully.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Not really a racist. I do remember when I was working in construction, we</br>   went to a chicken house to do a couple of jobs there. One of the guys, not</br>   my co-workers but one of the guys that I guess it was his property, he did</br>   say something that I got offended at. But at the same time, I said, &quot;Well,</br>   it's kind of real.&quot; He said that he had left out some shoes or boots out on</br>   the field and the next day that he went to go get them, they weren't there.</br>   He said, &quot;One of those Mexicans probably stole them.&quot; It was probably true</br>   because there were some people that did those activities, but at the same</br>   time you're not sure. What if it was one of your own guys? Or what if you</br>   misplaced them? I did get back at him. I remember getting some scissors and</br>   I started cutting all his fence. I just started cutting the wires like,</br>   &quot;Okay. Now you can really talk about it. Yes.&quot; I guess that was my form of</br>   defending myself. I don't think it was the best thing.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember that day I was crying back home. I said, &quot;How can people just, I</br>   don't know, how can they discriminate if really if we take out our skin,</br>   we're the same on the inside? We both have flesh and bone. We're going to</br>   bleed the same.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It doesn't matter where you're from. We're the</br>   same on the inside.&quot; I guess that was one of the few things because I</br>   worked with American people my whole life. They gave me jobs, they fed me,</br>   they would invite me into their house. Some people had pools, said, &quot;Hey,</br>   we're going to have a pool party and I want you to come because you're one</br>   of my workers.&quot; Christmas parties where the company invites the whole</br>   co-workers to eat. I don't think I felt it until that day and until I</br>   arrived to prison.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did anything bad happen to you in prison?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No. Actually I was well taken care of by those people. They always told me</br>   that if I ever need anything, I should just call them or walk up to them</br>   and they would try to take care of me because I was the youngest. Most of</br>   the people were in their late 20s, 50s and I was the only teenager. They</br>   were like, &quot;No, you don't belong here. We're going to take care of you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did your family visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They couldn't. They couldn't because they were illegal too, so they</br>   couldn't. They couldn't. I guess the only other way was to write letters. I</br>   never received any letter, but I do remember writing them. That was our</br>   freedom through writing letters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But you didn't receive any.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did they write you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Probably not. No, probably not. I think my dad said he did, but I never</br>   received it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you see your family again before you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I came back home. I came back home, and we fought my case, and my dad</br>   was actually locked up with me in county. He didn't go to prison like I</br>   did. He got out pretty quickly. I don't know why even. I'm not sure why. I</br>   don't know why I was the only person that was taken to prison. I don't</br>   know. Maybe they were just trying to prove a point. Then my dad came back</br>   to Mexico first. But I do remember meeting up with my family and then them</br>   telling us that we have to do something or we're going to keep getting</br>   those type of cases. Actually, my sister was sent to Mexico first. She</br>   didn't get any deportation. My mom sent her back to Mexico. She was only 15</br>   years old.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [49:44] Then my dad came back and then I was living with my mom. I guess</br>   that was one of the most difficult part of my life was being with my mom</br>   and watching her struggle because I couldn't really work because I didn't</br>   have the papers. She could because she also had an illegal name there. She</br>   wasn't working under her name. She had another person's papers. She was</br>   able to work, but instead of my dad helping her out, it was on her. Of</br>   course, she had car payments, rent, bills. That's when I saw and I said,</br>   &quot;Hey, I need to do something. If I stay here, all I am doing is causing my</br>   mom to spend more money.&quot; So, I told her, &quot;Hey, I think I'm going to go</br>   back.&quot; Then I came to Mexico. She still stayed there. She was probably</br>   there for 20 years. But she moved to a different city.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is she back now?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, she's back now. Yeah, she's been here for maybe five years, four</br>   years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   She stayed all by herself for another five years?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   For another– I had stayed for 13, she stayed there for another seven years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why didn't she come back?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   She was trying to make money so when she could come back, we would have</br>   something. She did do it because now she has a car. I guess that was it.</br>   But as my mom and dad got separated, they eventually divorced. It was hard</br>   on both of us, my sister and I. I did feel guilty because I thought that</br>   because of me being deported caused my mom to send my sister and it caused</br>   my parents to separate. I did feel bad about that. It was horrible because</br>   I felt like I was a bad person. I felt like it was my fault that my parents</br>   got divorced. I felt really bad.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [51:59] Then as I got older, maybe in my mid 20s or early on, when I was</br>   25, I learned that I had nothing to do with it. It was their choice.</br>   Recently, my mom came to visit here, and it was amazing because once again</br>   my whole family was sitting down at a table eating together. My mom has a</br>   boyfriend, my dad has a girlfriend, so I guess they put those issues aside</br>   as, &quot;Hey now, we're still family. It doesn't matter who's next to us. We're</br>   always going to be a family.&quot; This happened last month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It was like Christmas.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it was amazing. We all sat down at the same table to eat. I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, we can work this out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us about coming back. You said it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [53:02] Yeah. Maybe not coming back. I was really excited. I was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   yeah. I'm going to go back to Mexico and everything's going to go perfect</br>   because I'm Mexican.&quot; I came back and I tried to go to school. It was too</br>   expensive. I either had to work or study but I didn't have the money to</br>   study. I wanted to be a welder. I tried to do it here in Mexico, but they</br>   didn't pay at all. They didn't pay well at all. My uncle told me to become</br>   a teacher. I didn't want to, obviously. Who wants to be a teacher of other</br>   children? I saw the potential. All my cousins say, &quot;Hey, you teach me</br>   English because they're asking me at my job to have a percentage.&quot; Friends</br>   telling me, &quot;Hey, teach me English,&quot; or including meeting girls. They were</br>   like, &quot;Hey, you speak English? You should come teach me.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah. Why</br>   not?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was good for that part but at the same time I did feel discrimination by</br>   my own people because they were saying, &quot;Hey, you're American. What are you</br>   doing here?&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I'm Mexican. I was born here,&quot; because my Spanish</br>   wasn't good. Even still today it's not the best. They're like, &quot;You need to</br>   learn how to speak Spanish.&quot; I said, &quot;I do speak Spanish, just not as</br>   well.&quot; It's like, &quot;You need to learn how to speak English.&quot; My defense has</br>   always been like that, &quot;Yeah, okay, you too.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Should’ve spoken to them in French.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Yeah, and I didn't use it then, but I should have. But I did feel a</br>   cultural shock especially because, in Mexico City there's all kinds of</br>   people, all kinds of people. Of course, when I was in United States, I</br>   would hang out with people that listened to hip hop. That was it. I didn't</br>   really meet people that listened to metal music or reggae or things like</br>   that. I started going out with my cousin, he's a guitar player, so he</br>   started inviting me to his events. I would see different kinds of people.</br>   People with long hair, makeup on, all black. I thought it was pretty cool,</br>   like, &quot;Okay, they have their own identity.&quot; Then I would go into the reggae</br>   events and saw people with dreadlocks, different type of black style,</br>   including people that worship other– Not just Christianity but people that</br>   practice Buddhism or practice Satanism or things like that. I said, &quot;Wow.</br>   It's amazing.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to</br>   hip hop, like, &quot;Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.&quot;</br>   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that</br>   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,</br>   they say, &quot;No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; Those</br>   were the words. I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yes. The way you</br>   have tattoos, the way you dress. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; I</br>   said, &quot;What does that have to do with my knowledge? I'm probably smarter</br>   than that guy right there. What does that have to do with my knowledge?&quot;</br>   &quot;No.&quot; Because I had piercings also. Then it's, &quot;Because our image is not</br>   like that.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Every job I try to go get, it was like, &quot;No.&quot; I was shut down. I learned</br>   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started</br>   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go</br>   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's</br>   like, &quot;Wow. So, it was just all about image.&quot; If you look nice, they're</br>   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or</br>   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my</br>   advantage and said, &quot;Okay. I need to do something.&quot; That's when I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, maybe teaching is a good opportunity since everybody's asking.&quot; I</br>   started looking for schools.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then there was this one school that they said, &quot;Hey, I don't care how you</br>   look, just you do need to change some things, but I'm not asking you to</br>   completely change yourself. Just so that you can seem legit.&quot; I'm like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I can do that, I guess.&quot; I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,</br>   &quot;Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?&quot; I said, &quot;Why not? Maybe</br>   it could be better.&quot; So, I did change for that school, but then I realized</br>   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to</br>   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, &quot;No. I can't do that no more.</br>   I can't.&quot; Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's</br>   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.</br>   So, I said, &quot;No. I have to quit. I have to quit. I am getting paid well, I</br>   have everything I have because of that, but I can't lose my identity.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got out, and then I realized that I didn't have to be different. I could</br>   still be me, but I could act some way around certain people. Yeah, it was</br>   hard because I didn't want to, I didn't want to but I felt like I have to</br>   because if I didn't I wouldn't get what I wanted, or obtain what I would</br>   get. But I do feel bad for becoming, not a total prick, but I do remember</br>   saying, &quot;I don't know, don't buy from him because he's from the street,&quot; or</br>   &quot;Don't buy your groceries there because it's not a good store.&quot; Things like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is that becoming a prick or was that becoming more Mexican chi-chi?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Oh, okay. I kind of guess that. Like, &quot;Oh, I don't want to take the Metro</br>   because I'd rather take a taxi.&quot; Things like that. Because I was making</br>   more money and I could afford a taxi. I said, &quot;No, that's not me. My</br>   parents never taught me to be like that.&quot; That's why I left that school. It</br>   was a very big school, but they did practice Christianity. They kind of,</br>   not forced us, but they said, &quot;Hey, if you want to be part of this, you</br>   have to follow this, you have to come to our meetings, you have to come to</br>   our events.&quot; I guess that's what made me turn a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It didn't appeal to you, the Christianity?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't mind it, but if they're trying to force it on me, then I say– It</br>   could have been like other religions. I just feel like if they try to force</br>   something on me, I'll say, &quot;No. I'm sorry, but you can't do that.&quot; Because</br>   my parents, they're Catholic and my mom eventually became Christian because</br>   of her cousins in the United States. I had a lot of ideas. Once I arrived</br>   to Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, I don't want to be part of no religion. I do</br>   believe in God, but I don't want to be part of no religion.&quot; I guess that</br>   made me see things differently because there are lot of beggars in the</br>   street, and that school taught me to look at them differently. I didn't</br>   like that. Or when we had events, we all had to dress nice and everything.</br>   When we walk in the street to go to that event, we would see beggars in the</br>   street. My co-workers, they would look at them with, &quot;Ugh.&quot; I guess I</br>   started to do it the same just to be part of it. I realized, &quot;No. I'm</br>   wrong. I'm wrong for doing that. That person is just like me. He's also a</br>   human.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Speaking to my cousin helped me out a lot because he had other beliefs. He</br>   was more into the historic part of things rather than to look at it how it</br>   is. If he would talk about religion, he'd say, &quot;It's just a part of</br>   history. We're all the same. It doesn't matter if you follow this or that.</br>   We're still human.&quot; He made me realize that it doesn't matter what religion</br>   you are, you're still a human. When we're born, they say, &quot;Hey, he's born a</br>   human.&quot; They don't say, &quot;Hey, he's born a Christian,&quot; or &quot;He's born</br>   something.&quot; I guess he made me open my eyes towards that. That's when I</br>   realized that I have to leave that school so I wouldn't become something</br>   that I'm not. Now I don't discriminate no religion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Listening to you, it makes me think of the fact that you had this choice to</br>   leave. In prison, you didn't have a choice. To survive, you had to be with</br>   the Mexicans, you had to play that. But once you were here, you could</br>   exercise your free choice, right? Your free will.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. I could.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You described the prison where you had to be with the Mexicans because it</br>   was a question of life and death.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But here, you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't have to. I didn't have to. Right. Yeah, I guess that part has been</br>   struggling for me. I always think that there's a right and a wrong, but</br>   that's on both ends. What about the middle part? I don't want to be right</br>   nor wrong. I want to investigate first. I don't want people to tell me,</br>   &quot;Hey, you have to do this because it's the right thing.&quot; I would say, &quot;Hey,</br>   but you're not telling me what the bad thing is so how do I know what your</br>   right is also my right?&quot; I guess that becoming neutral to things because</br>   too much of one thing can also be bad. Not enough of another thing can also</br>   be bad. You have to always keep it in the middle, keep it neutral. There's</br>   no right or wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did you feel the Mexican government treats returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They don't care. They have no – They don't care. I guess now that we've</br>   become more, they're starting to look into it. But back then, they didn't</br>   care. Even if you're Mexican living here, they didn't care so why would</br>   they care about another person that hasn't been here? I don't think they</br>   care.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   If you were given a chance to talk to them and to say, &quot;You should care,&quot;</br>   do you think they should care?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't think they should care.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't think I would want to sit and talk to them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why do you think they should care? What's the argument? Why do they have it</br>   wrong?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Because we're a big community. If they want our vote, they need to start to</br>   care. A lot of us, it's going to be either the first or second time that we</br>   vote. They have to start caring and start to look into our community</br>   because we're also Mexican, but we're not Mexican from here, we're Mexican</br>   from another place. They should care because if they want our vote, they</br>   should also start looking into that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Do you think you bring special skills that they're missing?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. Yes. English. Mexico is – I hear they want to make Mexico in the next</br>   20 years to become bilingual. They can't do that without us. They can't.</br>   They can try, but it's like learning Spanish in the United States. You'll</br>   learn it, but you're not going to learn Spanish like we do in Mexico. We</br>   have that. We have both Spanish from here and both English from there. They</br>   should start to look into that. I don't know how to answer that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about your education?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   That, too. I feel like a lot of us that have come back, we don't have that</br>   opportunity to continue our education because we don't have the money. We</br>   don't have – Including just to get your ID here, you go through a lot. You</br>   have to take a lot of documents that you don't even know if you have. A lot</br>   of people that came back, they don't even know what Mexico is like. Even</br>   trying to get an education, what are we going to study? What career can we</br>   make, or can we select to become part of a helpful community? My best guess</br>   is languages, not only English but other languages like French or German. I</br>   think if we want to be a first world country, we have to act like it.</br>   That's where our government is not putting its full potential because we do</br>   have the resources, but they're so corrupted that they'd rather keep that</br>   to themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about values?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Values?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Do you think that growing up in the U.S. you come back with certain</br>   values?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Now that you mentioned it, yes, we do bring a lot of values, especially in</br>   the cleanliness. In Mexico City, everybody's accustomed to whenever they</br>   finish their package of whatever food they have, they just throw it on the</br>   floor. Not everybody, of course, but most of the people do that. Us,</br>   growing up in the States, we know that that's a horrible thing. Like, &quot;You</br>   shouldn't do that. What type of person are you?&quot; You know? That's one</br>   thing. Cleanliness. We bring that. Being independent. Over there in the</br>   United States, when you're 18 like most of the people that turn 18, they</br>   get to live in their own apartment, have their own car. Here in Mexico, of</br>   course we can't afford it. Sometimes we're 25 and we still live with our</br>   parents and we still have to give them some type of expense. Maybe that.</br>   Being independent.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember my cousins telling me when I was only 18, and I was trying to</br>   have my own apartment already. They're like, &quot;Why? Why? You should just</br>   live with your dad.&quot; I'd go, &quot;No. I want to have my own room. I want to</br>   have my own kitchen.&quot; They're like, &quot;No, don't worry about that. You can</br>   just ...&quot; I don't know. I guess we're more attached in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that you come back with certain values that are</br>   different?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Some of us. Not all of them. Not all of us. But I think if we gather</br>   together and separate our difference, then yeah. I think it's possible. It</br>   maybe is going to take a long time because even here in Mexico we tend…</br>   Let's just say in Mexico, él que no transa, no avanza.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   No transa, no avanza?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. Do you know what that means?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. If you don't transact, you don't make it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't negotiate.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Exactly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Make, connect, whatever, pay off.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe if we stop thinking like that, because like I said, if you enter a</br>   system that they're going to pull you in. Maybe if we stop thinking like</br>   that and say, &quot;Hey, I'm not doing this for me, I'm doing this for all of</br>   us,&quot; the next person can say the same thing. He can influence another</br>   person to think the same thing because I think that here in Mexico, it's</br>   all about what I can do for myself, not really for others. Maybe if we</br>   change just a little bit on how we think, then maybe we could. Maybe we're</br>   the ones that need to plant the seeds so that the next generations could do</br>   it. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Do you feel Mexican or American or both?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I've always been asked that question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   I know.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I always say, &quot;I can be more Mexican because I love history and I love</br>   studying about my culture here as a Mexican. I know more than the average</br>   person does about Mexico.&quot; Then they question me about, &quot;How is it like to</br>   be an American?&quot; I have that answer also. But now-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What's that answer?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Now I don't want to be a nationality. I want to be a human. If aliens from</br>   different planet come, they're going to be, &quot;Oh, wait, not the Mexicans</br>   because they're cool. Not the Americans.&quot; No, they're going to say, &quot;Hey,</br>   all of you are humans and we're going to take over.&quot; I hope it never</br>   happens, but I don't think I want to be Mexican. I don't think I want to be</br>   American. I just want to be human. I think because if we are placed in that</br>   category of just a nationality, then it reduces everything because people</br>   categorize. Even in movies, they say, &quot;Best Mexican actor,&quot; or something</br>   like that. Like, &quot;No. He's an actor or an actress. He or she shouldn't be</br>   categorized as best Mexican or best Hispanic. They're humans. They have the</br>   talent just like anybody else.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   <span id="ea9bbafb-a3d8-4b60-a94e-73f8cf7b47b7" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Identity">I don't want to say that I'm Mexican or American.

   I live it. I guess this is the street slang. We always use different<br>
   vocabulary than the ones they use just to be different, I guess. We have<br>
   our own lingo. We definitely want to represent. It's not like we're hiding<br>
   or anything, but we want to also express ourselves to our full potential. I<br>
   think that's one of the best ways. I got into the hip hop culture as a very<br>
   young child, so I knew that there was graffiti, there was music, there was<br>
   rapping, there was break dancing. We took that, and we placed our own<br>
   little bits of ourselves into it. I guess that's where it comes from. I've<br>
   heard immigrant. In school, I remember in elementary school, we were, there<br>
   was a class called ESL.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sylent:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   They would call us migrant students. And I didn't understand what it was<br>
   until I grew older and started looking at the vocabulary. I saw that it<br>
   could be you know, an alien. I said, &quot;Yes, we are aliens. We're from a<br>
   different planet called Mexico.&quot; I guess that's how it started and just<br>
   people picking on us that we're illegal, &quot;Go back to your country,&quot; and<br>
   things like that. We definitely wanted to make that statement. Like, &quot;Yes,<br>
   we are illegal. So what?&quot; That's how it started.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Well, since I learned that I was living illegally in the United States, I<br>
   got discriminated for that. They would call me “illegal Mexican.” So I took<br>
   that as a positive thing and said, &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; and I felt like I needed to<br>
   represent that not just for myself but for a whole generation because<br>
   there's a lot of people just like me whose parents took them to the United<br>
   States, and they struggled through the same thing. I felt that I needed to<br>
   represent them. I didn't get the tattoos until I came back to Mexico.<br>
   That's how it started. I do remember in high school, most of my friends<br>
   that I hung out with were all Mexican, we were all born in Mexico. I guess<br>
   that's how it started, just hanging out with friends and making jokes about<br>
   it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sylent:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Eventually it became something that we represented. Other people knew that<br>
   we were illegal so we took that another step and we said, &quot;Yes. Yes, we<br>
   are. We are illegal aliens. We are, but we're also Americans. We share the<br>
   same traditions, we celebrate Thanksgiving, we celebrate the 4th of July.&quot;<br>
   We had to be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the<br>
   Americans. That's how it started.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Let me ask you a question about that because I've thought about that in the</br>   past year or so of this work. That everybody who we talk to in your</br>   situation, describes themselves as being illegal. And ee who consider</br>   ourselves pro-migrant, et cetera, we use all these other words. Right?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Right.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   We don't say illegal. We say, &quot;undocumented,&quot; or, &quot;unauthorized,&quot; or</br>   whatever. Why do you guys describe yourselves as illegal? Why do we</br>   describe you -- we jump through all this stuff. How does that sound to you?</br>   It's something I've been thinking about.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess it's the-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You're literally wearing it on your sleeve.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I live it. I guess this is the street slang. We always use different</br>   vocabulary than the ones they use just to be different, I guess. We have</br>   our own lingo. We definitely want to represent. It's not like we're hiding</br>   or anything, but we want to also express ourselves to our full potential. I</br>   think that's one of the best ways.

We took that, and we placed our own</br>   little bits of ourselves into it. I guess that's where it comes from. I've</br>   heard immigrant. In school, I remember in elementary school, we were, there</br>   was a class called ESL.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They would call us migrant students. And I didn't understand what it was</br>   until I grew older and started looking at the vocabulary. I saw that it</br>   could be you know, an alien. I said, &quot;Yes, we are aliens. We're from a</br>   different planet called Mexico.&quot; I guess that's how it started and just</br>   people picking on us that we're illegal, &quot;Go back to your country,&quot; and</br>   things like that. We definitely wanted to make that statement. Like, &quot;Yes,</br>   we are illegal. So what?&quot; That's how it started.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   A couple things with that. You said that you didn't know that you were</br>   illegal, though.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When did you discover that you weren't? Did you have American friends?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes, of course. My grandfather was originally born in Texas. He came to</br>   Mexico when he was only seven years old. I didn't know I was illegal</br>   because I thought that my family had moved to a different part of the</br>   planet. I didn't think it was a bad thing. Of course, you see in the news,</br>   you start seeing people getting deported. I didn't understand it, but I</br>   somehow thought I was. I never asked my parents about it. We never really</br>   spoke about it. All my friends, of course, they were American. My neighbors</br>   were American. I guess in high school, maybe that's when it started up. I</br>   started investigating because there was, how do you call it, marchas?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Protests.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Protests. I would see on TV students stepping out. I said, &quot;Hey, I think I</br>   should be doing that. I'm not sure.&quot; Then once I just got pulled over and I</br>   said, &quot;Oh, I'm American. I've been here my whole life. I have my</br>   documents.&quot; They actually told me, &quot;Well, you're right about some things,</br>   but wrong about different things. Yes, you have been here your whole life,</br>   but you didn't cross legally into the States. That's why” I said, &quot;Oh,</br>   okay. So, we are illegal.&quot; That's when I confirmed it, I guess. In the back</br>   of my mind, I thought I was, but I never actually officially heard it or</br>   knew about it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then after high school, when I got pulled over, they brought me to county</br>   and took me to prison. I said, &quot;Okay, so it's real. I am illegal.&quot; Then</br>   after I fought my case and I came back out, that's when I really started to</br>   say, &quot;Okay, yes, I am illegal. I am undocumented and I need to do something</br>   about it.&quot; I guess back then the easiest way was to get married with</br>   someone and they could fix you up. But I was 18 years old. I said, &quot;No, I'd</br>   rather go back to Mexico.&quot; At the same time, I wanted to learn about my</br>   culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   When they pulled you over, what did they pull you over for?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was like a checkup. It was a checkpoint.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   A checkpoint.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. It was just a checkpoint. That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did they treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess that first police officer, he was normal about it. He was like,</br>   &quot;I'm just doing my job. You have to go here.&quot; Then once I got actually</br>   arrested, that's when things changed because they treated me like if I were</br>   an animal, or if I had done something really wrong. It wasn't the case. I</br>   did get in trouble like any normal kid. I don't know, maybe breaking</br>   something or with other guys playing in the street or fighting or things</br>   like that, but I don't know. I guess after I got arrested, and they put the</br>   handcuffs on me, that's when they started treating me like if I were a</br>   criminal. I said, &quot;Why? I didn't do anything. I was only seven years old</br>   when I crossed.&quot; But I thought I crossed like everybody does. I guess it</br>   was after I got arrested that I started seeing the real discrimination with</br>   the authorities. In school, maybe just a typical guy that says, &quot;Hey, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; I would fight back saying, &quot;Hey, you don't either</br>   because your ancestors are not even from America.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you say, &quot;My dad was born in Texas,&quot; My grandpa?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't know then until I came back to Mexico. I don't know. I don't think</br>   my parents were trying to hide that. I think they were just trying to live,</br>   to continue living. I found out a lot of things when I came back to Mexico.</br>   Yeah, it was hard at first. I think I am actually happy that I haven't,</br>   otherwise I wouldn't be the person that I am now. That's how it was.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But were you a member of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I knew people. The area where I lived there was all kinds of gangs. I did</br>   get affiliated. I didn't want to, but I guess I couldn't for some reason,</br>   or I did go out and hang out with them. I did do a lot of things that they</br>   did, but I never considered myself part of it. I thought I was just</br>   affiliated. I thought it was normal because everybody was doing it. Not</br>   only in my city but in other cities. I saw the TV, so I thought it was just</br>   something normal that teenagers went through and eventually they get back</br>   on track. I thought it was just part of being a teenager. I didn't really</br>   think I was, &quot;Oh, I want to be the biggest gang member in the world.&quot; I</br>   just thought, &quot;Oh, yeah, it's cool.&quot; I did want to be part of something,</br>   obviously. I didn't want to feel left out. I did have family members that</br>   did represent them more than that. I thought it was just normal.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I lived in Arkansas, so I remember a lot of people from California started</br>   coming in. A lot of people from Chicago started coming in. So, There was</br>   like a lot of activities going on. I just thought it was part of just being</br>   a normal teenager because including my, I don't want to discriminate, but</br>   my white friends, they were going through other things as well, so I was</br>   like, &quot;Oh, it's just this normal thing.&quot; My black friends, they were doing</br>   similar things, so I didn't think it was only Mexicans. I thought it was</br>   just in general.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What were your white friends and black friends doing that was the</br>   equivalent?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Well, graffiti. We used to love writing on the walls. Or, I don't know,</br>   smoking marijuana. Things like that. Not like damaging or killing people,</br>   nothing like that. But more like the lighter stuff. Especially my white</br>   friends, they were the ones that really had the marijuana. We didn't know</br>   where to get that. My black friends, well they were more into the hip hop</br>   and graffiti culture. So, I thought that was pretty cool, and I would go in</br>   the library and started just searching books about it. I said, &quot;Okay, it's</br>   normal.&quot; There were like what you call crews, depending on which area that</br>   you lived. For example, this is the Centro so all the little kids from the</br>   Centro would hang out and they would go compete with the people from uptown</br>   and things like that. I guess that was just it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then eventually it got more into music. Instead of fighting each other we</br>   would like rap and insult each other but in a more clever way. At the end</br>   of the day, &quot;Okay, you did good. I like what you said about them,&quot; or &quot;I</br>   like what you said about this.&quot; It's just part of the culture for me to</br>   grow like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Let me go back and then if you could talk a little bit more about the</br>   experience in detention, that would be important for us to know about it.</br>   When you grew up, did you see a lot of your parents? Were they working all</br>   the time? What was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess I grew up more with my grandma because she would go and come back.</br>   During summer, I would stay with my grandma more. Yeah, I did see my father</br>   a lot. Mostly my father. My mom was the one that was more time at her job</br>   because she became a supervisor of a company, so she had to be there most</br>   of the time. My father was just a construction worker so after a certain</br>   time, he can't work anymore because of the light. I grew up with my father</br>   a lot. My sister and I, he would take us to the park, take us swimming. I</br>   don't feel like I missed them too much. I always felt that we were a</br>   family. No, I don't think I got that experience. I do know of other friends</br>   that their parents were at work all day and he was by himself at the house.</br>   I was like, &quot;Hey, just come over here. You can come play at my house.&quot; We</br>   had a trampoline and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you celebrated both American and Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Well, January 6 is the Dia de los Santos Reyes Magos, so of course I wanted</br>   my toys. Then fourth of July was more like everybody doing firecrackers and</br>   of course I wanted to do that, too. When it was Dia de los Muertos, we</br>   celebrated a little bit different because we put an altar and we celebrate</br>   all our people who have passed away. Then the day before was Halloween, so</br>   we could dress up as whatever we wanted. Obviously, Christmas is both, but</br>   we mixed it because in the Mexican culture the Christmas is not only giving</br>   gifts, it's also doing, I don't know how you call them, when you go out and</br>   you sing songs, Christian songs-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Carols.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Carol songs or things like that. Instead of eating turkey, we ate Pozole.</br>   It was a little bit of both, of course.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tamales.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Tamales, yes. My parents had Chicano friends, they were third generation</br>   American, whose parents had moved there and they are already adults. Then</br>   their children were American, but they spoke Spanish. We had all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Which is your favorite holiday?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   My favorite holiday? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think, well, maybe every</br>   child's favorite holiday is Christmas because of the presents. I didn't</br>   really care about the presents. I cared more about everybody being there.</br>   Sometimes the whole family didn't see each other until the end of the year.</br>   I think that was the time where I really got to see all of my cousins or I</br>   really got to see my uncles. But a favorite holiday? I don't know, April</br>   Fool's maybe? [laughing] I could do a lot of pranks on people. I'm not</br>   sure. I don't think I had a favorite holiday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   One last question about this. There's a lot of people, and this was</br>   surprising too to us, talked about discrimination between Mexicans, illegal</br>   Mexicans, and Chicanos. Did you experience that?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe not, because I grew up as a Chicano. Maybe not that much. I do</br>   remember other people being discriminated because they were from Mexico but</br>   from provinces, so they got even more. They got called paisanos. They were</br>   darker skinned, so I did feel it, not me personally, but I did feel it for</br>   my peers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Because you were a city dude?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, well, the area where I lived wasn't a big city. It was like _______.</br>   It wasn't super big, but it wasn't small.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you weren't like people from the provinces, so you were considered</br>   Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. That's, I guess, because of the area where we lived. I don't know. I</br>   guess my parents always wanted us to live in the nicer area so I would hang</br>   out with people like that. Then, when I would go see my friends, they</br>   didn't have white neighbors they had Mexican neighbors or people from other</br>   countries. In the area where I lived, we were the only Mexicans in the</br>   area. I do remember my neighbors that were black, the person on the side,</br>   he was my middle school coach from PE classes. We grew up in a very nice</br>   area. We had a front yard, a back yard, we had a pool in the back, we had a</br>   trampoline, we had a swing. I guess that's why they were working all day so</br>   they could provide us with that type of lifestyle. I didn't really feel</br>   that personally, but I do remember other people discriminating. I don't</br>   want to say for lower class people, they did. They did get that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When you got arrested, what happened? You got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   Were you driving at the time or were you-</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I was driving. I was coming back from work. I had the truck. I had my</br>   father's truck. He had all the tools in the back, and I was just coming</br>   back from work. There was a checkpoint. I got pulled over. I had a</br>   permission that they give teenagers to drive. I remember giving that. Then</br>   they were asking me more questions and then I started getting nervous for</br>   some reason. Then they started questioning me, &quot;Hey, why are you so</br>   nervous?&quot; &quot;You're here. I don't know what you're trying to do.&quot; Then they</br>   took me into the, I don't know how to call it, separos, where they separate</br>   you from– There’s a glass window and they just put you in a room. They make</br>   you take off your shoes. It's like a cell, like a big cell. I do remember</br>   looking at people and they're like, &quot;Wow, man, these people really look</br>   bad. I'm just 18 years old. I'm just a child.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They detained me there. I was there for six hours. I remember not being fed</br>   until a police guy, I guess he was Hispanic, he asked me, &quot;Have you eaten?&quot;</br>   I said, &quot;No, I haven't.&quot; He went and got me some McDonald's. I do remember</br>   it was a long time, though. Then, they took me in to the county. I was in</br>   Arkansas. I went into _____________. Then that's whenever I said, &quot;Okay, so</br>   it's real.&quot; They put me into the outfit, it was an orange outfit. I was</br>   separated with other people. It was hard because I didn't know, I didn't</br>   understand like that. I said, &quot;Well, I don't think I can compare myself to</br>   them. They really are people who either hurt people or they’ve done</br>   damages. I don't think I have done that.&quot; I was in there with those people,</br>   so I guess they put me in the same category as those people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then they put us in a big cellblock, and they would ask me, &quot;Why are you</br>   here?&quot; I'd say, &quot;Just being illegal.&quot; And then I would ask them, &quot;Why are</br>   you here?&quot; &quot;Oh, first degree murder, armed robbery, possession of</br>   paraphernalia, drug trafficking.&quot; I was like, &quot;Wow. Well, I'm just</br>   illegal.&quot; They were like, &quot;Oh, don't worry. You're going to get out. You're</br>   not as bad as we are.&quot; I was like, &quot;I hope not.&quot; It was whites, blacks,</br>   from other nations, Mexican, Hispanic people. It was everybody mixed. I do</br>   remember people just being with each other. White people being with them,</br>   and black people being with them. I said, &quot;Why? Why can't we all just be</br>   together? It was like that at school, why can't it be here?&quot; But I guess I</br>   started learning that racism exists, and you have to either defend yourself</br>   or defend your people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember even defending a person from the Marshall Islands because a</br>   Mexican guy had taken his food. I said, &quot;Hey, man, don't take his food.</br>   That's all he got to eat.&quot; They were like, &quot;So, what, are you going to</br>   defend them now?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm just defending a person. He's just like</br>   us. We're all detained. We shouldn't be like that.&quot; But they got onto me</br>   and they said, &quot;Either you're with us or against us. If you're against us,</br>   we're more.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, I guess I can be with you guys,&quot; just for being</br>   scared. Then after that I was there for about a month. Then they took me to</br>   a real prison. I remember they asked us to do jobs like clean your cell,</br>   clean the bathrooms, and things like that. Again, I was only 18 years old.</br>   I didn't know why I was put in prison with those people. In there, yes, I</br>   met some people that really had done some really bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Was this a maximum security?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't know. I don't think it was maximum security, but it was a federal</br>   prison. I think it was called ____________ or something like that. I was</br>   there for a couple more months. It was the same thing in there. If you were</br>   Mexican, you had to be with Mexicans. There were people in there from</br>   Russia. There were people from all over the world. But it was a federal</br>   prison. I remember asking, &quot;Is this an immigration prison or is this a</br>   federal prison?&quot; &quot;No, it's both. We keep both immigrants and… you know&quot;</br>   Yeah, I did get scared a lot, especially with just being 18 years old and</br>   being with people who are either double my age or older. They really had</br>   gang tattoos all over their face. They had marks. They had a lot of things</br>   going on with them. I remember hearing stories that they did. I was like,</br>   &quot;Wow.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [43:33] They would ask me, &quot;So why are you in here for?&quot; I didn't want to</br>   lie because I didn't want to make them think that I was a bad person or</br>   like, &quot;Yeah, I'm hard, too.&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I'm just here because I'm</br>   illegal.&quot; Then I remember a group of Mexicans from Mexico City approaching</br>   me. It was like 18 people. They were like, &quot;So, why are you here?&quot; &quot;I'm</br>   just illegal.&quot; They put me in a room. I thought, I don't know, you hear a</br>   lot of stories that they're going to do to you. But they were actually –</br>   They had my back. It was like, &quot;You are our youngest guy here. Don't worry.</br>   We're going to take care of you. What do you need?&quot; They gave me food, they</br>   gave me clothing, they gave me sandals.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   These are inmates.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, inmates. They said, &quot;We're going to protect you but at the same time</br>   if you see something happening, you need to step up. It doesn't matter if</br>   your cellmate is white. If he goes out and harms another one of our guys,</br>   you have to step in. If not, we're going to step you out.&quot; Luckily nothing</br>   ever happened when I was in there. But it was drastically [unintelligible</br>   43:48]. It was a new experience for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You discovered racism in prison.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Real racism. In school you always hear people talking, but then the next</br>   day we're friends again. We have to be in the same class and do group</br>   activities. I guess now that I think about it, those kids, they were just</br>   acting what they would see on TV or what their parents taught them. But,</br>   yeah, once I got to prison, I guess I felt it more directly. During high</br>   school, it's just a normal shit talker saying, &quot;Hey, go back to Mexico, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; You can always defend yourself there, saying, &quot;Hey,</br>   you're not even from here neither, so what are you talking about?&quot; Or &quot;I</br>   could be more American than you. Ask me any question and I'll answer it</br>   just as well as you can.&quot; I guess that was our power was being able to</br>   speak English and say, &quot;Hey, I can speak Spanish and you can't and I'm</br>   already learning French,&quot; because I took French classes. &quot;You don't even -&quot;</br>   Things like that. It was just more like bullies trying to be a bully.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Not really a racist. I do remember when I was working in construction, we</br>   went to a chicken house to do a couple of jobs there. One of the guys, not</br>   my co-workers but one of the guys that I guess it was his property, he did</br>   say something that I got offended at. But at the same time, I said, &quot;Well,</br>   it's kind of real.&quot; He said that he had left out some shoes or boots out on</br>   the field and the next day that he went to go get them, they weren't there.</br>   He said, &quot;One of those Mexicans probably stole them.&quot; It was probably true</br>   because there were some people that did those activities, but at the same</br>   time you're not sure. What if it was one of your own guys? Or what if you</br>   misplaced them? I did get back at him. I remember getting some scissors and</br>   I started cutting all his fence. I just started cutting the wires like,</br>   &quot;Okay. Now you can really talk about it. Yes.&quot; I guess that was my form of</br>   defending myself. I don't think it was the best thing.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember that day I was crying back home. I said, &quot;How can people just, I</br>   don't know, how can they discriminate if really if we take out our skin,</br>   we're the same on the inside? We both have flesh and bone. We're going to</br>   bleed the same.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It doesn't matter where you're from. We're the</br>   same on the inside.&quot; I guess that was one of the few things because I</br>   worked with American people my whole life. They gave me jobs, they fed me,</br>   they would invite me into their house. Some people had pools, said, &quot;Hey,</br>   we're going to have a pool party and I want you to come because you're one</br>   of my workers.&quot; Christmas parties where the company invites the whole</br>   co-workers to eat. I don't think I felt it until that day and until I</br>   arrived to prison.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did anything bad happen to you in prison?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No. Actually I was well taken care of by those people. They always told me</br>   that if I ever need anything, I should just call them or walk up to them</br>   and they would try to take care of me because I was the youngest. Most of</br>   the people were in their late 20s, 50s and I was the only teenager. They</br>   were like, &quot;No, you don't belong here. We're going to take care of you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did your family visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They couldn't. They couldn't because they were illegal too, so they</br>   couldn't. They couldn't. I guess the only other way was to write letters. I</br>   never received any letter, but I do remember writing them. That was our</br>   freedom through writing letters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But you didn't receive any.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did they write you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Probably not. No, probably not. I think my dad said he did, but I never</br>   received it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you see your family again before you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I came back home. I came back home, and we fought my case, and my dad</br>   was actually locked up with me in county. He didn't go to prison like I</br>   did. He got out pretty quickly. I don't know why even. I'm not sure why. I</br>   don't know why I was the only person that was taken to prison. I don't</br>   know. Maybe they were just trying to prove a point. Then my dad came back</br>   to Mexico first. But I do remember meeting up with my family and then them</br>   telling us that we have to do something or we're going to keep getting</br>   those type of cases. Actually, my sister was sent to Mexico first. She</br>   didn't get any deportation. My mom sent her back to Mexico. She was only 15</br>   years old.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [49:44] Then my dad came back and then I was living with my mom. I guess</br>   that was one of the most difficult part of my life was being with my mom</br>   and watching her struggle because I couldn't really work because I didn't</br>   have the papers. She could because she also had an illegal name there. She</br>   wasn't working under her name. She had another person's papers. She was</br>   able to work, but instead of my dad helping her out, it was on her. Of</br>   course, she had car payments, rent, bills. That's when I saw and I said,</br>   &quot;Hey, I need to do something. If I stay here, all I am doing is causing my</br>   mom to spend more money.&quot; So, I told her, &quot;Hey, I think I'm going to go</br>   back.&quot; Then I came to Mexico. She still stayed there. She was probably</br>   there for 20 years. But she moved to a different city.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is she back now?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, she's back now. Yeah, she's been here for maybe five years, four</br>   years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   She stayed all by herself for another five years?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   For another– I had stayed for 13, she stayed there for another seven years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why didn't she come back?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   She was trying to make money so when she could come back, we would have</br>   something. She did do it because now she has a car. I guess that was it.</br>   But as my mom and dad got separated, they eventually divorced. It was hard</br>   on both of us, my sister and I. I did feel guilty because I thought that</br>   because of me being deported caused my mom to send my sister and it caused</br>   my parents to separate. I did feel bad about that. It was horrible because</br>   I felt like I was a bad person. I felt like it was my fault that my parents</br>   got divorced. I felt really bad.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [51:59] Then as I got older, maybe in my mid 20s or early on, when I was</br>   25, I learned that I had nothing to do with it. It was their choice.</br>   Recently, my mom came to visit here, and it was amazing because once again</br>   my whole family was sitting down at a table eating together. My mom has a</br>   boyfriend, my dad has a girlfriend, so I guess they put those issues aside</br>   as, &quot;Hey now, we're still family. It doesn't matter who's next to us. We're</br>   always going to be a family.&quot; This happened last month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It was like Christmas.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it was amazing. We all sat down at the same table to eat. I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, we can work this out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us about coming back. You said it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [53:02] Yeah. Maybe not coming back. I was really excited. I was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   yeah. I'm going to go back to Mexico and everything's going to go perfect</br>   because I'm Mexican.&quot; I came back and I tried to go to school. It was too</br>   expensive. I either had to work or study but I didn't have the money to</br>   study. I wanted to be a welder. I tried to do it here in Mexico, but they</br>   didn't pay at all. They didn't pay well at all. My uncle told me to become</br>   a teacher. I didn't want to, obviously. Who wants to be a teacher of other</br>   children? I saw the potential. All my cousins say, &quot;Hey, you teach me</br>   English because they're asking me at my job to have a percentage.&quot; Friends</br>   telling me, &quot;Hey, teach me English,&quot; or including meeting girls. They were</br>   like, &quot;Hey, you speak English? You should come teach me.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah. Why</br>   not?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was good for that part but at the same time I did feel discrimination by</br>   my own people because they were saying, &quot;Hey, you're American. What are you</br>   doing here?&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I'm Mexican. I was born here,&quot; because my Spanish</br>   wasn't good. Even still today it's not the best. They're like, &quot;You need to</br>   learn how to speak Spanish.&quot; I said, &quot;I do speak Spanish, just not as</br>   well.&quot; It's like, &quot;You need to learn how to speak English.&quot; My defense has</br>   always been like that, &quot;Yeah, okay, you too.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Should’ve spoken to them in French.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Yeah, and I didn't use it then, but I should have. But I did feel a</br>   cultural shock especially because, in Mexico City there's all kinds of</br>   people, all kinds of people. Of course, when I was in United States, I</br>   would hang out with people that listened to hip hop. That was it. I didn't</br>   really meet people that listened to metal music or reggae or things like</br>   that. I started going out with my cousin, he's a guitar player, so he</br>   started inviting me to his events. I would see different kinds of people.</br>   People with long hair, makeup on, all black. I thought it was pretty cool,</br>   like, &quot;Okay, they have their own identity.&quot; Then I would go into the reggae</br>   events and saw people with dreadlocks, different type of black style,</br>   including people that worship other– Not just Christianity but people that</br>   practice Buddhism or practice Satanism or things like that. I said, &quot;Wow.</br>   It's amazing.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to</br>   hip hop, like, &quot;Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.&quot;</br>   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that</br>   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,</br>   they say, &quot;No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; Those</br>   were the words. I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yes. The way you</br>   have tattoos, the way you dress. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; I</br>   said, &quot;What does that have to do with my knowledge? I'm probably smarter</br>   than that guy right there. What does that have to do with my knowledge?&quot;</br>   &quot;No.&quot; Because I had piercings also. Then it's, &quot;Because our image is not</br>   like that.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Every job I try to go get, it was like, &quot;No.&quot; I was shut down. I learned</br>   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started</br>   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go</br>   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's</br>   like, &quot;Wow. So, it was just all about image.&quot; If you look nice, they're</br>   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or</br>   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my</br>   advantage and said, &quot;Okay. I need to do something.&quot; That's when I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, maybe teaching is a good opportunity since everybody's asking.&quot; I</br>   started looking for schools.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then there was this one school that they said, &quot;Hey, I don't care how you</br>   look, just you do need to change some things, but I'm not asking you to</br>   completely change yourself. Just so that you can seem legit.&quot; I'm like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I can do that, I guess.&quot; I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,</br>   &quot;Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?&quot; I said, &quot;Why not? Maybe</br>   it could be better.&quot; So, I did change for that school, but then I realized</br>   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to</br>   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, &quot;No. I can't do that no more.</br>   I can't.&quot; Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's</br>   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.</br>   So, I said, &quot;No. I have to quit. I have to quit. I am getting paid well, I</br>   have everything I have because of that, but I can't lose my identity.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got out, and then I realized that I didn't have to be different. I could</br>   still be me, but I could act some way around certain people. Yeah, it was</br>   hard because I didn't want to, I didn't want to but I felt like I have to</br>   because if I didn't I wouldn't get what I wanted, or obtain what I would</br>   get. But I do feel bad for becoming, not a total prick, but I do remember</br>   saying, &quot;I don't know, don't buy from him because he's from the street,&quot; or</br>   &quot;Don't buy your groceries there because it's not a good store.&quot; Things like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is that becoming a prick or was that becoming more Mexican chi-chi?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Oh, okay. I kind of guess that. Like, &quot;Oh, I don't want to take the Metro</br>   because I'd rather take a taxi.&quot; Things like that. Because I was making</br>   more money and I could afford a taxi. I said, &quot;No, that's not me. My</br>   parents never taught me to be like that.&quot; That's why I left that school. It</br>   was a very big school, but they did practice Christianity. They kind of,</br>   not forced us, but they said, &quot;Hey, if you want to be part of this, you</br>   have to follow this, you have to come to our meetings, you have to come to</br>   our events.&quot; I guess that's what made me turn a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It didn't appeal to you, the Christianity?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't mind it, but if they're trying to force it on me, then I say– It</br>   could have been like other religions. I just feel like if they try to force</br>   something on me, I'll say, &quot;No. I'm sorry, but you can't do that.&quot; Because</br>   my parents, they're Catholic and my mom eventually became Christian because</br>   of her cousins in the United States. I had a lot of ideas. Once I arrived</br>   to Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, I don't want to be part of no religion. I do</br>   believe in God, but I don't want to be part of no religion.&quot; I guess that</br>   made me see things differently because there are lot of beggars in the</br>   street, and that school taught me to look at them differently. I didn't</br>   like that. Or when we had events, we all had to dress nice and everything.</br>   When we walk in the street to go to that event, we would see beggars in the</br>   street. My co-workers, they would look at them with, &quot;Ugh.&quot; I guess I</br>   started to do it the same just to be part of it. I realized, &quot;No. I'm</br>   wrong. I'm wrong for doing that. That person is just like me. He's also a</br>   human.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Speaking to my cousin helped me out a lot because he had other beliefs. He</br>   was more into the historic part of things rather than to look at it how it</br>   is. If he would talk about religion, he'd say, &quot;It's just a part of</br>   history. We're all the same. It doesn't matter if you follow this or that.</br>   We're still human.&quot; He made me realize that it doesn't matter what religion</br>   you are, you're still a human. When we're born, they say, &quot;Hey, he's born a</br>   human.&quot; They don't say, &quot;Hey, he's born a Christian,&quot; or &quot;He's born</br>   something.&quot; I guess he made me open my eyes towards that. That's when I</br>   realized that I have to leave that school so I wouldn't become something</br>   that I'm not. Now I don't discriminate no religion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Listening to you, it makes me think of the fact that you had this choice to</br>   leave. In prison, you didn't have a choice. To survive, you had to be with</br>   the Mexicans, you had to play that. But once you were here, you could</br>   exercise your free choice, right? Your free will.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. I could.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You described the prison where you had to be with the Mexicans because it</br>   was a question of life and death.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But here, you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't have to. I didn't have to. Right. Yeah, I guess that part has been</br>   struggling for me. I always think that there's a right and a wrong, but</br>   that's on both ends. What about the middle part? I don't want to be right</br>   nor wrong. I want to investigate first. I don't want people to tell me,</br>   &quot;Hey, you have to do this because it's the right thing.&quot; I would say, &quot;Hey,</br>   but you're not telling me what the bad thing is so how do I know what your</br>   right is also my right?&quot; I guess that becoming neutral to things because</br>   too much of one thing can also be bad. Not enough of another thing can also</br>   be bad. You have to always keep it in the middle, keep it neutral. There's</br>   no right or wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did you feel the Mexican government treats returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They don't care. They have no – They don't care. I guess now that we've</br>   become more, they're starting to look into it. But back then, they didn't</br>   care. Even if you're Mexican living here, they didn't care so why would</br>   they care about another person that hasn't been here? I don't think they</br>   care.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   If you were given a chance to talk to them and to say, &quot;You should care,&quot;</br>   do you think they should care?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't think they should care.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't think I would want to sit and talk to them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why do you think they should care? What's the argument? Why do they have it</br>   wrong?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Because we're a big community. If they want our vote, they need to start to</br>   care. A lot of us, it's going to be either the first or second time that we</br>   vote. They have to start caring and start to look into our community</br>   because we're also Mexican, but we're not Mexican from here, we're Mexican</br>   from another place. They should care because if they want our vote, they</br>   should also start looking into that.

Mexico is – I hear they want to make Mexico in the next</br>   20 years to become bilingual. They can't do that without us. They can't.</br>   They can try, but it's like learning Spanish in the United States. You'll</br>   learn it, but you're not going to learn Spanish like we do in Mexico. We</br>   have that. We have both Spanish from here and both English from there. They</br>   should start to look into that. I don't know how to answer that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about your education?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   <span id="d9b52ffa-de5e-4a23-9ae6-96a4ee801c0d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Migrants, Return to Mexico, Challenges, Dead end, Lost opportunities, Language, Language, Lost opportunities, Mexico">That, too. I feel like a lot of us that have come back, we don't have that<br>
   opportunity to continue our education because we don't have the money. We<br>
   don't have – Including just to get your ID here, you go through a lot. You<br>
   have to take a lot of documents that you don't even know if you have. A lot<br>
   of people that came back, they don't even know what Mexico is like. Even<br>
   trying to get an education, what are we going to study? What career can we<br>
   make, or can we select to become part of a helpful community? My best guess<br>
   is languages, not only English but other languages like French or German. I<br>
   think if we want to be a first world country, we have to act like it.<br>
   That's where our government is not putting its full potential because we do<br>
   have the resources, but they're so corrupted that they'd rather keep that<br>
   to themselves.<br>

   would hang out with people that listened to hip hop. That was it. I didn't<br>
   really meet people that listened to metal music or reggae or things like<br>
   that. I started going out with my cousin, he's a guitar player, so he<br>
   started inviting me to his events. I would see different kinds of people.<br>
   People with long hair, makeup on, all black. I thought it was pretty cool,<br>

   my whole family was sitting down at a table eating together. My mom has a<br>

   Maybe not, because I grew up as a Chicano. Maybe not that much. I do<br>

   from provinces, so they got even more. They got called paisanos. They were<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Yes. That's, I guess, because of the area where we lived. I don't know. I<br>
   guess my parents always wanted us to live in the nicer area so I would hang<br>
   out with people like that. Then, when I would go see my friends, they<br>
   didn't have white neighbors they had Mexican neighbors or people from other<br>
   countries. In the area where I lived, we were the only Mexicans in the<br>
   area. I do remember my neighbors that were black, the person on the side,<br>
   he was my middle school coach from PE classes. We grew up in a very nice<br>
   area. We had a front yard, a back yard, we had a pool in the back, we had a<br>
   trampoline, we had a swing. I guess that's why they were working all day so<br>
   they could provide us with that type of lifestyle. I didn't really feel<br>
   that personally, but I do remember other people discriminating. I don't<br>
   want to say for lower class people, they did. They did get that.<br>

My mom was the one that was more time at her job</br>   because she became a supervisor of a company, so she had to be there most</br>   of the time.

Then fourth of July was more like everybody doing firecrackers and</br>   of course I wanted to do that, too. When it was Dia de los Muertos, we</br>   celebrated a little bit different because we put an altar and we celebrate</br>   all our people who have passed away. Then the day before was Halloween, so</br>   we could dress up as whatever we wanted. Obviously, Christmas is both, but</br>   we mixed it because in the Mexican culture the Christmas is not only giving</br>   gifts, it's also doing, I don't know how you call them, when you go out and</br>   you sing songs, Christian songs-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Carols.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Carol songs or things like that.

I think, well, maybe every</br>   child's favorite holiday is Christmas because of the presents. I didn't</br>   really care about the presents. I cared more about everybody being there.</br>   Sometimes the whole family didn't see each other until the end of the year.</br>   I think that was the time where I really got to see all of my cousins or I</br>   really got to see my uncles.

I don't think I had a favorite holiday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   One last question about this. There's a lot of people, and this was</br>   surprising too to us, talked about discrimination between Mexicans, illegal</br>   Mexicans, and Chicanos. Did you experience that?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe not, because I grew up as a Chicano. Maybe not that much. I do</br>   remember other people being discriminated because they were from Mexico but</br>   from provinces, so they got even more. They got called paisanos. They were</br>   darker skinned, so I did feel it, not me personally, but I did feel it for</br>   my peers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Because you were a city dude?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, well, the area where I lived wasn't a big city. It was like _______.</br>   It wasn't super big, but it wasn't small.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you weren't like people from the provinces, so you were considered</br>   Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. That's, I guess, because of the area where we lived. I don't know. I</br>   guess my parents always wanted us to live in the nicer area so I would hang</br>   out with people like that. Then, when I would go see my friends, they</br>   didn't have white neighbors they had Mexican neighbors or people from other</br>   countries. In the area where I lived, we were the only Mexicans in the</br>   area. I do remember my neighbors that were black, the person on the side,</br>   he was my middle school coach from PE classes. We grew up in a very nice</br>   area. We had a front yard, a back yard, we had a pool in the back, we had a</br>   trampoline, we had a swing. I guess that's why they were working all day so</br>   they could provide us with that type of lifestyle. I didn't really feel</br>   that personally, but I do remember other people discriminating. I don't</br>   want to say for lower class people, they did. They did get that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When you got arrested, what happened? You got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   Were you driving at the time or were you-</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I was driving. I was coming back from work. I had the truck. I had my</br>   father's truck. He had all the tools in the back, and I was just coming</br>   back from work. There was a checkpoint. I got pulled over. I had a</br>   permission that they give teenagers to drive. I remember giving that. Then</br>   they were asking me more questions and then I started getting nervous for</br>   some reason. Then they started questioning me, &quot;Hey, why are you so</br>   nervous?&quot; &quot;You're here. I don't know what you're trying to do.&quot; Then they</br>   took me into the, I don't know how to call it, separos, where they separate</br>   you from– There’s a glass window and they just put you in a room. They make</br>   you take off your shoes. It's like a cell, like a big cell. I do remember</br>   looking at people and they're like, &quot;Wow, man, these people really look</br>   bad. I'm just 18 years old. I'm just a child.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They detained me there. I was there for six hours. I remember not being fed</br>   until a police guy, I guess he was Hispanic, he asked me, &quot;Have you eaten?&quot;</br>   I said, &quot;No, I haven't.&quot; He went and got me some McDonald's. I do remember</br>   it was a long time, though. Then, they took me in to the county. I was in</br>   Arkansas. I went into _____________. Then that's whenever I said, &quot;Okay, so</br>   it's real.&quot; They put me into the outfit, it was an orange outfit. I was</br>   separated with other people. It was hard because I didn't know, I didn't</br>   understand like that. I said, &quot;Well, I don't think I can compare myself to</br>   them. They really are people who either hurt people or they’ve done</br>   damages. I don't think I have done that.&quot; I was in there with those people,</br>   so I guess they put me in the same category as those people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then they put us in a big cellblock, and they would ask me, &quot;Why are you</br>   here?&quot; I'd say, &quot;Just being illegal.&quot; And then I would ask them, &quot;Why are</br>   you here?&quot; &quot;Oh, first degree murder, armed robbery, possession of</br>   paraphernalia, drug trafficking.&quot; I was like, &quot;Wow. Well, I'm just</br>   illegal.&quot; They were like, &quot;Oh, don't worry. You're going to get out. You're</br>   not as bad as we are.&quot; I was like, &quot;I hope not.&quot; It was whites, blacks,</br>   from other nations, Mexican, Hispanic people. It was everybody mixed. I do</br>   remember people just being with each other. White people being with them,</br>   and black people being with them. I said, &quot;Why? Why can't we all just be</br>   together? It was like that at school, why can't it be here?&quot; But I guess I</br>   started learning that racism exists, and you have to either defend yourself</br>   or defend your people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember even defending a person from the Marshall Islands because a</br>   Mexican guy had taken his food. I said, &quot;Hey, man, don't take his food.</br>   That's all he got to eat.&quot; They were like, &quot;So, what, are you going to</br>   defend them now?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm just defending a person. He's just like</br>   us. We're all detained. We shouldn't be like that.&quot; But they got onto me</br>   and they said, &quot;Either you're with us or against us. If you're against us,</br>   we're more.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, I guess I can be with you guys,&quot; just for being</br>   scared. Then after that I was there for about a month. Then they took me to</br>   a real prison. I remember they asked us to do jobs like clean your cell,</br>   clean the bathrooms, and things like that. Again, I was only 18 years old.</br>   I didn't know why I was put in prison with those people. In there, yes, I</br>   met some people that really had done some really bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Was this a maximum security?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't know. I don't think it was maximum security, but it was a federal</br>   prison. I think it was called ____________ or something like that. I was</br>   there for a couple more months. It was the same thing in there. If you were</br>   Mexican, you had to be with Mexicans. There were people in there from</br>   Russia. There were people from all over the world. But it was a federal</br>   prison. I remember asking, &quot;Is this an immigration prison or is this a</br>   federal prison?&quot; &quot;No, it's both. We keep both immigrants and… you know&quot;</br>   Yeah, I did get scared a lot, especially with just being 18 years old and</br>   being with people who are either double my age or older. They really had</br>   gang tattoos all over their face. They had marks. They had a lot of things</br>   going on with them. I remember hearing stories that they did. I was like,</br>   &quot;Wow.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [43:33] They would ask me, &quot;So why are you in here for?&quot; I didn't want to</br>   lie because I didn't want to make them think that I was a bad person or</br>   like, &quot;Yeah, I'm hard, too.&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I'm just here because I'm</br>   illegal.&quot; Then I remember a group of Mexicans from Mexico City approaching</br>   me. It was like 18 people. They were like, &quot;So, why are you here?&quot; &quot;I'm</br>   just illegal.&quot; They put me in a room. I thought, I don't know, you hear a</br>   lot of stories that they're going to do to you. But they were actually –</br>   They had my back. It was like, &quot;You are our youngest guy here. Don't worry.</br>   We're going to take care of you. What do you need?&quot; They gave me food, they</br>   gave me clothing, they gave me sandals.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   These are inmates.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, inmates. They said, &quot;We're going to protect you but at the same time</br>   if you see something happening, you need to step up. It doesn't matter if</br>   your cellmate is white. If he goes out and harms another one of our guys,</br>   you have to step in. If not, we're going to step you out.&quot; Luckily nothing</br>   ever happened when I was in there. But it was drastically [unintelligible</br>   43:48]. It was a new experience for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You discovered racism in prison.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Real racism. In school you always hear people talking, but then the next</br>   day we're friends again. We have to be in the same class and do group</br>   activities. I guess now that I think about it, those kids, they were just</br>   acting what they would see on TV or what their parents taught them. But,</br>   yeah, once I got to prison, I guess I felt it more directly. During high</br>   school, it's just a normal shit talker saying, &quot;Hey, go back to Mexico, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; You can always defend yourself there, saying, &quot;Hey,</br>   you're not even from here neither, so what are you talking about?&quot; Or &quot;I</br>   could be more American than you. Ask me any question and I'll answer it</br>   just as well as you can.&quot; I guess that was our power was being able to</br>   speak English and say, &quot;Hey, I can speak Spanish and you can't and I'm</br>   already learning French,&quot; because I took French classes. &quot;You don't even -&quot;</br>   Things like that. It was just more like bullies trying to be a bully.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Not really a racist. I do remember when I was working in construction, we</br>   went to a chicken house to do a couple of jobs there. One of the guys, not</br>   my co-workers but one of the guys that I guess it was his property, he did</br>   say something that I got offended at. But at the same time, I said, &quot;Well,</br>   it's kind of real.&quot; He said that he had left out some shoes or boots out on</br>   the field and the next day that he went to go get them, they weren't there.</br>   He said, &quot;One of those Mexicans probably stole them.&quot; It was probably true</br>   because there were some people that did those activities, but at the same</br>   time you're not sure. What if it was one of your own guys? Or what if you</br>   misplaced them? I did get back at him. I remember getting some scissors and</br>   I started cutting all his fence. I just started cutting the wires like,</br>   &quot;Okay. Now you can really talk about it. Yes.&quot; I guess that was my form of</br>   defending myself. I don't think it was the best thing.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember that day I was crying back home. I said, &quot;How can people just, I</br>   don't know, how can they discriminate if really if we take out our skin,</br>   we're the same on the inside? We both have flesh and bone. We're going to</br>   bleed the same.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It doesn't matter where you're from. We're the</br>   same on the inside.&quot; I guess that was one of the few things because I</br>   worked with American people my whole life. They gave me jobs, they fed me,</br>   they would invite me into their house. Some people had pools, said, &quot;Hey,</br>   we're going to have a pool party and I want you to come because you're one</br>   of my workers.&quot; Christmas parties where the company invites the whole</br>   co-workers to eat. I don't think I felt it until that day and until I</br>   arrived to prison.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did anything bad happen to you in prison?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No. Actually I was well taken care of by those people. They always told me</br>   that if I ever need anything, I should just call them or walk up to them</br>   and they would try to take care of me because I was the youngest. Most of</br>   the people were in their late 20s, 50s and I was the only teenager. They</br>   were like, &quot;No, you don't belong here. We're going to take care of you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did your family visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They couldn't. They couldn't because they were illegal too, so they</br>   couldn't. They couldn't. I guess the only other way was to write letters. I</br>   never received any letter, but I do remember writing them. That was our</br>   freedom through writing letters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But you didn't receive any.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did they write you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Probably not. No, probably not. I think my dad said he did, but I never</br>   received it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you see your family again before you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I came back home. I came back home, and we fought my case, and my dad</br>   was actually locked up with me in county. He didn't go to prison like I</br>   did. He got out pretty quickly. I don't know why even. I'm not sure why. I</br>   don't know why I was the only person that was taken to prison. I don't</br>   know. Maybe they were just trying to prove a point. Then my dad came back</br>   to Mexico first. But I do remember meeting up with my family and then them</br>   telling us that we have to do something or we're going to keep getting</br>   those type of cases. Actually, my sister was sent to Mexico first. She</br>   didn't get any deportation. My mom sent her back to Mexico. She was only 15</br>   years old.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [49:44] Then my dad came back and then I was living with my mom. I guess</br>   that was one of the most difficult part of my life was being with my mom</br>   and watching her struggle because I couldn't really work because I didn't</br>   have the papers. She could because she also had an illegal name there. She</br>   wasn't working under her name. She had another person's papers. She was</br>   able to work, but instead of my dad helping her out, it was on her. Of</br>   course, she had car payments, rent, bills. That's when I saw and I said,</br>   &quot;Hey, I need to do something. If I stay here, all I am doing is causing my</br>   mom to spend more money.&quot; So, I told her, &quot;Hey, I think I'm going to go</br>   back.&quot; Then I came to Mexico. She still stayed there. She was probably</br>   there for 20 years. But she moved to a different city.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is she back now?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, she's back now. Yeah, she's been here for maybe five years, four</br>   years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   She stayed all by herself for another five years?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   For another– I had stayed for 13, she stayed there for another seven years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why didn't she come back?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   She was trying to make money so when she could come back, we would have</br>   something. She did do it because now she has a car. I guess that was it.</br>   But as my mom and dad got separated, they eventually divorced. It was hard</br>   on both of us, my sister and I. I did feel guilty because I thought that</br>   because of me being deported caused my mom to send my sister and it caused</br>   my parents to separate. I did feel bad about that. It was horrible because</br>   I felt like I was a bad person. I felt like it was my fault that my parents</br>   got divorced. I felt really bad.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [51:59] Then as I got older, maybe in my mid 20s or early on, when I was</br>   25, I learned that I had nothing to do with it. It was their choice.</br>   Recently, my mom came to visit here, and it was amazing because once again</br>   my whole family was sitting down at a table eating together. My mom has a</br>   boyfriend, my dad has a girlfriend, so I guess they put those issues aside</br>   as, &quot;Hey now, we're still family. It doesn't matter who's next to us. We're</br>   always going to be a family.&quot; This happened last month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It was like Christmas.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it was amazing. We all sat down at the same table to eat. I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, we can work this out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us about coming back. You said it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [53:02] Yeah. Maybe not coming back. I was really excited. I was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   yeah. I'm going to go back to Mexico and everything's going to go perfect</br>   because I'm Mexican.&quot; I came back and I tried to go to school. It was too</br>   expensive. I either had to work or study but I didn't have the money to</br>   study. I wanted to be a welder. I tried to do it here in Mexico, but they</br>   didn't pay at all. They didn't pay well at all. My uncle told me to become</br>   a teacher. I didn't want to, obviously. Who wants to be a teacher of other</br>   children? I saw the potential. All my cousins say, &quot;Hey, you teach me</br>   English because they're asking me at my job to have a percentage.&quot; Friends</br>   telling me, &quot;Hey, teach me English,&quot; or including meeting girls. They were</br>   like, &quot;Hey, you speak English? You should come teach me.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah. Why</br>   not?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was good for that part but at the same time I did feel discrimination by</br>   my own people because they were saying, &quot;Hey, you're American. What are you</br>   doing here?&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I'm Mexican. I was born here,&quot; because my Spanish</br>   wasn't good. Even still today it's not the best. They're like, &quot;You need to</br>   learn how to speak Spanish.&quot; I said, &quot;I do speak Spanish, just not as</br>   well.&quot; It's like, &quot;You need to learn how to speak English.&quot; My defense has</br>   always been like that, &quot;Yeah, okay, you too.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Should’ve spoken to them in French.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Yeah, and I didn't use it then, but I should have. But I did feel a</br>   cultural shock especially because, in Mexico City there's all kinds of</br>   people, all kinds of people. Of course, when I was in United States, I</br>   would hang out with people that listened to hip hop. That was it. I didn't</br>   really meet people that listened to metal music or reggae or things like</br>   that. I started going out with my cousin, he's a guitar player, so he</br>   started inviting me to his events. I would see different kinds of people.</br>   People with long hair, makeup on, all black. I thought it was pretty cool,</br>   like, &quot;Okay, they have their own identity.&quot; Then I would go into the reggae</br>   events and saw people with dreadlocks, different type of black style,</br>   including people that worship other– Not just Christianity but people that</br>   practice Buddhism or practice Satanism or things like that. I said, &quot;Wow.</br>   It's amazing.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to</br>   hip hop, like, &quot;Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.&quot;</br>   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that</br>   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,</br>   they say, &quot;No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; Those</br>   were the words. I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yes. The way you</br>   have tattoos, the way you dress. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; I</br>   said, &quot;What does that have to do with my knowledge? I'm probably smarter</br>   than that guy right there. What does that have to do with my knowledge?&quot;</br>   &quot;No.&quot; Because I had piercings also. Then it's, &quot;Because our image is not</br>   like that.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Every job I try to go get, it was like, &quot;No.&quot; I was shut down. I learned</br>   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started</br>   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go</br>   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's</br>   like, &quot;Wow. So, it was just all about image.&quot; If you look nice, they're</br>   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or</br>   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my</br>   advantage and said, &quot;Okay. I need to do something.&quot; That's when I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, maybe teaching is a good opportunity since everybody's asking.&quot; I</br>   started looking for schools.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then there was this one school that they said, &quot;Hey, I don't care how you</br>   look, just you do need to change some things, but I'm not asking you to</br>   completely change yourself. Just so that you can seem legit.&quot; I'm like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I can do that, I guess.&quot; I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,</br>   &quot;Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?&quot; I said, &quot;Why not? Maybe</br>   it could be better.&quot; So, I did change for that school, but then I realized</br>   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to</br>   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, &quot;No. I can't do that no more.</br>   I can't.&quot; Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's</br>   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.</br>   So, I said, &quot;No. I have to quit. I have to quit. I am getting paid well, I</br>   have everything I have because of that, but I can't lose my identity.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got out, and then I realized that I didn't have to be different. I could</br>   still be me, but I could act some way around certain people. Yeah, it was</br>   hard because I didn't want to, I didn't want to but I felt like I have to</br>   because if I didn't I wouldn't get what I wanted, or obtain what I would</br>   get. But I do feel bad for becoming, not a total prick, but I do remember</br>   saying, &quot;I don't know, don't buy from him because he's from the street,&quot; or</br>   &quot;Don't buy your groceries there because it's not a good store.&quot; Things like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is that becoming a prick or was that becoming more Mexican chi-chi?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Oh, okay. I kind of guess that. Like, &quot;Oh, I don't want to take the Metro</br>   because I'd rather take a taxi.&quot; Things like that. Because I was making</br>   more money and I could afford a taxi. I said, &quot;No, that's not me. My</br>   parents never taught me to be like that.&quot; That's why I left that school. It</br>   was a very big school, but they did practice Christianity. They kind of,</br>   not forced us, but they said, &quot;Hey, if you want to be part of this, you</br>   have to follow this, you have to come to our meetings, you have to come to</br>   our events.&quot; I guess that's what made me turn a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It didn't appeal to you, the Christianity?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't mind it, but if they're trying to force it on me, then I say– It</br>   could have been like other religions. I just feel like if they try to force</br>   something on me, I'll say, &quot;No. I'm sorry, but you can't do that.&quot; Because</br>   my parents, they're Catholic and my mom eventually became Christian because</br>   of her cousins in the United States. I had a lot of ideas. Once I arrived</br>   to Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, I don't want to be part of no religion. I do</br>   believe in God, but I don't want to be part of no religion.&quot; I guess that</br>   made me see things differently because there are lot of beggars in the</br>   street, and that school taught me to look at them differently. I didn't</br>   like that. Or when we had events, we all had to dress nice and everything.</br>   When we walk in the street to go to that event, we would see beggars in the</br>   street. My co-workers, they would look at them with, &quot;Ugh.&quot; I guess I</br>   started to do it the same just to be part of it. I realized, &quot;No. I'm</br>   wrong. I'm wrong for doing that. That person is just like me. He's also a</br>   human.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Speaking to my cousin helped me out a lot because he had other beliefs. He</br>   was more into the historic part of things rather than to look at it how it</br>   is. If he would talk about religion, he'd say, &quot;It's just a part of</br>   history. We're all the same. It doesn't matter if you follow this or that.</br>   We're still human.&quot; He made me realize that it doesn't matter what religion</br>   you are, you're still a human. When we're born, they say, &quot;Hey, he's born a</br>   human.&quot; They don't say, &quot;Hey, he's born a Christian,&quot; or &quot;He's born</br>   something.&quot; I guess he made me open my eyes towards that. That's when I</br>   realized that I have to leave that school so I wouldn't become something</br>   that I'm not. Now I don't discriminate no religion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Listening to you, it makes me think of the fact that you had this choice to</br>   leave. In prison, you didn't have a choice. To survive, you had to be with</br>   the Mexicans, you had to play that. But once you were here, you could</br>   exercise your free choice, right? Your free will.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. I could.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You described the prison where you had to be with the Mexicans because it</br>   was a question of life and death.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But here, you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't have to. I didn't have to. Right. Yeah, I guess that part has been</br>   struggling for me. I always think that there's a right and a wrong, but</br>   that's on both ends. What about the middle part? I don't want to be right</br>   nor wrong. I want to investigate first. I don't want people to tell me,</br>   &quot;Hey, you have to do this because it's the right thing.&quot; I would say, &quot;Hey,</br>   but you're not telling me what the bad thing is so how do I know what your</br>   right is also my right?&quot; I guess that becoming neutral to things because</br>   too much of one thing can also be bad. Not enough of another thing can also</br>   be bad. You have to always keep it in the middle, keep it neutral. There's</br>   no right or wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did you feel the Mexican government treats returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They don't care. They have no – They don't care. I guess now that we've</br>   become more, they're starting to look into it. But back then, they didn't</br>   care. Even if you're Mexican living here, they didn't care so why would</br>   they care about another person that hasn't been here? I don't think they</br>   care.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   If you were given a chance to talk to them and to say, &quot;You should care,&quot;</br>   do you think they should care?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't think they should care.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't think I would want to sit and talk to them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why do you think they should care? What's the argument? Why do they have it</br>   wrong?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Because we're a big community. If they want our vote, they need to start to</br>   care. A lot of us, it's going to be either the first or second time that we</br>   vote. They have to start caring and start to look into our community</br>   because we're also Mexican, but we're not Mexican from here, we're Mexican</br>   from another place. They should care because if they want our vote, they</br>   should also start looking into that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Do you think you bring special skills that they're missing?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. Yes. English. Mexico is – I hear they want to make Mexico in the next</br>   20 years to become bilingual. They can't do that without us. They can't.</br>   They can try, but it's like learning Spanish in the United States. You'll</br>   learn it, but you're not going to learn Spanish like we do in Mexico. We</br>   have that. We have both Spanish from here and both English from there. They</br>   should start to look into that. I don't know how to answer that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about your education?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   That, too. I feel like a lot of us that have come back, we don't have that</br>   opportunity to continue our education because we don't have the money. We</br>   don't have – Including just to get your ID here, you go through a lot. You</br>   have to take a lot of documents that you don't even know if you have. A lot</br>   of people that came back, they don't even know what Mexico is like. Even</br>   trying to get an education, what are we going to study? What career can we</br>   make, or can we select to become part of a helpful community? My best guess</br>   is languages, not only English but other languages like French or German. I</br>   think if we want to be a first world country, we have to act like it.</br>   That's where our government is not putting its full potential because we do</br>   have the resources, but they're so corrupted that they'd rather keep that</br>   to themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about values?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Values?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Do you think that growing up in the U.S. you come back with certain</br>   values?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Now that you mentioned it, yes, we do bring a lot of values, especially in</br>   the cleanliness. In Mexico City, everybody's accustomed to whenever they</br>   finish their package of whatever food they have, they just throw it on the</br>   floor. Not everybody, of course, but most of the people do that. Us,</br>   growing up in the States, we know that that's a horrible thing. Like, &quot;You</br>   shouldn't do that. What type of person are you?&quot; You know? That's one</br>   thing. Cleanliness. We bring that. Being independent. Over there in the</br>   United States, when you're 18 like most of the people that turn 18, they</br>   get to live in their own apartment, have their own car. Here in Mexico, of</br>   course we can't afford it. Sometimes we're 25 and we still live with our</br>   parents and we still have to give them some type of expense. Maybe that.</br>   Being independent.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember my cousins telling me when I was only 18, and I was trying to</br>   have my own apartment already. They're like, &quot;Why? Why? You should just</br>   live with your dad.&quot; I'd go, &quot;No. I want to have my own room. I want to</br>   have my own kitchen.&quot; They're like, &quot;No, don't worry about that. You can</br>   just ...&quot; I don't know. I guess we're more attached in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that you come back with certain values that are</br>   different?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Some of us. Not all of them. Not all of us. But I think if we gather</br>   together and separate our difference, then yeah. I think it's possible. It</br>   maybe is going to take a long time because even here in Mexico we tend…</br>   Let's just say in Mexico, él que no transa, no avanza.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   No transa, no avanza?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. Do you know what that means?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. If you don't transact, you don't make it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't negotiate.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Exactly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Make, connect, whatever, pay off.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe if we stop thinking like that, because like I said, if you enter a</br>   system that they're going to pull you in. Maybe if we stop thinking like</br>   that and say, &quot;Hey, I'm not doing this for me, I'm doing this for all of</br>   us,&quot; the next person can say the same thing. He can influence another</br>   person to think the same thing because I think that here in Mexico, it's</br>   all about what I can do for myself, not really for others. Maybe if we</br>   change just a little bit on how we think, then maybe we could. Maybe we're</br>   the ones that need to plant the seeds so that the next generations could do</br>   it. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Do you feel Mexican or American or both?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I've always been asked that question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   I know.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I always say, &quot;I can be more Mexican because I love history and I love</br>   studying about my culture here as a Mexican. I know more than the average</br>   person does about Mexico.&quot; Then they question me about, &quot;How is it like to</br>   be an American?&quot; I have that answer also. But now-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What's that answer?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   <span id="e0236cc4-370f-4148-97bc-6a639c5985db" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Identity, Global/Human">Now I don't want to be a nationality.

   happens, but I don't think I want to be Mexican. I don't think I want to be<br>
   American. I just want to be human. I think because if we are placed in that<br>
   category of just a nationality, then it reduces everything because people<br>
   categorize. Even in movies, they say, &quot;Best Mexican actor,&quot; or something<br>
   like that. Like, &quot;No. He's an actor or an actress. He or she shouldn't be<br>

   that was one of the most difficult part of my life was being with my mom<br>
   and watching her struggle because I couldn't really work because I didn't<br>
   have the papers. She could because she also had an illegal name there. She<br>
   wasn't working under her name. She had another person's papers. She was<br>
   able to work, but instead of my dad helping her out, it was on her. Of<br>
   course, she had car payments, rent, bills. That's when I saw and I said,<br>

   Illegal Mexican.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Yes.<br>

 <br>
   Where does that come from?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sylent:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Well, since I learned that I was living illegally in the United States, I<br>
   got discriminated for that. They would call me “illegal Mexican.” So I took<br>
   that as a positive thing and said, &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; and I felt like I needed to<br>
   represent that not just for myself but for a whole generation because<br>
   there's a lot of people just like me whose parents took them to the United<br>
   States, and they struggled through the same thing. I felt that I needed to<br>
   represent them.</span> I didn't get the tattoos until I came back to Mexico.</br>   That's how it started. I do remember in high school, most of my friends</br>   that I hung out with were all Mexican, we were all born in Mexico. I guess</br>   that's how it started, just hanging out with friends and making jokes about</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Eventually it became something that we represented. Other people knew that</br>   we were illegal so we took that another step and we said, &quot;Yes. Yes, we</br>   are. We are illegal aliens. We are, but we're also Americans. We share the</br>   same traditions, we celebrate Thanksgiving, we celebrate the 4th of July.&quot;</br>   We had to be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the</br>   Americans. That's how it started.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Let me ask you a question about that because I've thought about that in the</br>   past year or so of this work. That everybody who we talk to in your</br>   situation, describes themselves as being illegal. And ee who consider</br>   ourselves pro-migrant, et cetera, we use all these other words. Right?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Right.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   We don't say illegal. We say, &quot;undocumented,&quot; or, &quot;unauthorized,&quot; or</br>   whatever. Why do you guys describe yourselves as illegal? Why do we</br>   describe you -- we jump through all this stuff. How does that sound to you?</br>   It's something I've been thinking about.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess it's the-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You're literally wearing it on your sleeve.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I live it. I guess this is the street slang. We always use different</br>   vocabulary than the ones they use just to be different, I guess. We have</br>   our own lingo. We definitely want to represent. It's not like we're hiding</br>   or anything, but we want to also express ourselves to our full potential. I</br>   think that's one of the best ways. I got into the hip hop culture as a very</br>   young child, so I knew that there was graffiti, there was music, there was</br>   rapping, there was break dancing. We took that, and we placed our own</br>   little bits of ourselves into it. I guess that's where it comes from. I've</br>   heard immigrant. In school, I remember in elementary school, we were, there</br>   was a class called ESL.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They would call us migrant students. And I didn't understand what it was</br>   until I grew older and started looking at the vocabulary. I saw that it</br>   could be you know, an alien. I said, &quot;Yes, we are aliens. We're from a</br>   different planet called Mexico.&quot; I guess that's how it started and just</br>   people picking on us that we're illegal, &quot;Go back to your country,&quot; and</br>   things like that. We definitely wanted to make that statement. Like, &quot;Yes,</br>   we are illegal. So what?&quot; That's how it started.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   A couple things with that. You said that you didn't know that you were</br>   illegal, though.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When did you discover that you weren't? Did you have American friends?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes, of course. My grandfather was originally born in Texas. He came to</br>   Mexico when he was only seven years old. I didn't know I was illegal</br>   because I thought that my family had moved to a different part of the</br>   planet. I didn't think it was a bad thing. Of course, you see in the news,</br>   you start seeing people getting deported. I didn't understand it, but I</br>   somehow thought I was. I never asked my parents about it. We never really</br>   spoke about it. All my friends, of course, they were American. My neighbors</br>   were American. I guess in high school, maybe that's when it started up. I</br>   started investigating because there was, how do you call it, marchas?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Protests.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Protests. I would see on TV students stepping out. I said, &quot;Hey, I think I</br>   should be doing that. I'm not sure.&quot; Then once I just got pulled over and I</br>   said, &quot;Oh, I'm American. I've been here my whole life. I have my</br>   documents.&quot; They actually told me, &quot;Well, you're right about some things,</br>   but wrong about different things. Yes, you have been here your whole life,</br>   but you didn't cross legally into the States. That's why” I said, &quot;Oh,</br>   okay. So, we are illegal.&quot; That's when I confirmed it, I guess. In the back</br>   of my mind, I thought I was, but I never actually officially heard it or</br>   knew about it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then after high school, when I got pulled over, they brought me to county</br>   and took me to prison. I said, &quot;Okay, so it's real. I am illegal.&quot; Then</br>   after I fought my case and I came back out, that's when I really started to</br>   say, &quot;Okay, yes, I am illegal. I am undocumented and I need to do something</br>   about it.&quot; I guess back then the easiest way was to get married with</br>   someone and they could fix you up. But I was 18 years old. I said, &quot;No, I'd</br>   rather go back to Mexico.&quot; At the same time, I wanted to learn about my</br>   culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   When they pulled you over, what did they pull you over for?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was like a checkup. It was a checkpoint.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   A checkpoint.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. It was just a checkpoint. That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did they treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess that first police officer, he was normal about it. He was like,</br>   &quot;I'm just doing my job. You have to go here.&quot; Then once I got actually</br>   arrested, that's when things changed because they treated me like if I were</br>   an animal, or if I had done something really wrong. It wasn't the case. I</br>   did get in trouble like any normal kid. I don't know, maybe breaking</br>   something or with other guys playing in the street or fighting or things</br>   like that, but I don't know. I guess after I got arrested, and they put the</br>   handcuffs on me, that's when they started treating me like if I were a</br>   criminal. I said, &quot;Why? I didn't do anything. I was only seven years old</br>   when I crossed.&quot; But I thought I crossed like everybody does. I guess it</br>   was after I got arrested that I started seeing the real discrimination with</br>   the authorities. In school, maybe just a typical guy that says, &quot;Hey, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; I would fight back saying, &quot;Hey, you don't either</br>   because your ancestors are not even from America.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you say, &quot;My dad was born in Texas,&quot; My grandpa?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't know then until I came back to Mexico. I don't know. I don't think</br>   my parents were trying to hide that. I think they were just trying to live,</br>   to continue living. I found out a lot of things when I came back to Mexico.</br>   Yeah, it was hard at first. I think I am actually happy that I haven't,</br>   otherwise I wouldn't be the person that I am now. That's how it was.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But were you a member of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I knew people. <span id="8cf39344-6a55-4def-958b-d0423ae0cd7b" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Gangs, Affiliation, Gangs, Camaraderie/family, Fitting in, Gangs">The area where I lived there was all kinds of gangs.

   did, but I never considered myself part of it. I thought I was just<br>
   affiliated. I thought it was normal because everybody was doing it. Not<br>
   only in my city but in other cities. I saw the TV, so I thought it was just<br>
   something normal that teenagers went through and eventually they get back<br>
   on track. I thought it was just part of being a teenager. I didn't really<br>
   think I was, &quot;Oh, I want to be the biggest gang member in the world.&quot; I<br>
   just thought, &quot;Oh, yeah, it's cool.&quot; I did want to be part of something,<br>

  </span> Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you say, &quot;My dad was born in Texas,&quot; My grandpa?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't know then until I came back to Mexico. I don't know. I don't think</br>   my parents were trying to hide that. I think they were just trying to live,</br>   to continue living. I found out a lot of things when I came back to Mexico.</br>   Yeah, it was hard at first. I think I am actually happy that I haven't,</br>   otherwise I wouldn't be the person that I am now. That's how it was.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But were you a member of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I knew people. The area where I lived there was all kinds of gangs. I did</br>   get affiliated. I didn't want to, but I guess I couldn't for some reason,</br>   or I did go out and hang out with them. I did do a lot of things that they</br>   did, but I never considered myself part of it. I thought I was just</br>   affiliated. I thought it was normal because everybody was doing it.

I didn't want to feel left out. I did have family members that</br>   did represent them more than that. I thought it was just normal.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I lived in Arkansas, so I remember a lot of people from California started</br>   coming in. A lot of people from Chicago started coming in. So, There was</br>   like a lot of activities going on. I just thought it was part of just being</br>   a normal teenager because including my, I don't want to discriminate, but</br>   my white friends, they were going through other things as well, so I was</br>   like, &quot;Oh, it's just this normal thing.&quot; My black friends, they were doing</br>   similar things, so I didn't think it was only Mexicans. I thought it was</br>   just in general.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What were your white friends and black friends doing that was the</br>   equivalent?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Well, graffiti. We used to love writing on the walls. Or, I don't know,</br>   smoking marijuana. Things like that. Not like damaging or killing people,</br>   nothing like that. But more like the lighter stuff. Especially my white</br>   friends, they were the ones that really had the marijuana. We didn't know</br>   where to get that. My black friends, well they were more into the hip hop</br>   and graffiti culture. So, I thought that was pretty cool, and I would go in</br>   the library and started just searching books about it. I said, &quot;Okay, it's</br>   normal.&quot; There were like what you call crews, depending on which area that</br>   you lived. For example, this is the Centro so all the little kids from the</br>   Centro would hang out and they would go compete with the people from uptown</br>   and things like that. I guess that was just it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then eventually it got more into music. Instead of fighting each other we</br>   would like rap and insult each other but in a more clever way. At the end</br>   of the day, &quot;Okay, you did good. I like what you said about them,&quot; or &quot;I</br>   like what you said about this.&quot; It's just part of the culture for me to</br>   grow like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Let me go back and then if you could talk a little bit more about the</br>   experience in detention, that would be important for us to know about it.</br>   When you grew up, did you see a lot of your parents? Were they working all</br>   the time? What was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I guess I grew up more with my grandma because she would go and come back.</br>   During summer, I would stay with my grandma more. Yeah, I did see my father</br>   a lot. Mostly my father. My mom was the one that was more time at her job</br>   because she became a supervisor of a company, so she had to be there most</br>   of the time. My father was just a construction worker so after a certain</br>   time, he can't work anymore because of the light. I grew up with my father</br>   a lot. My sister and I, he would take us to the park, take us swimming. I</br>   don't feel like I missed them too much. I always felt that we were a</br>   family. No, I don't think I got that experience. I do know of other friends</br>   that their parents were at work all day and he was by himself at the house.</br>   I was like, &quot;Hey, just come over here. You can come play at my house.&quot; We</br>   had a trampoline and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you celebrated both American and Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Well, January 6 is the Dia de los Santos Reyes Magos, so of course I wanted</br>   my toys. Then fourth of July was more like everybody doing firecrackers and</br>   of course I wanted to do that, too. When it was Dia de los Muertos, we</br>   celebrated a little bit different because we put an altar and we celebrate</br>   all our people who have passed away. Then the day before was Halloween, so</br>   we could dress up as whatever we wanted. Obviously, Christmas is both, but</br>   we mixed it because in the Mexican culture the Christmas is not only giving</br>   gifts, it's also doing, I don't know how you call them, when you go out and</br>   you sing songs, Christian songs-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Carols.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Carol songs or things like that. Instead of eating turkey, we ate Pozole.</br>   It was a little bit of both, of course.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tamales.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Tamales, yes. My parents had Chicano friends, they were third generation</br>   American, whose parents had moved there and they are already adults. Then</br>   their children were American, but they spoke Spanish. We had all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Which is your favorite holiday?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   My favorite holiday? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think, well, maybe every</br>   child's favorite holiday is Christmas because of the presents. I didn't</br>   really care about the presents. I cared more about everybody being there.</br>   Sometimes the whole family didn't see each other until the end of the year.</br>   I think that was the time where I really got to see all of my cousins or I</br>   really got to see my uncles. But a favorite holiday? I don't know, April</br>   Fool's maybe? [laughing] I could do a lot of pranks on people. I'm not</br>   sure. I don't think I had a favorite holiday.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   One last question about this. There's a lot of people, and this was</br>   surprising too to us, talked about discrimination between Mexicans, illegal</br>   Mexicans, and Chicanos. Did you experience that?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe not, because I grew up as a Chicano. Maybe not that much. I do</br>   remember other people being discriminated because they were from Mexico but</br>   from provinces, so they got even more. They got called paisanos. They were</br>   darker skinned, so I did feel it, not me personally, but I did feel it for</br>   my peers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Because you were a city dude?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, well, the area where I lived wasn't a big city. It was like _______.</br>   It wasn't super big, but it wasn't small.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You said you weren't like people from the provinces, so you were considered</br>   Chicano?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. That's, I guess, because of the area where we lived. I don't know. I</br>   guess my parents always wanted us to live in the nicer area so I would hang</br>   out with people like that. Then, when I would go see my friends, they</br>   didn't have white neighbors they had Mexican neighbors or people from other</br>   countries. In the area where I lived, we were the only Mexicans in the</br>   area. I do remember my neighbors that were black, the person on the side,</br>   he was my middle school coach from PE classes. We grew up in a very nice</br>   area. We had a front yard, a back yard, we had a pool in the back, we had a</br>   trampoline, we had a swing. I guess that's why they were working all day so</br>   they could provide us with that type of lifestyle. I didn't really feel</br>   that personally, but I do remember other people discriminating. I don't</br>   want to say for lower class people, they did. They did get that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   When you got arrested, what happened? You got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got handcuffed.</br> </br> </br>   Anne:</br> </br> </br>   Were you driving at the time or were you-</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I was driving. I was coming back from work. I had the truck. I had my</br>   father's truck. He had all the tools in the back, and I was just coming</br>   back from work. There was a checkpoint. I got pulled over. I had a</br>   permission that they give teenagers to drive. I remember giving that. Then</br>   they were asking me more questions and then I started getting nervous for</br>   some reason. Then they started questioning me, &quot;Hey, why are you so</br>   nervous?&quot; &quot;You're here. I don't know what you're trying to do.&quot; Then they</br>   took me into the, I don't know how to call it, separos, where they separate</br>   you from– There’s a glass window and they just put you in a room. They make</br>   you take off your shoes. It's like a cell, like a big cell. I do remember</br>   looking at people and they're like, &quot;Wow, man, these people really look</br>   bad. I'm just 18 years old. I'm just a child.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They detained me there. I was there for six hours. I remember not being fed</br>   until a police guy, I guess he was Hispanic, he asked me, &quot;Have you eaten?&quot;</br>   I said, &quot;No, I haven't.&quot; He went and got me some McDonald's. I do remember</br>   it was a long time, though. Then, they took me in to the county. I was in</br>   Arkansas. I went into _____________. Then that's whenever I said, &quot;Okay, so</br>   it's real.&quot; They put me into the outfit, it was an orange outfit. I was</br>   separated with other people. It was hard because I didn't know, I didn't</br>   understand like that. I said, &quot;Well, I don't think I can compare myself to</br>   them. They really are people who either hurt people or they’ve done</br>   damages. I don't think I have done that.&quot; I was in there with those people,</br>   so I guess they put me in the same category as those people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then they put us in a big cellblock, and they would ask me, &quot;Why are you</br>   here?&quot; I'd say, &quot;Just being illegal.&quot; And then I would ask them, &quot;Why are</br>   you here?&quot; &quot;Oh, first degree murder, armed robbery, possession of</br>   paraphernalia, drug trafficking.&quot; I was like, &quot;Wow. Well, I'm just</br>   illegal.&quot; They were like, &quot;Oh, don't worry. You're going to get out. You're</br>   not as bad as we are.&quot; I was like, &quot;I hope not.&quot; It was whites, blacks,</br>   from other nations, Mexican, Hispanic people. It was everybody mixed. I do</br>   remember people just being with each other. White people being with them,</br>   and black people being with them. I said, &quot;Why? Why can't we all just be</br>   together? It was like that at school, why can't it be here?&quot; But I guess I</br>   started learning that racism exists, and you have to either defend yourself</br>   or defend your people.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember even defending a person from the Marshall Islands because a</br>   Mexican guy had taken his food. I said, &quot;Hey, man, don't take his food.</br>   That's all he got to eat.&quot; They were like, &quot;So, what, are you going to</br>   defend them now?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm just defending a person. He's just like</br>   us. We're all detained. We shouldn't be like that.&quot; But they got onto me</br>   and they said, &quot;Either you're with us or against us. If you're against us,</br>   we're more.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, I guess I can be with you guys,&quot; just for being</br>   scared. Then after that I was there for about a month. Then they took me to</br>   a real prison. I remember they asked us to do jobs like clean your cell,</br>   clean the bathrooms, and things like that. Again, I was only 18 years old.</br>   I didn't know why I was put in prison with those people. In there, yes, I</br>   met some people that really had done some really bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Was this a maximum security?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't know. I don't think it was maximum security, but it was a federal</br>   prison. I think it was called ____________ or something like that. I was</br>   there for a couple more months. It was the same thing in there. If you were</br>   Mexican, you had to be with Mexicans. There were people in there from</br>   Russia. There were people from all over the world. But it was a federal</br>   prison. I remember asking, &quot;Is this an immigration prison or is this a</br>   federal prison?&quot; &quot;No, it's both. We keep both immigrants and… you know&quot;</br>   Yeah, I did get scared a lot, especially with just being 18 years old and</br>   being with people who are either double my age or older. They really had</br>   gang tattoos all over their face. They had marks. They had a lot of things</br>   going on with them. I remember hearing stories that they did. I was like,</br>   &quot;Wow.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [43:33] They would ask me, &quot;So why are you in here for?&quot; I didn't want to</br>   lie because I didn't want to make them think that I was a bad person or</br>   like, &quot;Yeah, I'm hard, too.&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I'm just here because I'm</br>   illegal.&quot; Then I remember a group of Mexicans from Mexico City approaching</br>   me. It was like 18 people. They were like, &quot;So, why are you here?&quot; &quot;I'm</br>   just illegal.&quot; They put me in a room. I thought, I don't know, you hear a</br>   lot of stories that they're going to do to you. But they were actually –</br>   They had my back. It was like, &quot;You are our youngest guy here. Don't worry.</br>   We're going to take care of you. What do you need?&quot; They gave me food, they</br>   gave me clothing, they gave me sandals.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   These are inmates.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, inmates. They said, &quot;We're going to protect you but at the same time</br>   if you see something happening, you need to step up. It doesn't matter if</br>   your cellmate is white. If he goes out and harms another one of our guys,</br>   you have to step in. If not, we're going to step you out.&quot; Luckily nothing</br>   ever happened when I was in there. But it was drastically [unintelligible</br>   43:48]. It was a new experience for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You discovered racism in prison.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Real racism. In school you always hear people talking, but then the next</br>   day we're friends again. We have to be in the same class and do group</br>   activities. I guess now that I think about it, those kids, they were just</br>   acting what they would see on TV or what their parents taught them. But,</br>   yeah, once I got to prison, I guess I felt it more directly. During high</br>   school, it's just a normal shit talker saying, &quot;Hey, go back to Mexico, you</br>   don't belong here.&quot; You can always defend yourself there, saying, &quot;Hey,</br>   you're not even from here neither, so what are you talking about?&quot; Or &quot;I</br>   could be more American than you. Ask me any question and I'll answer it</br>   just as well as you can.&quot; I guess that was our power was being able to</br>   speak English and say, &quot;Hey, I can speak Spanish and you can't and I'm</br>   already learning French,&quot; because I took French classes. &quot;You don't even -&quot;</br>   Things like that. It was just more like bullies trying to be a bully.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Not really a racist. I do remember when I was working in construction, we</br>   went to a chicken house to do a couple of jobs there. One of the guys, not</br>   my co-workers but one of the guys that I guess it was his property, he did</br>   say something that I got offended at. But at the same time, I said, &quot;Well,</br>   it's kind of real.&quot; He said that he had left out some shoes or boots out on</br>   the field and the next day that he went to go get them, they weren't there.</br>   He said, &quot;One of those Mexicans probably stole them.&quot; It was probably true</br>   because there were some people that did those activities, but at the same</br>   time you're not sure. What if it was one of your own guys? Or what if you</br>   misplaced them? I did get back at him. I remember getting some scissors and</br>   I started cutting all his fence. I just started cutting the wires like,</br>   &quot;Okay. Now you can really talk about it. Yes.&quot; I guess that was my form of</br>   defending myself. I don't think it was the best thing.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember that day I was crying back home. I said, &quot;How can people just, I</br>   don't know, how can they discriminate if really if we take out our skin,</br>   we're the same on the inside? We both have flesh and bone. We're going to</br>   bleed the same.&quot; I'm like, &quot;It doesn't matter where you're from. We're the</br>   same on the inside.&quot; I guess that was one of the few things because I</br>   worked with American people my whole life. They gave me jobs, they fed me,</br>   they would invite me into their house. Some people had pools, said, &quot;Hey,</br>   we're going to have a pool party and I want you to come because you're one</br>   of my workers.&quot; Christmas parties where the company invites the whole</br>   co-workers to eat. I don't think I felt it until that day and until I</br>   arrived to prison.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did anything bad happen to you in prison?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No. Actually I was well taken care of by those people. They always told me</br>   that if I ever need anything, I should just call them or walk up to them</br>   and they would try to take care of me because I was the youngest. Most of</br>   the people were in their late 20s, 50s and I was the only teenager. They</br>   were like, &quot;No, you don't belong here. We're going to take care of you.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did your family visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They couldn't. They couldn't because they were illegal too, so they</br>   couldn't. They couldn't. I guess the only other way was to write letters. I</br>   never received any letter, but I do remember writing them. That was our</br>   freedom through writing letters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But you didn't receive any.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did they write you?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Probably not. No, probably not. I think my dad said he did, but I never</br>   received it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Did you see your family again before you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. I came back home. I came back home, and we fought my case, and my dad</br>   was actually locked up with me in county. He didn't go to prison like I</br>   did. He got out pretty quickly. I don't know why even. I'm not sure why. I</br>   don't know why I was the only person that was taken to prison. I don't</br>   know. Maybe they were just trying to prove a point. Then my dad came back</br>   to Mexico first. But I do remember meeting up with my family and then them</br>   telling us that we have to do something or we're going to keep getting</br>   those type of cases. Actually, my sister was sent to Mexico first. She</br>   didn't get any deportation. My mom sent her back to Mexico. She was only 15</br>   years old.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [49:44] Then my dad came back and then I was living with my mom. I guess</br>   that was one of the most difficult part of my life was being with my mom</br>   and watching her struggle because I couldn't really work because I didn't</br>   have the papers. She could because she also had an illegal name there. She</br>   wasn't working under her name. She had another person's papers. She was</br>   able to work, but instead of my dad helping her out, it was on her. Of</br>   course, she had car payments, rent, bills. That's when I saw and I said,</br>   &quot;Hey, I need to do something. If I stay here, all I am doing is causing my</br>   mom to spend more money.&quot; So, I told her, &quot;Hey, I think I'm going to go</br>   back.&quot; Then I came to Mexico. She still stayed there. She was probably</br>   there for 20 years. But she moved to a different city.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is she back now?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, she's back now. Yeah, she's been here for maybe five years, four</br>   years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   She stayed all by herself for another five years?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   For another– I had stayed for 13, she stayed there for another seven years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why didn't she come back?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   She was trying to make money so when she could come back, we would have</br>   something. She did do it because now she has a car. I guess that was it.</br>   But as my mom and dad got separated, they eventually divorced. It was hard</br>   on both of us, my sister and I. I did feel guilty because I thought that</br>   because of me being deported caused my mom to send my sister and it caused</br>   my parents to separate. I did feel bad about that. It was horrible because</br>   I felt like I was a bad person. I felt like it was my fault that my parents</br>   got divorced. I felt really bad.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [51:59] Then as I got older, maybe in my mid 20s or early on, when I was</br>   25, I learned that I had nothing to do with it. It was their choice.</br>   Recently, my mom came to visit here, and it was amazing because once again</br>   my whole family was sitting down at a table eating together. My mom has a</br>   boyfriend, my dad has a girlfriend, so I guess they put those issues aside</br>   as, &quot;Hey now, we're still family. It doesn't matter who's next to us. We're</br>   always going to be a family.&quot; This happened last month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It was like Christmas.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it was amazing. We all sat down at the same table to eat. I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, we can work this out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Tell us about coming back. You said it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   [53:02] Yeah. Maybe not coming back. I was really excited. I was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   yeah. I'm going to go back to Mexico and everything's going to go perfect</br>   because I'm Mexican.&quot; I came back and I tried to go to school. It was too</br>   expensive. I either had to work or study but I didn't have the money to</br>   study. I wanted to be a welder. I tried to do it here in Mexico, but they</br>   didn't pay at all. They didn't pay well at all. My uncle told me to become</br>   a teacher. I didn't want to, obviously. Who wants to be a teacher of other</br>   children? I saw the potential. All my cousins say, &quot;Hey, you teach me</br>   English because they're asking me at my job to have a percentage.&quot; Friends</br>   telling me, &quot;Hey, teach me English,&quot; or including meeting girls. They were</br>   like, &quot;Hey, you speak English? You should come teach me.&quot; &quot;Oh, yeah. Why</br>   not?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   It was good for that part but at the same time I did feel discrimination by</br>   my own people because they were saying, &quot;Hey, you're American. What are you</br>   doing here?&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I'm Mexican. I was born here,&quot; because my Spanish</br>   wasn't good. Even still today it's not the best. They're like, &quot;You need to</br>   learn how to speak Spanish.&quot; I said, &quot;I do speak Spanish, just not as</br>   well.&quot; It's like, &quot;You need to learn how to speak English.&quot; My defense has</br>   always been like that, &quot;Yeah, okay, you too.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Should’ve spoken to them in French.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Yeah, and I didn't use it then, but I should have. But I did feel a</br>   cultural shock especially because, in Mexico City there's all kinds of</br>   people, all kinds of people. Of course, when I was in United States, I</br>   would hang out with people that listened to hip hop. That was it. I didn't</br>   really meet people that listened to metal music or reggae or things like</br>   that. I started going out with my cousin, he's a guitar player, so he</br>   started inviting me to his events. I would see different kinds of people.</br>   People with long hair, makeup on, all black. I thought it was pretty cool,</br>   like, &quot;Okay, they have their own identity.&quot; Then I would go into the reggae</br>   events and saw people with dreadlocks, different type of black style,</br>   including people that worship other– Not just Christianity but people that</br>   practice Buddhism or practice Satanism or things like that. I said, &quot;Wow.</br>   It's amazing.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to</br>   hip hop, like, &quot;Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.&quot;</br>   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that</br>   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,</br>   they say, &quot;No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; Those</br>   were the words. I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yes. The way you</br>   have tattoos, the way you dress. We're not looking for people like you.&quot; I</br>   said, &quot;What does that have to do with my knowledge? I'm probably smarter</br>   than that guy right there. What does that have to do with my knowledge?&quot;</br>   &quot;No.&quot; Because I had piercings also. Then it's, &quot;Because our image is not</br>   like that.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Every job I try to go get, it was like, &quot;No.&quot; I was shut down. I learned</br>   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started</br>   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go</br>   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's</br>   like, &quot;Wow. So, it was just all about image.&quot; If you look nice, they're</br>   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or</br>   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my</br>   advantage and said, &quot;Okay. I need to do something.&quot; That's when I said,</br>   &quot;Okay, maybe teaching is a good opportunity since everybody's asking.&quot; I</br>   started looking for schools.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Then there was this one school that they said, &quot;Hey, I don't care how you</br>   look, just you do need to change some things, but I'm not asking you to</br>   completely change yourself. Just so that you can seem legit.&quot; I'm like,</br>   &quot;Okay. I can do that, I guess.&quot; I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,</br>   &quot;Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?&quot; I said, &quot;Why not? Maybe</br>   it could be better.&quot; So, I did change for that school, but then I realized</br>   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to</br>   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, &quot;No. I can't do that no more.</br>   I can't.&quot; Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's</br>   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.</br>   So, I said, &quot;No. I have to quit. I have to quit. I am getting paid well, I</br>   have everything I have because of that, but I can't lose my identity.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I got out, and then I realized that I didn't have to be different. I could</br>   still be me, but I could act some way around certain people. Yeah, it was</br>   hard because I didn't want to, I didn't want to but I felt like I have to</br>   because if I didn't I wouldn't get what I wanted, or obtain what I would</br>   get. But I do feel bad for becoming, not a total prick, but I do remember</br>   saying, &quot;I don't know, don't buy from him because he's from the street,&quot; or</br>   &quot;Don't buy your groceries there because it's not a good store.&quot; Things like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Is that becoming a prick or was that becoming more Mexican chi-chi?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Oh, okay. I kind of guess that. Like, &quot;Oh, I don't want to take the Metro</br>   because I'd rather take a taxi.&quot; Things like that. Because I was making</br>   more money and I could afford a taxi. I said, &quot;No, that's not me. My</br>   parents never taught me to be like that.&quot; That's why I left that school. It</br>   was a very big school, but they did practice Christianity. They kind of,</br>   not forced us, but they said, &quot;Hey, if you want to be part of this, you</br>   have to follow this, you have to come to our meetings, you have to come to</br>   our events.&quot; I guess that's what made me turn a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It didn't appeal to you, the Christianity?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't mind it, but if they're trying to force it on me, then I say– It</br>   could have been like other religions. I just feel like if they try to force</br>   something on me, I'll say, &quot;No. I'm sorry, but you can't do that.&quot; Because</br>   my parents, they're Catholic and my mom eventually became Christian because</br>   of her cousins in the United States. I had a lot of ideas. Once I arrived</br>   to Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, I don't want to be part of no religion. I do</br>   believe in God, but I don't want to be part of no religion.&quot; I guess that</br>   made me see things differently because there are lot of beggars in the</br>   street, and that school taught me to look at them differently. I didn't</br>   like that. Or when we had events, we all had to dress nice and everything.</br>   When we walk in the street to go to that event, we would see beggars in the</br>   street. My co-workers, they would look at them with, &quot;Ugh.&quot; I guess I</br>   started to do it the same just to be part of it. I realized, &quot;No. I'm</br>   wrong. I'm wrong for doing that. That person is just like me. He's also a</br>   human.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Speaking to my cousin helped me out a lot because he had other beliefs. He</br>   was more into the historic part of things rather than to look at it how it</br>   is. If he would talk about religion, he'd say, &quot;It's just a part of</br>   history. We're all the same. It doesn't matter if you follow this or that.</br>   We're still human.&quot; He made me realize that it doesn't matter what religion</br>   you are, you're still a human. When we're born, they say, &quot;Hey, he's born a</br>   human.&quot; They don't say, &quot;Hey, he's born a Christian,&quot; or &quot;He's born</br>   something.&quot; I guess he made me open my eyes towards that. That's when I</br>   realized that I have to leave that school so I wouldn't become something</br>   that I'm not. Now I don't discriminate no religion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Listening to you, it makes me think of the fact that you had this choice to</br>   leave. In prison, you didn't have a choice. To survive, you had to be with</br>   the Mexicans, you had to play that. But once you were here, you could</br>   exercise your free choice, right? Your free will.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. I could.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You described the prison where you had to be with the Mexicans because it</br>   was a question of life and death.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   But here, you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I didn't have to. I didn't have to. Right. Yeah, I guess that part has been</br>   struggling for me. I always think that there's a right and a wrong, but</br>   that's on both ends. What about the middle part? I don't want to be right</br>   nor wrong. I want to investigate first. I don't want people to tell me,</br>   &quot;Hey, you have to do this because it's the right thing.&quot; I would say, &quot;Hey,</br>   but you're not telling me what the bad thing is so how do I know what your</br>   right is also my right?&quot; I guess that becoming neutral to things because</br>   too much of one thing can also be bad. Not enough of another thing can also</br>   be bad. You have to always keep it in the middle, keep it neutral. There's</br>   no right or wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   How did you feel the Mexican government treats returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   They don't care. They have no – They don't care. I guess now that we've</br>   become more, they're starting to look into it. But back then, they didn't</br>   care. Even if you're Mexican living here, they didn't care so why would</br>   they care about another person that hasn't been here? I don't think they</br>   care.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   If you were given a chance to talk to them and to say, &quot;You should care,&quot;</br>   do you think they should care?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't think they should care.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't think I would want to sit and talk to them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Why do you think they should care? What's the argument? Why do they have it</br>   wrong?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Because we're a big community. If they want our vote, they need to start to</br>   care. A lot of us, it's going to be either the first or second time that we</br>   vote. They have to start caring and start to look into our community</br>   because we're also Mexican, but we're not Mexican from here, we're Mexican</br>   from another place. They should care because if they want our vote, they</br>   should also start looking into that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Do you think you bring special skills that they're missing?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. Yes. English. Mexico is – I hear they want to make Mexico in the next</br>   20 years to become bilingual. They can't do that without us. They can't.</br>   They can try, but it's like learning Spanish in the United States. You'll</br>   learn it, but you're not going to learn Spanish like we do in Mexico. We</br>   have that. We have both Spanish from here and both English from there. They</br>   should start to look into that. I don't know how to answer that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   It's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah, it's a hard question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about your education?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   That, too. I feel like a lot of us that have come back, we don't have that</br>   opportunity to continue our education because we don't have the money. We</br>   don't have – Including just to get your ID here, you go through a lot. You</br>   have to take a lot of documents that you don't even know if you have. A lot</br>   of people that came back, they don't even know what Mexico is like. Even</br>   trying to get an education, what are we going to study? What career can we</br>   make, or can we select to become part of a helpful community? My best guess</br>   is languages, not only English but other languages like French or German. I</br>   think if we want to be a first world country, we have to act like it.</br>   That's where our government is not putting its full potential because we do</br>   have the resources, but they're so corrupted that they'd rather keep that</br>   to themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What about values?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Values?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. Do you think that growing up in the U.S. you come back with certain</br>   values?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Now that you mentioned it, yes, we do bring a lot of values, especially in</br>   the cleanliness. In Mexico City, everybody's accustomed to whenever they</br>   finish their package of whatever food they have, they just throw it on the</br>   floor. Not everybody, of course, but most of the people do that. Us,</br>   growing up in the States, we know that that's a horrible thing. Like, &quot;You</br>   shouldn't do that. What type of person are you?&quot; You know? That's one</br>   thing. Cleanliness. We bring that. Being independent. Over there in the</br>   United States, when you're 18 like most of the people that turn 18, they</br>   get to live in their own apartment, have their own car. Here in Mexico, of</br>   course we can't afford it. Sometimes we're 25 and we still live with our</br>   parents and we still have to give them some type of expense. Maybe that.</br>   Being independent.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I remember my cousins telling me when I was only 18, and I was trying to</br>   have my own apartment already. They're like, &quot;Why? Why? You should just</br>   live with your dad.&quot; I'd go, &quot;No. I want to have my own room. I want to</br>   have my own kitchen.&quot; They're like, &quot;No, don't worry about that. You can</br>   just ...&quot; I don't know. I guess we're more attached in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that you come back with certain values that are</br>   different?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Some of us. Not all of them. Not all of us. But I think if we gather</br>   together and separate our difference, then yeah. I think it's possible. It</br>   maybe is going to take a long time because even here in Mexico we tend…</br>   Let's just say in Mexico, él que no transa, no avanza.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   No transa, no avanza?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. Do you know what that means?</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yes. If you don't transact, you don't make it.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   You don't negotiate.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Exactly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Make, connect, whatever, pay off.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Maybe if we stop thinking like that, because like I said, if you enter a</br>   system that they're going to pull you in. Maybe if we stop thinking like</br>   that and say, &quot;Hey, I'm not doing this for me, I'm doing this for all of</br>   us,&quot; the next person can say the same thing. He can influence another</br>   person to think the same thing because I think that here in Mexico, it's</br>   all about what I can do for myself, not really for others. Maybe if we</br>   change just a little bit on how we think, then maybe we could. Maybe we're</br>   the ones that need to plant the seeds so that the next generations could do</br>   it. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Do you feel Mexican or American or both?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I've always been asked that question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   I know.</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I always say, &quot;I can be more Mexican because I love history and I love</br>   studying about my culture here as a Mexican. I know more than the average</br>   person does about Mexico.&quot; Then they question me about, &quot;How is it like to</br>   be an American?&quot; I have that answer also. But now-</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   What's that answer?</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   Now I don't want to be a nationality. I want to be a human. If aliens from</br>   different planet come, they're going to be, &quot;Oh, wait, not the Mexicans</br>   because they're cool. Not the Americans.&quot; No, they're going to say, &quot;Hey,</br>   all of you are humans and we're going to take over.&quot; I hope it never</br>   happens, but I don't think I want to be Mexican. I don't think I want to be</br>   American. I just want to be human. I think because if we are placed in that</br>   category of just a nationality, then it reduces everything because people</br>   categorize. Even in movies, they say, &quot;Best Mexican actor,&quot; or something</br>   like that. Like, &quot;No. He's an actor or an actress. He or she shouldn't be</br>   categorized as best Mexican or best Hispanic. They're humans. They have the</br>   talent just like anybody else.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sylent:</br> </br> </br>   I don't want to say that I'm Mexican or American. I am both. I'm</br>   bi-cultural. I just don't like that. I don't like what they say. I'd rather</br>   we say, &quot;Hey, we're human. You and I are human.&quot; Yes, later on we get that,</br>   later on they tell us, &quot;Okay, you were born in Mexico so that makes you</br>   Mexican.&quot; But since we're born, we're born as human, not even as a woman or</br>   a man. We're born as a human. Yeah. I get asked that question a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita:</br> </br> </br>   Yeah. It's an amazing answer. A human.</br> </div><\p>
