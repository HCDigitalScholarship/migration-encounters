That's what we're here for.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: You told me in the survey that you crossed to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> when you were</br>   three years old—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: So you don't really remember that much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: No, no.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: In that case, what would you say is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of your earliest memories</br>   of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> of my earliest memories of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> I remember as a young person</br>   was walking into a supermarket called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Albertsons</span>. I don't even think it</br>   exists anymore. I remember walking into that supermarket and all the smells</br>   and everything that you would see was just unreal from everything I had</br>   experienced earlier in life—I had never seen anything like that. I will</br>   always remember that, going into the store and seeing everything all</br>   stacked up nice and neat and the smells that were there.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What's one thing from the store that you remember specifically?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I don't remember much really about the store, but I remember that when</br>   we would get there I would get out of the car and I would look at the sign</br>   that would say “E3” or whatever parking space it was, because I wouldn't</br>   want me and my mom to forget where we parked.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: So that's normal stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You were with your parents?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, yes. I was with my parents. Obviously, most of that time I was</br>   alone due to the fact that most people go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> chasing a</br>   dream, as they call it. It's money, really, that people need to get by.</br>   They have certain standards and they're willing to make a sacrifice.</br>   Unfortunately, most of the time that sacrifice, when there's children</br>   involved, leaves that person alone because they're chasing their dream that</br>   they have. They want better for them and their children, not only for them.</br>   But yes, I went with my parents.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You said that you still had siblings in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, but I'll put it this way, they're not my direct brothers and</br>   sisters, they're from my mother, with another father. So I never even</br>   really knew them—I didn't even know them that well. I consider them family</br>   because genetically they're family, but I never lived with them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: How did you learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> when you were in the states?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Just watching cartoons I guess. I remember I used to watch a program</br>   called “<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Bewitched</span>” a lot. I used to think it was funny how one of the</br>   characters on there would talk and I would always try to imitate him. And</br>   somewhere along the line I started putting words with the actual objects</br>   and so on like that until I could actually start conversing. I think that's</br>   how it happened.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: That's cool. So you went to school in the states, do you remember</br>   any teachers or friends or any people that had an impact in your early</br>   childhood?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Oh yes. Most definitely. Mrs. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Hera</span>, she was my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> grade teacher. She</br>   was of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span> descent, and she was real cool. She was the person who</br>   showed me that you have to be proud about your heritage. Also, another</br>   person that was very important in my school was Mrs. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mercado</span>. She was real</br>   important because when I started going to school in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> they</br>   didn't have a program called ESL, which is now known as <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> as a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span></br>   language—that just simply didn't exist. When that program came out, Mrs.</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mercado</span> was the one that actually took that program into my school. She's</br>   the actual <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> person who ever showed me what something actually was in</br>   English and in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, where I actually knew for a fact that's what it</br>   was, because my parents couldn't help me with that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Another teacher of mine that got me to start taking advanced math</br>   classes, he kind of thought that I had talent for it, was Mr. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mulligan</span>. He</br>   was right, I ended up doing pretty good. So those <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span>. Also, when I was</br>   in high school I think Mr. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Doltree</span>, he was an ex-professional football</br>   player, he was a coach there, and he had a big impact on me. Those high</br>   school years were rough and he kept me kind of in line right there. That</br>   was good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Why do you say that the high school years were rough?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Well it's a combination of different factors. As just a regular teen,</br>   just to go through that is kind of awkward. You're in a rough spot.</br>   Being—how could I put it this way—of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> descent in an area where it's</br>   not predominately <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> is also very difficult. The fact that you don't</br>   have anybody to express your situations to—because there's always my father</br>   and my mother, but they would never understand the situation I would</br>   encounter in high school because it's a whole different culture, they never</br>   experienced that—it's a very lonely time. And also hormones going around,</br>   and wanting to experience let's go to here, let's go there. Mr. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Doltree</span> was</br>   very important in that, trying to keep me settled down and keep me in</br>   sports. He's very good at that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Were you ever exposed to any sort of gangs or any sort of violence</br>   like that around your neighborhood?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Most definitely. Most definitely. Once we moved out of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> home</br>   we were staying in where it was predominantly all white—even though it's</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">the San Gabriel Valley</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Arcadia</span> is predominantly white. After we moved out</br>   of there, we went over to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Monterrey Park</span>, it was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> community. This</br>   situation as a kid, I encountered gangs. My parents weren't home, and I</br>   would go to the park after school and the local rec department, play the</br>   little board games, but that's over at like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">five or six</span>. My folks don't get</br>   home until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">eleven</span>, I don't have anything to do, so I stayed at the park and</br>   I started hanging out, getting to know the local gang members. That's how I</br>   first encountered that situation.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Did you ever get involved in any of them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Can you tell me a little about how that was like and what you did?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I wouldn't like to recount on the things I did because they're not</br>   something that I'm really proud of. But [Pause] I can say that I wish I had</br>   another chance. That's pretty much it. Recounting everything is kind of</br>   like a pointless situation, it's just a lot of suffering worded in</br>   different ways. I'm sure I'm not the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> guy who probably told you that.</br>   The fact of the situation is simple—and I think it's better to be put this</br>   way—there's a lot of suffering going on, and it's not just me. It's a</br>   question of not only who you are or where you live or if you speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span></br>   or you don't, most people that go from here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, they go</br>   to work and when they've got small children those children are alone at</br>   home. There isn't much for us out there, especially when we don't even know</br>   the language, so the only people that will stick their hand out to us or</br>   say &quot;Hey, you're okay,&quot; are these guys.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: You guys might call them scum, but they're the guys that lifted my</br>   hand. They're the guys that told me you're okay, they're the guys who told</br>   me we don't care if you speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> or not. So, they kind of became my</br>   family, I had no other choice, you know? So that's how I encountered them.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, you have kids.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Who are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizens.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes. Yes, I do, very much. [Araya 00:10:27] <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Elizabeth</span>, she's</br>   twenty-six. I've got <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Julia Angelica</span> and <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Julian Angel</span>, they’re brother and</br>   sister, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> different mothers. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Julian</span> is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nineteen</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Julia</span> is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seventeen</span>, and</br>   that's it. They're over there, I keep in touch with them, they're doing</br>   very well. This is to express what's going on, you know inside, so I'm not</br>   going to beat around the bush. You could tell that these kids have got real</br>   bad daddy issues. So even now that I'm not even there, I see how everything</br>   that has happened is not only affecting me, but even generations after me</br>   are being affected by this whole situation. They know that I'm good, they</br>   know that I'm not a gang banger anymore, they know that I work, they know</br>   that I'm good. They know that I'm a regular person, but they still don't</br>   have me. They're old now, they're probably not going to need me, but there</br>   are some issues that they're going to deal with the rest of their lives,</br>   and that's not a good thing for anybody. I wouldn't wish that on anybody.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How would that be different if you had stayed in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I think the simple fact of knowing that you've got a father figure in</br>   your life makes a big difference. I know this for a fact, and the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span></br>   knows this for a fact. The government knows this for a fact, and the prison</br>   industry knows this for a fact, because we all know. I've been to prison, I</br>   know it's a business. And I know who runs all the PIA industry, the prison</br>   industry authority, I know who's running all the USBs as well. It’s all</br>   government people behind all them names and they're working for themselves,</br>   so they get these tickets and they have people working for them for</br>   basically nothing. It's slave labor. And they're also getting paid for</br>   having you be a slave at the same time. It's business all the way around.</br>   And they know that if a father figure is not home, having them in prison</br>   for some stuff that maybe they could find an option for. I'm not saying</br>   that people do bad things they deserve good things, no. But I'm saying that</br>   there might be options.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: You can't just keep sticking people in prison all the time, you can't</br>   keep throwing them away. The problem is still there, you can't hide it</br>   anymore. It's happening. People are going out, and people are shooting</br>   people. The laws are getting stricter and people out there, they think if</br>   I'm going to go to prison for the rest of my life I might as well hold</br>   court right here in this place. And the government knows that if a father</br>   figure is not home their kids are more than likely going to end up being a</br>   low paid slave laborer in prison as well. Those are numbers, and that's</br>   something that can't be denied, you know? I was stupid and I fell into that</br>   number game. I regret that, but somebody needs to hear that, they need to</br>   know what's really going on.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: It's not about somebody did a crime, it's about how they’re setting us</br>   up. How could I stick my foot out then you fall and say you fell on your</br>   own? No, you didn't do that. You didn't do that brother. Or let me help you</br>   up. Nobody's saying that anymore, nobody reaches out their hand to help you</br>   up. And the way things are nowadays with media and everything that's</br>   accessible, people are just getting more desensitized <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">everyday</span>. Everyday</br>   people care less and less. It's a very grim future.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: As far as the migrants here, we're having a real bad time. It's not</br>   easy. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">Sixty-five pesos</span> an hour sounds like a lot to somebody who lives</br>   here, but I want to take my family out for a vacation and I'm never going</br>   to be able to do that with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">sixty-five pesos</span> an hour. Never, ever going to</br>   be able to do that. I'll save <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten years</span> and won't have enough money. These</br>   are things that are going on. People get deported, nobody cares about them.</br>   You're trash on the street. They don't even care enough to give you a piece</br>   of paper that's valid in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. So you get out, you're nobody. Just</br>   because you get out dressed because you just got out of prison and they</br>   just did you over, you're clean, you just took a shower, but they just give</br>   you a dirty blanket and put dirt on your face, you're any guy on the</br>   street. You know what I mean? That's what's going on. So we've got to start</br>   from nothing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: So all these things go on in the deportees minds—it's the different</br>   culture, it's the “Who am I here? Where do I go to get my paperwork? I miss</br>   my family.” It's emotional, psychological, economical, you name it. There's</br>   nothing you don't go through when you go through this process. But it's</br>   livable. I've lived it. It can be done. But nobody deserves that. Honestly.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Tell me about prison, tell me about how you got back to</br>   Mexico—what happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I got busted for—I think it was possession of a controlled substance.</br>   It had been a series of things, it was escalating, but it wasn't like I</br>   tried to kill somebody or murdered anybody. It was just like I was just a</br>   kid who loved to get high and be in the street.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How old were you at that time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about twenty-five</span>. So then anyways, I went to prison and after</br>   that I went to the feds, did the fed time. And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a month</span> before I was</br>   to get out … Oh another thing, when you're a person that's going to get</br>   deported or they've got you written down like that—somebody should at least</br>   hear this—you can't even get a job in federal prison if you're not a legal</br>   citizen. But you're forced to live there. So, if you've got a case number</br>   where you're going to be deported, you can't work and get paid like every</br>   other individual does. Or at least at the time that I was there, and I was</br>   at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">Jessup State Prison</span> now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: So even before you even get out you've got to find what to do—you find</br>   yourself tattooing somebody, scarring them up for the rest of their life</br>   because you want to put some in your locker, you want to eat something. So,</br>   there you go. Pick up <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">another six months</span>, thank you very much sir. “Can I</br>   have a job?” ”No you can't.” Then you get out and, as I mentioned they</br>   don't give you any valid job in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, and even if you get a little check,</br>   it's going to be a big old thing for you to even cash it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. You get</br>   robbed for like I don't know, say <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">20%</span> of whatever you've got. So, if you've</br>   got $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">20</span> and that's going to be like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">400 pesos</span> for you, and they're taking</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">50</span>, that's going to hurt you. So that's another thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: You got deported after you were in prison for how much time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Four and a half years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Four and a half years</span> [Emphasis]? Wow, I thought it was only three</br>   months. So you were in immigration—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: In immigration for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three months</span>.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: For <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three months</span>, and then you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four and a half years</span> in jail.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes ma'am, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: And you couldn't work and get paid.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: No. You cannot. In federal prison you cannot, at least in the time</br>   while I was there, ma'am, you cannot.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Sorry for reacting like that, I just thought it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three months</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: No, no, no, it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three months</span> at terminal island. They went to go see</br>   me, they pick me up, then they took me over to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">South Carolina</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">South   Carolina</span>, they flew us to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oklahoma</span> out to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">Marsh Air Force Base</span> in</br>   California, and from there to Long Beach.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Did you try to fight your immigration case, or you couldn't?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I wasn't provided all the information necessary to be able to make an</br>   adequate evaluation of whether it was worth it or not. They just said</br>   &quot;You're gone, no matter what, you're going to be gone, you want to fight</br>   it? You're going to be here a couple of years and then you're still gone.&quot;</br>   Okay, so do I want to stay in prison <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a couple of years</span> in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, or do I</br>   just want to get out after doing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> and some change? I think I want to</br>   get out. But then I got on and I found out that due to the fact—that as I</br>   mentioned—I had already been under the amnesty law I could have applied for</br>   some benefits, I think that's what they call it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Do you know a little bit more about the amnesty law that you can</br>   tell me?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I just remember that ... I was real young, and I never really cared</br>   about that to be honest with you. I know it's kind of dumb. But I grew up</br>   like if I was a kid from over there. I had all these struggles going on,</br>   but basically, I never thought about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, ever coming back, it never</br>   even crossed my mind. That's not something that I thought of. I thought I</br>   would be living with mom and dad. Basically all I remember is that all you</br>   have to do is prove that you have been going to a public school for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five   years</span> or more and if you were underage, automatically your paperwork would</br>   start. And I was provided with a social security number and everything. So</br>   I even had a social security number.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And you still got deported.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, so I would imagine, I see a lot of people that didn't have</br>   anything at all, and they were having action for the same things I was</br>   getting deported for, and I was wondering why. But they knew what they were</br>   doing. The court system and the law system in general, it's a psychological</br>   game. And they know how to play it real well. They know where to put</br>   pressure. So, they knew what to do with me when I was at that point where</br>   like sign here, get out, or stay here. They know what they're doing. And</br>   the public pretender, because they're not defenders, that they gave us,</br>   they didn't provide much help. They basically reiterated what the previous</br>   person had said to us. They weren't no help.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: [Pause] so, you've been here now <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about seventeen years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Almost, yes <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seventeen years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: How was the return?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Rough. Really, really rough. As I mentioned, you've got no paperwork</br>   right here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, you've got no paperwork, you're a nobody. It's not</br>   like they run your prints like in the states and they know who you are,</br>   it's not like that. So basically, you're nobody. You have to start with the</br>   most menial jobs. Obviously hazardous probably to your health or</br>   whatever—very bad pay, and you're subject obviously to living … How could I</br>   put it this way? You live at the expense of what you're making, which means</br>   if you have a menial job, you have a menial life. Simple as that. So very</br>   much a lot of things missing from my home. Wasn't able to take a shower, a</br>   hot shower, for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">years</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>—I think until I was more or</br>   less on my feet, because it does take a while.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I started off working <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">night</span> clubs, obviously exposed to the same kind</br>   of situation that I had been in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. Found out I didn't want</br>   to be about that, I said you know what I'm going to try this out. So I</br>   started trying to look for other jobs and then after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about the third year</span> I</br>   stopped actually concentrating on not being in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> and</br>   actually started thinking about living here. I said I'm going to take some</br>   courses. I took computing courses and some data management courses, and I</br>   started looking for better jobs until I came here. I came back here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I started off in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Tijuana</span>, and then I came here because over there,</br>   there's still a lot of the same situation going on, a lot of people being</br>   deported, a lot of things going on over there, I didn't want to keep seeing</br>   and it brought a lot of pain to me. To see a lot of good people in bad</br>   situations. I don't know if you've ever been down there, have you ever been</br>   down there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Not to Tijuana, no.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Well one time if you ever do get a look or get a chance to go, you'll</br>   see a lot of people, could be you, could be me, could be anybody you're</br>   looking at and they're sitting in gutters, in the wash, because they don't</br>   know where to turn to. They didn't have the resources or maybe they didn't</br>   have the mentality, or maybe they weren't prepared, or maybe they were</br>   depressed, to start looking for a solution for what they're living in.</br>   There's people down there that have been living there a lot of years and</br>   they just can't get out of the fact that they've been deported. That's a</br>   very sad situation. So, I decided to come over here and found this job at</br>   this call center and I've been here ever since. We're doing good, we're</br>   supervising now, we're doing good.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: That's good. Growing up did you know you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I wasn't really undocumented. So, I told you, since I could remember,</br>   they started that amnesty thing for me.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Because of the amnesty thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Right. So, I remember going to junior high I remember maybe, maybe in</br>   high school, maybe <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">ninth</span> grade— I went to my last hearing, I remember. I</br>   don't remember where the building was, I don't know if it was CCV, criminal</br>   courts really, downtown <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span>. I don't remember where it was, but we went over</br>   there, had a hearing. Supposedly I was supposed to come back, and then all</br>   the prison stuff started and I just never went back. I guess eventually it</br>   caught up like this guy isn't showing up, it's over, but I don't remember</br>   when that was. I never really noticed when that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: That's interesting. Okay. Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: No problem at all.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: All right, so now going back to coming to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, you mentioned in</br>   the survey bureaucratic difficulties as one of the challenges, can you</br>   speak a little bit more on that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, most definitely. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span> of all, you know you're coming from the</br>   States, you look like you're from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, and you're in any border</br>   town, you're going to get gaffled up by the police. Especially if you're</br>   hanging out, because obviously you've got no home, you ain't got all the</br>   money in the world to be hoteling it, so eventually you're going to be</br>   hanging out somewhere—I could talk about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Monterrey</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Tijuana</span> because I've</br>   been to both of them. If you don't have an ID, they could just pick you up</br>   and take you to jail for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">thirty-six hours</span> without you having anything or</br>   having done anything. I think it's some law called conflictive zone or</br>   something like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: But any border town has that law. How am I going to have an ID if I</br>   don't have any paperwork, I don't even know where to get one? I don't have</br>   a residence so now I'm just going to be hiding from the police running</br>   every time they come. So that's just to begin with. Once you get started</br>   and try to do whatever you've got to do, it costs <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">a pretty penny</span> to try and</br>   get your stuff together. Luckily, I had my mom in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, she</br>   was able to send me my birth certificate. With that I got started or else I</br>   would have had to pay <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">a couple thousand pesos</span> just to get that. And where</br>   would I get the money from once again if I'm not working, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: So, we're back again to very, very, very few options. We're kind of in</br>   the continuation of the systematic thing that's going on in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. I’m</br>   sure somebody that's planning to deport somebody thinks about what may or</br>   may not happen during that process. So, I'm sure that a person sitting in</br>   the States figures that in order to be a justified <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen you must have</br>   some sort of documentation verifying who you are. So it should be like that</br>   in any country. Right? But they know they're not providing us with that. So</br>   basically they're setting us up to be in the same crime. Who's going to</br>   hire me? Who's going to provide me with an opportunity to get all my stuff</br>   together? Where is the funds going to come from to be able to get</br>   established? You know what I'm saying?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Aside from that I've got to already run from the cops every time that I</br>   see them because I don't have an ID. You're already institutionalized, you</br>   come from a place where the mentality is already wicked, right? So, it's an</br>   ongoing thing, it's a snowball thing, it's not just a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> thing, it's a</br>   continuation of the same thing. I didn't jump from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> stage to another,</br>   I'm living the continuation of my deportation. This moment is a</br>   continuation of my deportation and if it would ever help me to get back</br>   [Chuckles], that would be great, but this is just something else that</br>   continues off of the same scenario, people getting deported. Living</br>   environments, predispositions. That's pretty much it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Before I ask you something else, I want to ask you if you could</br>   tell me one thing that's been the hardest for you since your return, other</br>   than all of the ones that you've already said.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: The hardest thing is the emotional separation. The emotional separation</br>   and the shock of… it's my culture, because I belong nowhere, you know?</br>   That's the hardest part, knowing that I'm from nowhere. Like I'm not really</br>   from here. I'm not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, but I'm not from here either, you know? So I</br>   think that's the hardest part.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: A lot of migrants—we've been doing this for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">over a year</span> and a lot</br>   of them tell us I'm neither here nor from there, is that how you feel?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes. Yes. Well I feel like I'm from there, I'm just rejected. It's kind</br>   of like the black sheep of the family. The whole family is rejecting you.</br>   But I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, everything I do is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, the way I think is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>,</br>   my speaking is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, my thoughts are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. I don't process words in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. You speak to me in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, I've got to translate from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> to</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> to speak to you. You know? So yes, I'm just kind of a non-wanted</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> child then. That's the way I feel pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: That's a very good way to put it. I think it really comprises a</br>   lot of what we've been hearing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes. Because it's true. You know, my whole mentality—I could tell you</br>   program shows from probably even before you were born such as the “<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Howdy   Doody</span>” show. And stuff like, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> words that would ever come out of my</br>   mouth in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and at that age if I'm barely learning to speak anyway, so</br>   you know, we're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. My solution is that's why I'm so successful in my</br>   job, because when <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> customers call in and they have issues and they</br>   need to talk to somebody who understands their way of thinking then they</br>   put me on the phone, because I understand the way they look at things. See,</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> people are real practical, right? It works or it don't work. If it</br>   don't work, why don't it work, I need it to work, and if I'm entitled to</br>   something, make it work. That's the way they think, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people</br>   don't think like that. A lot of people, they're bilingual, they go and take</br>   calls, but they don't understand the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> thinking aspect of things. So</br>   they're unable to communicate.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I'm curious as to how you've been able to go from being a part of</br>   a gang to being a part of that lifestyle in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> to doing what you're</br>   doing now in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and leaving that behind, and kind of the thought</br>   process behind that decision.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Basically, I was stuck at a point where I'm in a place where I don't</br>   want to be and I'm always thinking of a place where I'm not going to be at,</br>   so I've got to start doing something to get to where I want to be. I</br>   figured I got to start laying down a track record. So eventually, when I do</br>   attempt to try to do something about this situation, I have something to</br>   back me up. Like hey man look at me, this is me, this is the guy you're</br>   dealing with. It's been this much time. This is where you left me and look</br>   at where I'm at. I want to see my family, I want to hold my kids.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And I'm to understand that you have family here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, that</br>   you have a wife—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, I have a wife and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> little girls here, yes I do. Very beautiful.</br>   Her name's <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lupe</span>. I've got a little girl, she's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eleven</span>, her name's <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Layla</span>,</br>   and the youngest one her name's <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rosita</span>, she's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six</span>. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Layla</span> is getting out of</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">sixth</span> grade so she's going over to junior high, or “secundario” as they</br>   call it here. She's really excited for her graduation, which is coming up</br>   in almost like a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">month</span>. So, we're ready for that, went and got the dress</br>   and everything, it's really nice. Yes, I mean, living a normal life. But</br>   I've got to be honest with you, I still miss that part of me. I still miss</br>   the fact I wish I would be able to get at least a job at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">McDonald's</span>. I know</br>   I'd be able to take care of them a lot better than I can with this job</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You can't get a job at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">McDonald's</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, but they don't pay the same [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Ah, okay I see what you mean.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Right?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I see what you mean, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I mean a person that works at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">McDonald's</span> … I work in an office</br>   building. People think that it's nice, I don't know why. It's just another</br>   place. But yes, you're inside, you don't see anything.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Well you see the fancy security guards out front and you're like</br>   “Oh shit.” [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes right. I mean, basically, it's not a good good job. You can't</br>   really live really good like a normal job. Like I said, I'll never be able</br>   to take a vacation with my family. That sucks. I work hard, I'm an honest</br>   guy. Whatever has happened in the past, it's over with now. And I think as</br>   a working person—I've been working for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the past almost six years</span> here,</br>   almost—I deserve that, and I'm never going to be able to get it. Yes</br>   there's a lot of things I still miss about over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: I want to know a little bit more about how you've taken what</br>   you've learned in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> and what <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> made you as</br>   and applied it to your life here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, if that makes any sense at all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, of course. As I mentioned, I feel <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. So obviously I have</br>   very, very rooted patriotic type things in me, about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>,</br>   even though I haven't been treated correctly I feel, it makes no</br>   difference. I know I was maybe not the best guy, but anyway. Of course, I</br>   grew up watching TV, I've seen all the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Budweiser</span> commercials and all the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> flags flying and halftime at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="EVENT">the Super Bowl</span> and all of that</br>   [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span> laughs]. So, of course I feel that, of course.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: My thinking is I want to be number <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span>. My thinking is I want to keep</br>   reaching for my goals. My thinking is I can do this. That's what I was</br>   taught. My thinking is all the things that I told you my teachers taught</br>   me. The kindness of Mrs. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mercado</span> for instance, the way she showed me</br>   English—correct English, not just spoken off of the TV. That care, I use</br>   that everyday in my life, that has stuck with me. The thing that you can do</br>   this. Don't be typified by what somebody says you are. Because I was</br>   already a little gangster when I was in school. But Mr. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mulligan</span> said “Hey,</br>   you're not just that. You've got a brain, you can use that.” And he showed</br>   me that I could be much more than what people think that I can be, or what</br>   society thinks that I should be. So I'm still all of that. I've got all of</br>   that. Of course, I do.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Do you still root for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> teams?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Well I'm going to be honest with you, okay? Not in soccer [Both laugh].</br>   But all the other sports obviously yes. My favorite team, and I hate to</br>   admit it, has been the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Rams</span> ever since <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Jerome Bennis</span> was with them back in</br>   the early 90s. I remember <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the LA Lakers</span>—also my favorite team back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the   day</span> when <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Abdul Kareem Jabbar</span> and <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Magic Johnson</span> were still in the team—way</br>   back before Magic had AIDS. Obviously, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Dodgers</span>, I love going to the</br>   stadium. When I couldn't get into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">Dodgers Stadium</span>, I remember going in</br>   front right over the five freeway, right at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">Griffith Park</span>, and I'd watch</br>   the game straight from the park, just across the freeway you could look</br>   right into the field. I mean all of that, of course, I love all of that. I</br>   love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">fourth of July</span>, I love going to Long Beach on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">fourth of July</span> and</br>   watching the pier fireworks, all of that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: What about hotdogs and hamburgers? And that sort of stereotypical</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> thing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yeah everybody loves that. Since there's so many things to choose from</br>   over there, I was just into specifically little things from certain places.</br>   I remember going to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Shakey's Pizza</span> and getting the mojo potatoes, those are</br>   so good. Or going to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">The Hat</span> and getting a pastrami or going to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Tommy's</span></br>   Burgers and getting myself some chili cheese fries. All of that of course</br>   is good, really good. I hope to have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of those again one day. Or at</br>   least I would like to have a restaurant over here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Yes. And yes, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> music, all that—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Of course.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Any favorite bands?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I'm really into oldies, so I'm into the old groups. Like <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Brenton Wood</span>,</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Tina Marie</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Al Green</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Teddy Pendergrass</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Al B.</span> Sure. A lot of them, I like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Cool. So those were fun questions, let's go back to the other ones</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Let's go ahead.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: If you could have stayed in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> what do you think</br>   you would have done?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I would have eventually been the right hand of my father. He's an old</br>   man now, and he's having a hard time. He has a really nice business and he</br>   needs somebody. And I would have been there probably. That's where I would</br>   have been. I would have been a regular man like I am now, working with my</br>   father, and taking care of him. Which is another reason why I want to be</br>   over there. They're old, they're going to need somebody to take care of</br>   them eventually—they're already established, they've got their home there,</br>   their whole life is established there. My mom's pensioned off. She's real</br>   sick, she needs to be near her doctors, so she goes to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Kaiser</span> and she needs</br>   somebody to take care of her. So I would be there with her. That's where I</br>   would be.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Did you say that your parents became citizens?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes, both of them are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizens.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: What is your dad’s business?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: He's a general contractor.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Now that you're back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I know you've been here for a</br>   couple years, but still what would you like to do, what are your goals,</br>   what are your dreams at this point?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Well obviously I would like to have a little business right here. I've</br>   been thinking about a couple of different things. I think in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span></br>   you've got to be practical, this isn't like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. So, I think</br>   here people need to get places and people need to eat. So, it's either</br>   going to be transportation or some type of food ordeal. I would like to do</br>   that, I see myself doing that. Maybe within <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the next two to three years</span></br>   because you've got to make an educated investment. There's a procedure for</br>   that, you've got to have a certain amount of money to cover you for at</br>   least <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the first six months</span> and so on and so forth. So, I want to make sure</br>   I'm set correctly, I want to make sure I give it the best option possible.</br>   I'm thinking <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span> I'll be doing that, and I'm also planning to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next   year</span> start some courses right here at my job, university courses. Hopefully</br>   I get back to computer-oriented design and do that for a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: For my last set of questions, I'm going to ask you some that are a</br>   little bit more reflective, not necessarily about your experience, but then</br>   we can go back to that. So what do you think that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government</br>   can do to help returning migrants reintegrate into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> society?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span> of all, give them paperwork to begin with. That's the least you</br>   could do. That's not even a necessity, that's just a right. You had to be</br>   somebody. I wouldn't put that as a suggestion, I would put that as a</br>   definite must. Then as a suggestion, maybe try to open up some centers—not</br>   the migrant centers where migrants come from other parts of the country and</br>   even further down south and they take care of them, no, the reverse. More</br>   centers where they help people like us to get started. I know there's a</br>   couple of them. I know the guy here, I've heard about him, he's doing a</br>   good thing. Hopefully it pans out, I wish I could help.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You can.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Yes. You can volunteer.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: That would be great. I would love to do that. More services like that.</br>   Because as I mentioned, there's a lot of terribly bright people, good</br>   people with skills, with intelligence, fully able, and they're just rotting</br>   away. Feeling like they're nothing. They're human too, you know? I was</br>   lucky I escaped from all of that, because I had family. Because I had a</br>   base. A lot of people don't have that, and they deserve it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I think as humans we need to look out for each other.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What can the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span> government do to help <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> deportees</br>   and the families that they leave behind in the states?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Oh my goodness.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I know it's a big question.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: [Scoffs, Pause] You know what would be crazy? Maybe it's asking too</br>   much and it's an outrageous dream, but I have thought about this before.</br>   Why don't you stop messing with us, and you know there's a border, and</br>   there's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and there's the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, right? So there should be like a place</br>   where people could live that you could actually still be with your family.</br>   Like a tolerated area, kind of like either in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> or the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, because</br>   breaking up families sucks. My kids, I'm telling you, my kids have daddy</br>   issues real bad. Probably my son will end up in prison one day. And that</br>   really sucks.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I mean it sounds crazy, they've got red districts all over the world, I</br>   would think that they would call this a family red district I think, I</br>   don't know what that would be, but—</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: A buffer zone or something.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes something of that sort because it's obvious that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span></br>   at this point at least is nowhere near making a positive decision for</br>   neither the families or the deportees. Right? So they're not ready for it.</br>   And even if they start talking about it <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">today</span>, it will still be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">years   before anything happens</span>, and families are still rotting away. People are</br>   still suffering. Kids are still asking for daddy. There's somebody right</br>   now at this moment right now, I guarantee you ma'am, crying because their</br>   mom or their dad or both of them aren't there anymore. Because there are</br>   cases like that. So, I guarantee you right now there's somebody shedding a</br>   tear. There's somebody, and it's not just the people left in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>, it's the people trying to get back, they're like “What do I do? I</br>   risk it? If I try to go back, they might not even allow me to even attempt</br>   to go back legally. What do I do? What are my resources?”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: They need information. Right? I think that would be … I think having an</br>   area like that even though it sounds ridiculously crazy, would probably be</br>   the one solution that would be possible. That way the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> could still have</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> could still have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, and we that are neither here nor</br>   there could have our families. Right? Everybody gets what they want.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: That doesn't sound crazy to me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Well you know. Land rights are a thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Especially if we're in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Latin America</span> [Both laugh].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: But that would be awesome. That would be just great.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: At least a momentary solution.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: So why do you think that young <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> men in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span></br>   turn to crimes and gangs? I know you touched on it a little bit, but—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Because there's no real <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> leaders. We've got people going out</br>   there on TV talking all this, but I don't see nobody going back to the</br>   neighborhood. I don't see righteous guys standing up, saying “You know what</br>   I lived this experience, I'm going to become a counselor.” You do see a</br>   couple of guys that are outstanding stories, we're talking about Mr.</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Escalante</span>, I got a chance to meet the man. Really, really great. Mr.</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mulligan</span> introduced me to him. These are great people, they're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span></br>   people. They're great leaders. They took a lot of people out of the</br>   streets. But we need more of them. Since we don't have them standing up on</br>   their own, we need to develop a program to make them stand up, to show them</br>   how to stand up, to make leaders. Not for a leader to be born on their own</br>   because that's a difficult situation—we've got everything to lose. We</br>   should develop a program where we actually like start proactively</br>   installing a network of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> leaders that will help us out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Like here is our processing center, we're going to send you to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span>,</br>   we're sending you to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span>, we've got the same doctrine, we're going to help</br>   these people, and we're going to get them off the streets. We're going to</br>   show them that being a young <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> is something to</br>   be proud of. It's not something to be ashamed of. You're not to be</br>   typified. That's the things that we need, because one guy can't do it</br>   alone. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> guy can't do it. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cesar Chavez</span> can't do it, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Escalante</span> couldn't do</br>   it, and all the people from back on the sleepy lagoon days, the people that</br>   got shot at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Horseshoe Bar</span> from [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">Unclear 00:50:23]</span> and all that. These</br>   are things that have happened in our culture, a lot of times. Sometimes I</br>   wish we were black, these people they've come from a bad situation and have</br>   learned that they've got rights. And us as <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanics</span> we still haven't</br>   learned that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: We haven't learned to value ourselves. We haven't learned to accept,</br>   let people in general know the value that we have to them as a country and</br>   as individually. We add to the culture of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. We work the</br>   jobs that nobody wants to work, all the jobs that are paid too little for</br>   people to even want to work them. That's the things that we need. Those are</br>   the programs that we need to send money into. Privately if need be. I would</br>   give whatever I make here, I would give money if they would say “Hey we're</br>   starting a center where we're going to develop <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> leaders to get</br>   people out of gangs and off the streets and off drugs.” I would give to</br>   that. I've lived through it, I know what it's like and I know it's</br>   eventually not going to end up right so I would want to avoid that for</br>   another human being, right? I think that's what we need.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: This is a similar question, but on the other hand, what can the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government do to prevent migrants who return from turning to crime</br>   and gangs and organized crime I guess, all of that, upon their return to</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: There's nothing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> can do at this time for us. At all. Because they</br>   need to get over their corruption <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. A sick man cannot help a sick man,</br>   right? So, it's never going to happen. These guys are never going to care</br>   about us. Imagine this, so <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government gets some funds to help out</br>   their local community. Let's say a park. So, they're going to clean up a</br>   park and they're going to put new swings or whatever. They're going to</br>   steal <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">half</span> of that money, and this is for the people who are actually</br>   normal people. Now take a guy with no documentation, all tatted up, that</br>   doesn't even know the language correctly, that has to run from the cops</br>   every time that he sees them, do you think that these guys are going to</br>   care about them when they're provided funds for them to do something for</br>   them? Oh no, it's not going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: So the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> thing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> needs to do is heal before they can start</br>   trying to help heal others. We're never going to get any help. The only</br>   people that can help us is other people, maybe like myself. Maybe if one</br>   day I have something I'll be able to go over there and maybe start a little</br>   home where people could come and get their stuff straight and go on about</br>   their business, right? But <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> can't help us. They're not ready.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yes, it's interesting because I feel like that same line of</br>   thinking you could also apply to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> in so many ways, and so</br>   many other places.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Right. It is happening, but the fact that there's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> in the</br>   United States and there's laws in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, and there's righteous</br>   voting in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, or at least for the time being, right [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span></br>   laughs]? We don't know what these funny things going on what may or may not</br>   happen, right? But—</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: We've got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> to find out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: But in the meantime, I think we've got a better shot over there than we</br>   do over here. Yeah, we need that, of course we need that. But we've got a</br>   better shot of getting help from over there, at least from the private</br>   sector. Let's not talk about the government because, I mean—[Pause] it</br>   sounds real harsh and it probably sounds something that's going to sound</br>   negative towards the purpose, but you can't feed somebody in their mouth,</br>   you've got to work for it, right? So there's got to be some people that</br>   stand up and say “You know what, man, we're going to start this on our own</br>   and then we're going to look for help from the government, but let's do</br>   this.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Not this “We're not going to do nothing until the government starts</br>   helping us.” And I think that people could actually could request for</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or any deportees to be provided some kind of legal paperwork that</br>   validates who you are before they let them go. I think that could be worked</br>   out. I think that the person verification process in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> is</br>   good enough for any other country in the world to say “Yes they know who</br>   they're talking about, and allow them to provide us at least with a</br>   temporary ID just to start with.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: This is my last question, it may be more like a double question,</br>   but it goes along with the whole idea of paperwork. Why doesn't the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   government validate the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> paperwork, and why do you think that</br>   people in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> have such a negative perception of returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: First of all, most people right away think and they're not entirely</br>   wrong, “Bad people man. They're getting deported, they're coming from</br>   prison.” So I think justifiably the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people have somewhat the right</br>   to be afraid of us. I'm going to explain to you why. Because just like</br>   we're fed stuff that is said about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> people, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people</br>   are also fed stuff about what the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span> are like, and that's not a pretty picture. I can say that very, very</br>   strongly because I have some really, really nice friendships with people</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> that have costed me a long time to be able to come about to</br>   be, because of the apprehensions that they had over the fact that I was a</br>   deportee. So it's difficult, it's a difficult question.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: That people don't look at us the right way—with a lot of reason—but</br>   it's like we're being projected in a certain way. I think the only way that</br>   we could get rid of that is by doing programs that allow people to see us</br>   in a different way. Whatever it would be. Have people out there working to</br>   ... how can I say it, to kind of lobby us into regular jobs. So people</br>   could see like, “Hey there's this guy all tatted up working in an office</br>   building. He was pretty cool, he's an intelligent guy. He's not that bad.</br>   He's not a drug addict. I mean he looks like he's not that type of person,</br>   you know.” Where they could might give us a chance, and that I think will</br>   chain ball into people thinking it different.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: There's always a difference as far as the tattoos are concerned,</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people before, if they've seen somebody with a tattoo, I mean it</br>   was practically call the cops on them, now everybody has them. It's a</br>   culture thing now. So, I think they're going to come around. But as far as</br>   with the deportees in particular, we need to be projected into regular,</br>   everyday tasks, so people can kind of look and learn type deal, you know?</br>   That's how I think it could be solved.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Well those were all the questions that I had, I know it's a lot</br>   and a lot to talk about, so thank you again. And now what I want to do is I</br>   want to give you the chance to say whatever you want to say right now,</br>   either something that you feel like you didn't tell me, or something that</br>   you want me to know, or anything else that you'd like to add or clarify or</br>   whatever. This is kind of just a free for all reflection moment or whatever</br>   for now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: I would just like to say that we as people living in this situation, we</br>   need to unite and try to do something about it. I think people in general</br>   should take a step back and look at the whole situation, and look at what's</br>   going on and look at what it's causing, and maybe at that point they will</br>   see that the steps that they're taking at this time, they're not fixing</br>   anything, and they're not going to fix anything, and these people have had</br>   this information for many, many years. Since like the sixties or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the   seventies</span>. They know that if a parent is not at home, their child is, I</br>   don't remember the exact percentage, but it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">over eighty something percent</span></br>   that that person is also going to be in prison. So it's either <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span></br>   things, we that are going through this wake up and see that we're a victim,</br>   or the people that are doing it—and aren't doing it in a bad way—take a</br>   step back and look at what's really going on and figure out another way to</br>   do things.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Just figure out another way. You don't have to let us back, but just</br>   figure out another way to let us do things. You don't have to fix my life,</br>   but stop wrecking more lives. You don't have to fix my son's life, but</br>   don't take another person's son’s life away from them too. What's happened</br>   to me has already happened, I'm trying to deal with it. Hopefully one day</br>   I'll get to go back, but you should stop doing it to other people. It's not</br>   a good thing, and it's not going to stop. It hasn't stopped or diminished,</br>   it's actually increased in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the past seventeen years</span> that I've been here. So</br>   as far as that it's going to get better and all this stuff that's being put</br>   out by the parties or whatever, government will be, that this is actually</br>   going to fix it— I'm living proof because I've been here for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seventeen   years</span>, and I've seen how this situation has only gotten worse, and the way</br>   that it's going it doesn't look like it’s going to get any better.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: So just be sensible. Think. Step back. Look. Regroup. Take</br>   responsibilities and act now, because later on there's going to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">hundreds   of</span> thousands of people and no matter if they put a wall or whatever they</br>   might put, if they put <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">the Great Wall of China</span> there it's not going to stop</br>   anything. I mean, it's a known fact, these are just little things that are</br>   going on to try to deter the people from actually looking at the human</br>   factor and the suffering that's going on and the fact that what they're</br>   doing is not doing anything to help. That's pretty much it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Are you satisfied with everything that you've told me? Are you</br>   good?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">JC</span>: Yes. Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: No, thank you.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
