   Anita: I don't want to make you relive horrible experiences or talking<br>
   about it. So it's up to you what you want to share or not. But if you were<br>
   willing to share a little bit the reasons for you leaving for the United<br>
   States with me here?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: I will be happy to do it. It's not an easy subject, but I believe<br>
   that if I could share my story, maybe other girls wouldn't feel lonely.<br>
   Because I felt lonely once and I know that I'm not on my own. And I feel<br>
   safe in this place talking about it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: Thank you.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Of course. Well, I was five when my mom left me and the only<br>
   people that took me in was my grandparents. My grandma really likes Mexico<br>
   so I spent half of my life, my childhood here. I remember [inaudible] but I<br>
   live across from... It's not a security center, but it's jail. So here we<br>
   call them reclusorios. And I remember the guy, my mom, my grandma's friend,<br>
   I'm sorry I call her mom. My grandma's friend came and he had no money and<br>
   actually no extra stuff. So my grandma, in order to help him, told him that<br>
   he could rent a room inside my house. So, I instantly hated him. I didn't<br>
   like him. But since I didn't have a dad, he began buying me toys and candy.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: And he kept saying that I was like a child, like his daughter,<br>
   because he never had any daughters. So I began opening up to him and<br>
   thinking that he was my dad, because I never had a dad. So at the moment, I<br>
   didn't know what was going on. And my grandma didn't leave me for quite<br>
   long time, but the moment she wasn't there, he would abuse me. And of<br>
   course, I didn't know what was going on until one day. Because he was very<br>
   erratical. He -- one day he was happy and the other he was just out of his<br>
   mind.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: One day I was playing with my dolls and I remember him calling<br>
   people and locking the whole actual home, mobile home doors, windows,<br>
   everything. And he kept talking to people. And I heard that, I overheard<br>
   actually, that he was going to take care of me, that I was his, and that<br>
   they could do whatever they wanted with my grandma. Of course, I was really<br>
   little, I was like four or five. And I obviously knew that there was<br>
   something wrong. I saw my grandma crying. I saw him hitting her and nothing<br>
   was happening to me. I wanted to help my grandma, but he never… he would<br>
   push me away and tell me that everything was okay and that I was going to<br>
   go to a safe place. Of course I didn't believe him because I saw how he hit<br>
   my grandma.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: So, my house is divided in a funny way. So, we have our own house,<br>
   two floor house and on the back we have little apartments where people<br>
   could live, right? So, we have a a kitchen window and the kitchen window,<br>
   if you would jump, you could go to the apartments. So I had a friend that<br>
   lived over there, a little girl. So I remembered and I told him, could I go<br>
   drink some water? At first, he was really hesitant. He didn't quite want to<br>
   let me go drink some water alone. But I told him that I was fine and I<br>
   loved him. I tried to fool him at five years old. So I jumped out of the<br>
   window. I called one of my neighbors and he saw me and he had my grandma's<br>
   hair. He was pulling her hair and telling me that if I was going to do<br>
   something stupid, he will kill her there.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: So I started crying and my neighbor, he was a guy, he told them<br>
   that he didn't have to do that, he was going to give him money. And my<br>
   grandma had money because of my grandpa, so they gave him money in order<br>
   for him to walk away. He walked away. But the next day he came with his<br>
   car, and we have our garage. So he backed up the car and got into the<br>
   house. We remember hiding in the apartment upstairs because he was looking<br>
   desperately for us. We called the police, he left but my grandma knew that<br>
   he came for us, to take us because the first time I believe that money<br>
   wasn't enough and maybe he wanted me or both of us. So the next day he<br>
   called my grandpa and stated that it wasn't a safe place to be anymore.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: So about a week later, we gather our things, and since we couldn't<br>
   do the paperwork. Because my grandpa always wanted for us to have the<br>
   residency is to live in the United States, but we never actually thought<br>
   about it, but I don't know, my grandma we really didn't think about it. But<br>
   she grabbed her stuff, and then next week we were in the United States<br>
   because of that reason. I never told anybody that until I got into to the<br>
   States and I took sex ed. I remember when they first started talking about<br>
   it because my grandma is very religious. So, no riding bikes or watching TV<br>
   or having any mobile phones. So I didn't know really what sex was. So I was<br>
   13 when I found out that I was raped when I was little. And I remember<br>
   thinking, me thinking about how other girls get raped and thinking that<br>
   must be so hard.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: And when I knew that a person who I thought loved me was raping me<br>
   at such a young age, something happened in me and it just clicked. So I<br>
   started behaving bad and I didn't know how to respond because I was getting<br>
   bullied at my school. So this is a random thing but so my best friend in<br>
   middle school was pregnant. They thought it was me or she blamed it on me.<br>
   We used to send letters, like those little letters in classroom. So they<br>
   caught us one, like many, but one of them, my math teacher read it. And he<br>
   sent us to the office. And I didn't want to say that my friend was the one<br>
   that was pregnant. So I never said anything. I was like, I'm not going to<br>
   say anything. I didn't want to snitch on her per se.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: She blamed it all on me. My grandpa came, he was furious. And they<br>
   did tests and I told them that there was no way of him testing that I was a<br>
   virgin because I was raped. He didn't know what to say. Nobody knew what to<br>
   say. I never told anybody this. He was the first one that heard it. And he<br>
   never said anything.Maybe because he was embarrassed of it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: This Is your grandpa?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yes. He has never talked to me about this stuff. He's very<br>
   closed-minded, I say?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   And he never talked about it. So I got suspension. So when I came back, all<br>
   kids<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   thought I went away for like about a week because I aborted. So they<br>
   started<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   rumors and they started throwing food at me, it was horrible. It wasn't<br>
   their fault.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Now I know that because it was just rumors, but they used to beat me up in<br>
   the<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   restrooms. They used to throw food at me, sing songs to a point that I<br>
   didn't go to<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   the cafeteria. I used to eat in the restroom.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: So all of that was going on while me knowing that I was raped and<br>
   my mom<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   never wanting me around and not able to speak to anybody because my<br>
   family's<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   so closed-minded about it. So I decided to tell my grandma... I understand<br>
   her<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   now. But at first, when she told me, I hated her for such a long time. She<br>
   told me<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   that it was my own fault. She told me to not hang out with him and I didn't<br>
   obey. I did whatever I wanted. And she told me many times not to do it. So<br>
   at that point I thought, but I was a minor. I was five. How could I have<br>
   the responsibility toknow who to hang out with and who not to hang out<br>
   with? It made me feel so guilty to a point that I thought I was guilty. It<br>
   was a horrible experience, I remember it. But then my mom used to visit me<br>
   once a year. She has a visa and everything, but she used to visit me once a<br>
   year. I never knew why she did it, but she told me that she thought it was<br>
   best for me.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: So let me go over a few things. So this might be what you just said,<br>
   why did your mom leave you?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: I just talked to her recently because I never knew why. I don't<br>
   hate her, I love my<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   mom. But she told me that when she got pregnant, she was in college. She's<br>
   a<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   lawyer. So she was in college and then she got married when I was around a<br>
   year<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   old. So this was not my father. So the guy didn't want my mom to move me in<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   because he left to Baja California. So he didn't want me to go there. So my<br>
   mom<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   knew that my grandma was going to take me. She never knew about the<br>
   incident. My grandparents for some reason did not tell my mom. So my mom<br>
   thought that I was leaving to get a better school and economical life. She<br>
   thought it was the best for me. So that's why she let me be or leave. So<br>
   she used to come around, she saw how I was so sad. So here's the thing why<br>
   me and my grandma got separated. My mom took me in because she thought that<br>
   I was depressed. I tried to kill myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: How old were you then?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: I'm 22.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: No. When your mom took you in?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: I was around 16. I tried to kill myself the first time when I was<br>
   13. And then I<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   tried to kill myself when I was 14. It was with pills the second time was<br>
   in a<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   moving vehicle. I didn't get any harm done, just bruises and stuff. But I<br>
   was on<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   the freeway and when they realized that I was going to do that, they slowed<br>
   down<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   the car and my grandma grabbed me. So I couldn't get out of the car.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: What do you mean? You tried to throw yourself in front of a moving<br>
   vehicle?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: No, I was inside the moving vehicle and we were in the freeway. So<br>
   I wanted to<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   throw myself out. You could say that my grandma saved my life because she<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   grabbed me. I hit the floor immediately, but my head never did. So it was<br>
   just my<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   arm and she grabbed me and nothing happened, but they never took me to a<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   psychologist or anything like that. I don't know why. I hoped, I… now that<br>
   I think about it, I wish they would have, but nobody did.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Because she was the only person who I think I could open up with,<br>
   maybe<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   because she didn't know me. I could open up to her. I'm in my head she was<br>
   my<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   friend. She was this fun person. And she let me do a lot of things. She was<br>
   the<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   first person who taught me how to ride a bicycle, which I was stressing I<br>
   didn't know how to ride a bike. But she was the only person who kind of got<br>
   me because I had no friends. So she told me that if it was okay, she could<br>
   take me, she had a job now she had money and she could take care of me. So<br>
   I said yes, because my grandpa was about to do the paperwork for us to get<br>
   our... It was our citizenship now because he's now a US citizen. So she<br>
   told me it was about five months that I was going to be with her and then I<br>
   was going to move back. But she thought it will help me for me to live with<br>
   her a little while.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: So I said, yes. I came back five months to Mexico, five months<br>
   passed, and my<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   grandma came. I saw her. And then we directly went to the courts. They<br>
   never did<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   the legal paperwork for the adoption. Here in Mexico whenever a parent<br>
   decides<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   to walk away, they just take you in and put in the last names in the birth<br>
   certificate<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   as if they were my biological parents. It's a thing that they do in Mexico.<br>
   I was<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   unaware about it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, they put your grandparents' names as your biological parents?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yes. Because that's something that a lot of people do here<br>
   actually, because they<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   don't go through the legal work. They just... “oh, she's not here, I'll<br>
   take care of her.” So, that's what they did. So my grandpa he's old and so<br>
   is my grandma. So they didn't know much about it. So they hired a lawyer.<br>
   The lawyer said it was okay. So we went to the embassy and my grandma<br>
   when... They did an interview and she was asked if I was her biological<br>
   kid, she said, yes, because she doesn't speak that much English. So she<br>
   said, yes. So immediately it was about a two, maybe four hour process and<br>
   it turned into a whole day.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Basically they accused my grandma of child trafficking. So we had<br>
   to fight it and prove that it was, I don't want to say ignorance, but my<br>
   parents were ignorant about the whole process, I mean, they tried their<br>
   best and they weren't aware of that they had to do a whole legal paperwork<br>
   for the adoption papers. Now then the time passed as she was on probation<br>
   for about a year. Then they told her that she could never go to the United<br>
   States anymore. My grandpa didn't do anything else. I thought that the same<br>
   thing, like the same punishment was for me too. So I never tried, I never<br>
   did anything. We waited a long time, so I was 18 and nothing happened. So<br>
   now I'm older, I'm an adult now. So I don't think I could follow up with<br>
   that.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: And I've always wanted to finish college, even if it was like<br>
   community college, I just always wanted to do something for myself. Because<br>
   here is very, very hard. My mom has struggled for many, many years. She's a<br>
   lawyer now, but she had to do a lot of things in order to get that way.<br>
   Well, to the point that she is now, she works for the government, but she<br>
   doesn't get paid very well. And we actually make fun of her because my<br>
   grandpa, well, actually my grandpa he's a gardener.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: He's a gardener?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yeah, he is a gardener. He wins the exact same amount in a week<br>
   than my mom does in a month. So we make fun of him cutting grass and stuff.<br>
   And my mom, she has a master's degree (laughs), and she earns the exact<br>
   same thing. So I know it's funny but it's the truth. Here in Mexico, you<br>
   could become a lawyer. I don't know, a doctor and you might not earn as<br>
   much money. So I've always wanted to have a home. When I came back here,<br>
   unfortunately here, it's very, very unsafe. I ride the subway every day.<br>
   I've had people jerk off next to me or masturbate next to me.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: When I got raped again, it was by a taxi driver. I actually got<br>
   pregnant. And because I was in such a depressive state, I tried to commit<br>
   suicide again. And instead of it killing me with antidepressants, I killed<br>
   my baby. So I had a miscarriage. It was horrible. I remember not telling<br>
   anybody, not my mom, nobody knew. Just going to the hospital and just<br>
   bleeding in the floor and nobody did anything. I went into surgery and then<br>
   that was it. I finally told my mom and we went to, well, the police. But<br>
   they stated that since I had no plate numbers, nothing, it was like looking<br>
   for a ghost. That's exactly what they told me. It's like looking for a<br>
   ghost. We're not going to find him. So they did nothing about it. And that<br>
   was it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: Can we go back to the States for a second?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Of course.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: School wasn't fun?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: It was amazing. My teachers were great. I've had plenty of<br>
   teachers, actually one that changed my life and way of thinking was Mr.<br>
   Martinez. He was a history teacher and he was the one who, whenever I<br>
   didn't have a place to eat, like the cafeteria, he will just say that I<br>
   could stay in and eat with other teachers. And I actually became real<br>
   friends with my teachers. They taught me a lot and he made me love history<br>
   and I had many English teachers and I love writing. I used to go to a<br>
   magnet school, which is for smart kids kind. So I used to be a great<br>
   student actually. So I won an award, the State recognized the award for<br>
   writing a short story. But to me, I'm really proud of it. Because me being<br>
   an immigrant and coming from Mexico and learning a new language within a<br>
   year, because I learned it too quickly because I hated that people made fun<br>
   of me because I didn't know how to speak it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: So I remember that before I got into school, I used to go to like<br>
   books and study and watch TV. I actually learned a lot of my English from<br>
   Two and a Half Men, which is a sitcom, it's one of my favorites. So I used<br>
   to learn things from that. And at first I taught myself and then I went to<br>
   school and obviously that reinforced it a lot much more, but I loved it. I<br>
   know I got bullied and I know it wasn't really fun place because of the<br>
   bullying. But regarding the teachers, the school, it was amazing.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: What was your short story? Do you remember the short story for which<br>
   you won an award? What was it about?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Oh, yes. It was about, I've always wanted to be a dancer when I<br>
   was little. So it was about a girl. It was about me. About a girl who used<br>
   to be a dancer and then her leg got amputated. It's kind of like a<br>
   reference of how I was studying ballet here and then I've moved to the<br>
   States and I just got so depressive that a part of me wasn't there anymore.<br>
   So even though I loved it, I stopped doing it. And I've always wanted to<br>
   become a prima ballerina, but I never got the chance to, so that won an<br>
   award. Yes, it was kind of like a reference. I didn't want to say it<br>
   literally, but it was kind of like a reference of me and that won an award.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: So it was as if part of you got cut off from what stayed in Mexico,<br>
   is that what<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   you're saying?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yeah. Exactly.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: Can you say that as a whole sentence?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Like if a part of me was amputated and left in Mexico. Not fully<br>
   me was a hundred percent in the States and it's like living a partial life.<br>
   50 in the States, 50 here, so you're not an American because you will never<br>
   be, you're not a true Mexican because you will never be. So it's kind of<br>
   like, what are you? It's weird. But I’ve learned to embrace it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: You need to write more, you know.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yes. I am actually writing a book right now. It's nothing<br>
   professional by any means, but I'm writing a book. And actually, the friend<br>
   that came along with me, he's the one who has always encouraged me because<br>
   I was so depressed. But he has always helped me. And my mom too. She's<br>
   always been there for me. I know that she left me and she wasn't there when<br>
   I needed her, but I love my mom. I truly, truly love my mom. She talks to<br>
   me like if she was my friend, my mom too. But she has always told me that<br>
   it doesn't matter who you are as a person, if you been educated, gone to<br>
   college, if you're anything in life, you could always write a book. That<br>
   stuck to me my entire life.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: What's your book about?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: It's actually not about me at all, but it's kind of like a science<br>
   fiction, because I'm a little geek.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: You like science fiction?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yes. Quite a lot. It's kind of like Lord of the Rings. It's about<br>
   mythology and all that stuff. Kind of like Game of Thrones.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: I'm on season five.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Oh, it's a lot, but I'm on season four. But I don't want to finish<br>
   it quite because I'm also a fan of Lord of the Rings. So I kind of want to<br>
   write a book about that type.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: So you got bullied at school, why?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Because people thought I had an abortion because of rumors of my<br>
   best friend. I understand why she did it. It wasn't fair, but I never stood<br>
   up for myself. And at some point I just let people believe it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: But didn't they know she was pregnant?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: No.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: But what happened to her? She had an abortion?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Oh, she walked away and then she had her kid later on. But I think<br>
   she dropped out of school. So nobody actually knew. So it kept and people<br>
   used to call me a slut and offensive words. And they used to throw money at<br>
   me. Guys would do horrible things to me. I remember that the chairs were<br>
   aligned and a guy used to put his knee on my butt and just kept touching<br>
   me. And I couldn't say anything because he used to say that I liked it.<br>
   That I was a slut anyway. So I never told anybody that until I got to AC, I<br>
   believe is... What was it called? ACP. when they put like-<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: AP?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yeah, like bad kids. I don't what is it called it, ACPA? I believe<br>
   we call it ACP. It's within the school. It's not like juvie or anything or<br>
   boot camp. It's within the school when you have a troubled kids or<br>
   teenagers, they put you in a separate room. So you don't get to talk and<br>
   you get to go to the cafeteria in a certain time when none of the other<br>
   students are there.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: So I believe it was called ACP or something like that. I don't<br>
   quite remember, but I was there because they thought I was a bad kid. And I<br>
   was because I didn't want to do my work because I was depressed and they<br>
   kept... “Why aren't you doing your work and used to be such a good student,<br>
   why you're not doing this?” And I used to reply back because I was so mad,<br>
   but not mad at my teachers. I was mad at myself, so I became a bad kid. Not<br>
   really, but I became a bad kid. So I had to go to therapy, which was a good<br>
   thing twice a week. And I used to study by my own in a quiet classroom. And<br>
   we just had assignments. No one-on-one teacher, there was a guard, but it<br>
   was through assignments by our own personal teachers. But it was a bad<br>
   thing, yes. But it encouraged me not to be bad because a lot of people that<br>
   I've seen that migrate to the States, not all of them, because I have a<br>
   person in my family who is a Dreamer. He's the first one in his high<br>
   school. Not in his class, in the actual high school.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: I know that not all of them become that way, but some kids,<br>
   including everybody, thinks that being bad is cool, for some reason. When<br>
   you're in middle school or high school, you think that being bad is cool or<br>
   it's like, ah, bad-ass or whatever. But it changed how I thought because of<br>
   therapy. That I was just angry. I was never a bad kid. I was an actually<br>
   great student and that I was losing all that time in being disrespectful to<br>
   my teachers and my grandparents. And I didn't have to, I was just angry at<br>
   myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: You had a lot of reasons to be angry.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Oh yes, of course I had my reasons, but I had to understand that<br>
   it wasn't my fault. And I had to understand that, yes, it happened, but it<br>
   made me stronger.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: So you didn't want the pregnancy test because you were afraid that<br>
   they would find out that you weren't a virgin?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: No no no. My grandpa wanted to do the pregnancy test. I<br>
   remember... Well my mentor from middle school, we kept fighting about it. I<br>
   didn't want to do it and they asked me why, if I wasn't hiding anything, I<br>
   shouldn’t have been afraid. It was a little bit too much for me. So, I just<br>
   yelled it out. And I said, I was raped. You can do the test. It will not<br>
   work because I'm no longer a virgin. If you want to do the test to verify<br>
   that I'm not pregnant, do it. But my grandpa kept wanting me to do a test<br>
   to see if I was sexually active. Just so he could know, because my family's<br>
   very closed-minded. So he wanted to do it. And I didn't want to, because I<br>
   was afraid and ashamed when he... He was talking like if I wasn't in the<br>
   room. And they were deciding for me, so I just exploded. And I just stated<br>
   that I was raped and to stop, because if he was going to do it, it was okay<br>
   but I wasn't a virgin. Basically, that's why I said it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: But you weren't pregnant?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: No, They did the pregnancy test and everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: So why did people believe you were pregnant?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: So this was like my mentor... Well, my school teacher and<br>
   everybody that was there from my school, they stated that it was going to<br>
   be confidential. So people weren't going to know about this. Nobody was<br>
   going to know about this, but my friend before she left, she started<br>
   spreading rumors. So people wouldn't think that she was the one pregnant.<br>
   And since I got a little bit of time out of school, about a week or so. So<br>
   the rumors kind of like matched per se.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: And you couldn't dispel them?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: I tried to at the beginning, I was like, how could I be pregnant<br>
   and come back to school? And nobody cared. So at some point, I remember<br>
   going to the restroom and some girls beating me up because their boyfriend<br>
   was hitting on me. They stated that I was the one flirting. I was a little<br>
   girl not even knowing about sex that much. And people kept telling me that<br>
   I was a tease and everything. And I remember them hitting me and me not<br>
   doing nothing. I wasn't even-<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: This is so strange because we've heard so many stories about young<br>
   Mexican immigrants who become pregnant. And here it is your story of a<br>
   young Mexican immigrant who didn't become pregnant, but who carried this<br>
   kind of burden-<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: In me. And I remember standing up to the cafeteria and being like,<br>
   I'm not a slut and I've never gotten pregnant and them just throwing food<br>
   at me. So nobody cared, only the teachers did. Not even the principal did<br>
   anything. I don't think it got to that degree that she knew, but only my<br>
   teachers knew about it. And they try to stop them, and whenever they hear<br>
   something mean to me, they were like, hey, stop. But of course they cannot<br>
   control everything. So it was mostly between us, the kids. So at some point<br>
   when I was getting beaten up, I remember just going like, I'm done fighting<br>
   it. If you want to call me a slut, call me a slut.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: So it was that sort of horror treatment and the depression that<br>
   brought you back to<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yeah. My mom actually saw all of that. When I tried to kill myself<br>
   the second time in the car because I did it with pills. Well, fortunately I<br>
   just got really sick, but the second time around my grandma witnessed it.<br>
   So she immediately called my mom.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: So if you'd stayed in the US, if things have been different, what do<br>
   you think you would have done with your life?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Honestly, I would have been depressed still. Maybe I would have<br>
   gotten pregnant at an early age. Maybe I would have dropped out of school<br>
   because of my depression. So actually I thank my mom for bringing me back.<br>
   I mean, a lot of things happened here, of course it wasn't fun either.<br>
   Because I got raped again. But I learned from it. My mom took me to a life<br>
   coach. She's the only one who took me to a psychiatrist, a psychologist.<br>
   And they're the ones who diagnosed me with bipolar, I'm sorry, BPD it's<br>
   borderline personality disorder. So I understood why I was sometimes<br>
   depressed and not even knowing why, because of the traumatic experience.<br>
   And I didn't know how to have ongoing life with it. So I started working<br>
   and honestly, I'm working, yes, because I'm raising money to study because<br>
   the public college that we have here, which is really good UNAM, they don't<br>
   have marketing for... They do have it but as a PhD, you don't have a direct<br>
   degree on it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: What is it that you want to do?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Marketing.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: Marketing.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yes. I wanted to be a psychologist for the longest time, but I<br>
   need to help myself first in order to help others. But I think marketing<br>
   has some hints of psychologyas well, but in a fun way. Like colors and how<br>
   to portray a certain project for any type of audience or customer. So I<br>
   really liked that. And when I was little, I really like commercials and all<br>
   that kind of stuff. And I don't know, I always wanted to do something<br>
   creative, but also that had psychology in it. So I think that's the best of<br>
   both worlds. So I want to study that, but here the one that I want to<br>
   study, it's not cheap. It's really expensive and my mom can't afford it. So<br>
   she helps me out because when I got raped, I got into deep, deep<br>
   depression.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: I used to go to high school here. And my mentor there told me to<br>
   just leave, that I couldn't be in the school anymore because I was<br>
   depressed. And I was always sleepy because I used to take two<br>
   antidepressants. And one quetiapine, it's to slow down your brain, kind of<br>
   like make you sleep a lot. So I was always sleepy. So they just told my mom<br>
   that it was best for me to take some time out. I took some time out. I got<br>
   more depressed because there was nothing to do. So I got more depressed. So<br>
   I didn't finish my high school. So now I'm going to school on the weekends.<br>
   And this job is actually, I think it is quite unfair, but it does allow me<br>
   or at least it respects my working hours. So I have time to study while I'm<br>
   working so I get to pay it.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: As a child though, before you were bullied, before all of this<br>
   happened to you, If this whole pregnancy thing, this whole thing wouldn’t<br>
   have happened, can you imagine what you might've done with your life in the<br>
   US?<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Oh, yes. I might have become a psychologist. Because when I was<br>
   little, I used to be obsessed with it. And I think I might've gone to<br>
   college and maybe become a Dreamer. And maybe not now, but in the future<br>
   maybe had a family.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Anita: Or you could have one here.<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Valeria: Yeah, I could always do that, but I want to be prepared first.<br>
