   because my dad lives there and he wanted me to live with him. I went there<br>
   because of him. While I went there, I was crossed through the border, but I<br>
   really don't remember—I was six years old. I just remember that I was in a<br>
   house, then they took me in a car, and then I woke up at another house, and<br>
   then at another house until I got to California, I think, and that's where<br>
   my dad picked me up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anne: Did you go alone?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, by myself.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who did you leave behind?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I left behind my grandpa, my cousins, my uncles. My mom, mostly,</br>   even though I haven't lived with her, but I left my mom. Some brothers I</br>   have, also. That's what I left behind.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard to leave them behind?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Well, I can remember that part, and it was hard. You're a kid.</br>   You've been living with your grandpa for six years. You know your dad, but</br>   it's not like you have a big memory of him or a bond with him, right? Yeah.</br>   I remember that when I left, I cried. But, when I got to see my father, I</br>   was joyful. I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You went to California?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah—while we lived in Oregon. They dropped me basically off at</br>   California. My dad just went in with a car to California, and then we go</br>   back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was he living in the US with papers?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, he doesn't have papers. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You came over without... Over the border, you crossed the border.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. Just like him, but younger.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He and your mom had split up.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since the beginning, yeah. They never were married or together.</br>   They just had me and that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me about your time in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was fun. I really enjoyed it. I got to make a lot of friends</br>   there. I still talk to them. I still have more than my dad. I have cousins,</br>   uncles, aunts mostly.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A lot of family was already there.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, but most of my cousins are already US citizens since they</br>   were born there—you automatically get your papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was your dad doing while you were living there?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He works. He worked in that time as a manager in Burger King. He</br>   was doing that. Right now he's working, but in another restaurant, equally</br>   has a manager. I think it's Drivers Cruising, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You went to the US, and probably you didn't know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. None.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, it was very hard. In that time, I'm the biggest son of my dad,</br>   and wouldn't have someone to interact with. Mostly it was my cousin. They</br>   lived a few blocks away from us, so I just hanged out with them. Right now</br>   I can remember they were teasing me for not knowing English. It's kind of</br>   fun once you understand, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you start first grade in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, I started second grade, because I finished first grade here.</br>   Over there I started second grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How'd that go?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Well, I think it would have been worse if I didn't have any other</br>   school friends that were also from Mexico and stuff like that. They had the</br>   same problem. They didn't know how to speak English or so, and we got all</br>   in some courses from school. That's mostly where I ended up learning</br>   English. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: English as a second language courses? ESL courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, I think it was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. There were other friends who were Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. Their fathers are Mexicans, and mostly like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you like school? Did you like learning?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a</br>   different way of their system of education. What I liked a lot is that</br>   mostly you get free lunch up in the States, and you get a lot of courses</br>   that are free, and summer activities in school, and they're also free.</br>   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked</br>   it a lot. It's different. I remember my school, they had a big park for a</br>   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you play sports?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played</br>   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Track? Track?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,</br>   too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did</br>   you do music?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not</br>   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I</br>   was up into physical education.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. Cool. Do you make lots of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I remember most of them. I don't know if they remember me,</br>   though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said your Mexican friends really helped you when you were little,</br>   helping you learn the language at all?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you branch out? Did you have friends from all nationalities,</br>   races, or was it mainly did you stick with Mexican friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I stuck with everybody, like African-Americans, US citizens,</br>   Mexican people. Yeah, with everybody.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you feel different?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I never felt different. You never feel different. In my school,</br>   there was no such thing as discrimination or harassments like that, so I</br>   felt good. I wasn't under pressure of students or discrimination or</br>   something like that. It was very good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know you were undocumented? Did you know that that would put</br>   barriers, create barriers for what you could do?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that moment since I was little, I didn't know about the</br>   barriers. I knew I didn't have papers, but I didn't know the consequences</br>   of not having papers. You're little. You would like to play and all that</br>   stuff. Basically, you're a kid, and kids just enjoy life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When did you figure it out?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly when I came here, because in that moment I wasn't really</br>   informed about anything. When I got deported back, I didn't even know about</br>   such things. I thought it would be normal. I didn't even think of having a</br>   job or a social security number, or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I'm 20.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a long story. I had some friends—they were African Americans,</br>   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long</br>   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad</br>   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a</br>   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,</br>   though. Not like the one they have here, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,</br>   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just</br>   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go</br>   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went</br>   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they</br>   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There</br>   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think</br>   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them</br>   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't</br>   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so</br>   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were 15?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Just a child.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The</br>   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, &quot;Hey, you know what? After they</br>   snitch&quot;—and he knew—he was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're about to get</br>   in trouble. We're in a gang.&quot; I really don't remember the name of the gang.</br>   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,</br>   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I didn't see any. I was just like blind. When I got there, I was</br>   blind. I didn't see nothing bad. That's why I didn't suspect anything at</br>   the moment until this guy told me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been in trouble before?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, but not big, big trouble. Since I'm really playful and</br>   anxious, so I need to do something to keep myself calm. In that moment, we</br>   had BB guns, and I didn't know that was bad bringing them to school. I was</br>   getting suspended for that. Also one time, one of our friends took the</br>   little skateboards. I don't remember what the name was, but you can handle</br>   it with your fingers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How big? How big are they?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They're tiny, like this big.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We took all his skateboards from his backpack when we were in</br>   recess. What happened...I didn't know, I thought we’re just going to play</br>   with them. At the end, they told him. His name was Lucious. They told him,</br>   &quot;Hey.&quot; They put me out, like if I were the one who was stealing this stuff.</br>   That was like, &quot;Lucious, Carlos stole your stuff,&quot; and he got mad. He even</br>   hit me, but it's like I didn't even... It's like, &quot;Bro.&quot; It's like, &quot;Why</br>   are you doing this?&quot; Then they explained it to me</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since my grandma—I mostly lived with my grandma back in the</br>   States—didn't know English, every time I was in trouble, my grandma had to</br>   go for me to school and stuff like that. They had one of our friends</br>   translate to her what the teacher or principal was saying.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dad wasn't around?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He wasn't that around because he was working. He mostly works all</br>   day, probably.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It was you and your grandma and him in your house?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, basically. Not really that much in the house, because when I</br>   got there, my dad was hooked up with a girl. I think she was here from</br>   Mexico, too, Puebla, I think. They were together, but that woman, she had a</br>   kid. His name was Eduardo, but he was a US citizen. He's three years older</br>   than me. We got into fights a lot, and she got tired of me. She even kicked</br>   us out. For a few months, it was me and my dad only before my grandma went</br>   to the States. After that, after my grandma got there, I was just living</br>   with my grandma most of the time.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad visited me. And when he got kids, I used to take care of</br>   them when I was in school or my grandma was working, because she also</br>   worked. She was a housekeeper. She had different jobs. Mostly that's what</br>   we were living out of, from the money of my dad and the money that my</br>   grandma was taking out of the housekeeping.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your home life was a little lonely?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the time I was lonely, yeah. Even though in that time, I</br>   enjoyed being lonely because I could go out, go to the park with my</br>   friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hang out with your friends.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, I wasn't bad. I was a good student, but there was one</br>   problem: I was too anxious, so I was always talking, or I was doing</br>   something that got me in trouble.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. You get caught in this robbery that you're unaware of. Then</br>   what? You're 15 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I didn't know what happened, but I was with a judge. I was</br>   little. I really don't remember a lot of stuff. What I do remember is that</br>   they were aware I was a child. I don't think my lawyer spoke with</br>   somebody—I really don't know all the process.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you father come to help?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, he did. We were afraid that he was also going to get deported</br>   of the same situation. Since my grandmother was working for a lot of</br>   houses, one of the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She was undocumented, too?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, my grandma. One of the friends of my grandma, she worked in</br>   her house, she volunteered also to go help me. Basically they ran off with</br>   my dad and lawyer, and the friend, her name was Leanne. I still remember</br>   her. Leanne. I really don't know the process. I was in the correctional—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In a juvenile correctional facility?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you with kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. I was somewhere in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Oregon?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, in ___ Oregon. What basically they told me after the 10 days,</br>   &quot;All right, you need to come back to Mexico.&quot; I needed to come back, so</br>   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with</br>   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to Mexico.</br>   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately</br>   because she has been taking care of me for almost 19 years. Almost 20.</br>   Yeah, almost all my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were sent back, do you know if it was long-term departure or</br>   a deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I just know it was deported. I didn't—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a limit as to when you can apply for a visa to go back to</br>   the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I found out here it is was ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Ten years?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I heard from a friend is that it also takes another ten years,</br>   so it's basically 20. I really don't know what the difference is. They told</br>   me ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: If it's ten years, then you can start the process after ten years. I</br>   don't know how long the process takes. It's been five, right?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Maybe in five years, it won't take as long as it does now. It's</br>   curious because you're a minor.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I also talked about, with some friends</br>   here, when we all talk about our lives. They were like, &quot;Why did you get</br>   deported? You were so young.&quot; Stuff like that. It's like, &quot;Bro, I don't</br>   know. I was young. I didn't know anything until they told me everything.&quot;</br>   You don't realize about things until you're older, and so you know really</br>   what happens, and what are the laws.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You weren't even young enough to know that you couldn't get a</br>   driver's license, or maybe you could in Oregon. I think you can, but you</br>   weren't old enough to know what you couldn't do as an undocumented kid.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you hadn't experienced that. I don't know the laws, but I</br>   imagine that since your family members were undocumented—</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, that's why I think my family didn't put a lot of pressure</br>   into that, because they were also undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They would have been deported, as well.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: If my dad goes, my brothers will be alone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a record? Given that crime, were you convicted of that</br>   crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think not. I'm not sure. I have to ask my dad. He knows all about</br>   it, but we never talk about that stuff. We always talk about, &quot;How are you?</br>   What you've been doing?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: There was a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there a trial for the crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think it was, but I really don't remember</br>   that as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you weren't...</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I don't remember a lot of stuff, mostly because what hit me was</br>   being separated from your dad. I can tell you that with my mom and my dad,</br>   I have lived all my 20 years. I got to see my two brothers little. Right</br>   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I</br>   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my</br>   dad and my brothers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with</br>   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at</br>   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of</br>   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're</br>   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can</br>   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get Saturdays and Sundays off.</br>   I'm barely at their house, but I really appreciate it, that they took care</br>   of me.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the times, I think about what would be different from</br>   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.</br>   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you</br>   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not</br>   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a</br>   teenager. Right now that I’m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't</br>   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would</br>   like, right?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you</br>   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most</br>   important thing is being with your actual family than all the economic</br>   stuff or the money. Most important thing is the love and the relationship</br>   you have with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're a 15 year old kid and you're being deported. Where do they</br>   take you? What do they do with you, the ICE [Immigration and Customs</br>   Enforcement]?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was ten days in the States before they deported me. After that, I</br>   just remember I went to the border, and my family picked me up.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They called your family to have them come pick you up?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly my dad. They came to pick me up, and then we just took a</br>   flight over to Mexico City. That's it. Being here wasn't really easy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your family had been from Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then they brought you back. Hopefully the ICE agents were taking</br>   care of you until you got to them. You were a minor. They must have had the</br>   responsibility to make sure that you got into proper hands. This is</br>   dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Mostly on the border, there's a lot of drug dealers and</br>   cartels and stuff like that, now that I know of. In the moment, I really</br>   didn't know about anything. I didn't really care about Mexico anymore. I</br>   was hoping I would stay there for a long time, grow up, get a job,</br>   probably. Finish college. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dreams in the US were to do what?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: To study and get a job, and to live there, getting a partner, to</br>   get married, and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who met you? Which family met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was the family from my father. My grandpa that I lived with, and</br>   some aunts.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know them?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. Yeah, because in here when I was little, I used to the with</br>   them a lot of time. Even here before I went to the States, I was mischief.</br>   To be honest, my situation in school has always been problems, problems,</br>   problems because here in Mexico I used to get into the ceilings of the</br>   schools, and throwing pencils, and hitting people, and all this stuff. That</br>   was when I was here. I usually went to a school that was most for kids that</br>   are misbehaving.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Even when you were six?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. When I was six. I got expelled from a school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In kindergarten or first grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: First grade. It all happened in first grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think that's why your dad brought you to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. He mostly wanted me back because he wanted to be with me,</br>   right? I don't know a father, or maybe there are some cases, but I don't</br>   know of a father that wouldn't like to be with their children.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You never got expelled from a school in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, never. Yeah. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did good.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Great. You came back, resumed living where you had lived in the first</br>   six years of your life?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, in the same house.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me how you felt.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was hard because I felt sad at the moment not being with my dad</br>   and my brothers. Another part, I felt kind good because I had my uncles and</br>   my grandpas. One of my uncles that lived here is one of the ones that I</br>   loved the most, apart from my dad. That was kinda a relief. You put</br>   something bad and put another good thing on top of that, it just kind of</br>   mixes, and at the end, I'm here. That's what I think, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far have you gotten in school? You were 15, so?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think it was seventh grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Seventh?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Seventh. Up in the States, seventh grade, something like that. When</br>   I got here, I finished middle school. I don't know what grade. It was</br>   eighth grade, I think? Something like that. Here, they handle it different,</br>   because you have elementary school, six years, then middle school, three</br>   years, and after that, high school that is also three years, and off to</br>   college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard getting back into the school system here?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, very hard. Very, very hard. Mostly because I was so into</br>   English and the subjects—well, I don't think they differ a lot, but</br>   obviously history isn't the same. Most of the things aren't the same.</br>   Civics aren't also the same. They have different ones here or there.</br>   Spanish, they have here Spanish, that's a subject. I was like, &quot;What are</br>   these?&quot; They have little, I don't know, like this. This thing right here.</br>   [pointing to accents]</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was like, &quot;Where do you put that? Why do you put that?&quot; Yeah, it</br>   was very hard for me because, for instance, I didn't talk a lot of Spanish.</br>   I didn't know a lot of Spanish.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you learned to read Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had to?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, because even right now, I don't like to read in</br>   Spanish. I prefer English. If somebody gets me a book, &quot;You know what? Can</br>   you get me a book, but it’s English?&quot; Because I don't like reading in</br>   Spanish a lot, mostly because of the practice, you know? I want to keep my</br>   English a little bit more fluid. Right now having a little bit of troubles</br>   pronouncing words and stuff like that, because it’s not the same. You speak</br>   it every day and write it every day up in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Over here, you speak Spanish. Here, the system of education for</br>   English is very bad. It's very bad. I always try to hear music in English,</br>   and read books, and stuff like that, and watch movies in English because if</br>   you don't practice it, you'll forget it. You'll forget it. Once you're</br>   older, it is very difficult or is more difficult to learn a language than</br>   when you were little. Getting back here was [Pow sound].</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They even thought it would be better if I started middle school,</br>   but from the beginning, not onto the third grade that I was supposed to be.</br>   No, in first grade because I didn't know Spanish, and most of the subjects</br>   that are needed for Spanish. I was great in English. They took my English</br>   classes away so I can retake Spanish, but on second level. They were</br>   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I</br>   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I</br>   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,</br>   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,</br>   school was like, I care about it, but not 100%. Since I like soccer, I used</br>   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.</br>   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like</br>   that. They even paid me classes for Spanish and for another subject into</br>   Spanish, so I didn't really have a hard time. I spent two years in those</br>   classes. After that, I'm normal. I can talk Spanish normally and all that</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far have you gotten in high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Let's say I finished. I already went past through the last grade,</br>   that is the third grade here, but I still haven't passed six subjects. So,</br>   I don't have my certificates. I haven't finished high school still.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Will you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I will, and I want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does it mean taking tests, or does it mean actually taking courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Taking the test of the subjects that you haven't passed, and most</br>   of them are very difficult. I studied in my school. It's from the, I don't</br>   know if you heard of Instituto Politécnico Nacional.</br> </br> </br>   .</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It's the high schools from that institute. All of them have</br>   specialties. They got construction, they got electricity. There's, how can</br>   I say it? There's also for the planes, and how to fix them for mechanics,</br>   cars. There's another one, but I really don't know. It's industrial</br>   processes or something like that? That would be the translation of what I</br>   know of.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I got electricity, but the subjects that I failed on are the</br>   hardest ones. To be true, I have been trying to finish it for five years.</br>   From the point I got into school, first grade, second grade, and third</br>   grade, I have taken five years and counting. I really want to finish high</br>   school, because it helps speaking English, mostly because they don't have a</br>   lot of jobs that are well paid here. Having to know or getting to speak</br>   English is a bonus. Right now, I'm in a job that, they don't pay you that</br>   bad if you're single, you don't have kids, it's okay, but once you have a</br>   family? No. It's not a lot of money for having a family. It's just for one</br>   person.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is that job?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a call center right here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Teletech?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, Teletech, right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long you been working there?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I have two months, but I've been working into Vista,</br>   CompuCom, CCSI, it's one right there on that street.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why do you keep changing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: On the first one, my first job was 2017, I was still studying. In</br>   that time, I didn't have my subjects, not a pass or anything. I was good. I</br>   always studied in the afternoon. It was from 2:00 to 10:00. I worked from</br>   8:00 to 3:00. I was half-time, but I really couldn't, it was a lot of</br>   pressure, and I was like, &quot;You know what? I'm going to quit. It's okay. I</br>   may want money, but I think it's not the time.&quot; Then after that, I worked</br>   at CompuCom. That's more technical service related. It's not like you're</br>   assisting customers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: You're assisting the users of a company, the people who work there,</br>   not the customers. I like that a lot. It's more technical support. It's</br>   better than customer service. Customer service, you get a lot of angry</br>   customers, and they yell at you, and all that stuff [Anne laughs]. That's</br>   where I worked. I worked there six months—that was one year after. In that</br>   time, I already finished, partially finished, school. I was there to make</br>   money, because I decided that it was time for me to work, and I started</br>   making money.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that point, I had some problems with my grandma and my grandpa,</br>   so I left the house. I met there in CompuCom before that a guy, and we were</br>   best friends. We were always together. He was like, &quot;Hey, if anything</br>   happens, you can go to my house, to my crib,&quot; and all that stuff. Like,</br>   &quot;Okay, bet.&quot; We even took our stuff, my stuff from my house all the way to</br>   his house. It's a two-hour trip.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's [foreign – location/Insurgentes 00:40:26], basically. I was</br>   good with him, but in that moment, something happened: I started drinking</br>   and stuff, so I really much care less for my job, started going down, and</br>   stuff like that. I got fired eventually.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Kind of, because the problems that I also had with my family took</br>   over the situation. With him, I bought a lot of stuff. I bought shoes,</br>   shirts, and all that stuff. I was living with him until August. That's when</br>   my mom contacted me. She lives right now in Queretaro. I was just going to</br>   visit her for two or three weeks, but I stayed two months. I stayed two</br>   months with her and with my brothers—half-brothers, if I can say that.</br>   After I came back with this guy again, something happened.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When we were together, he didn't hang out with people like robbers</br>   and stuff like that, but when I was back, you can see all the people right</br>   there. Changing things from the cars, and stealing them, stuff like that.</br>   Yeah. I don't know what happened in his head in that moment, but he threw</br>   me from his house basically with nothing. I didn't have anything left. From</br>   that, I was living on different towns, if you can say. Towns? Until I got</br>   back with my grandparents. We arrange things again, and we got into an</br>   agreement.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I have been living with them since that. That's mostly what—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are you staying out of trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, totally. No more trouble. After that incident, I worked here</br>   at CCSI, but I didn't like it because the supervisors didn't have any… How</br>   can I say it? They didn't have a good organization. They set your breaks</br>   and lunch in certain times. For example, I entered at 2:00. I had my first</br>   break for 15 minutes from 3:00 to 3:15. Then I had my lunch from—it was</br>   half an hour by the way—from 4:00 for 4:30. I had my second break until</br>   9:00 to 9:15, and I didn't like that.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When you had your days off, there wasn't a way that they could tell</br>   you. When you got into the floor, it was like, &quot;Why do you come? You got</br>   your day today. You're not supposed to come.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why don't you</br>   tell us before?&quot; A day before?” I didn't like that. The payment was weekly.</br>   It was not that bad, but I didn't like it. That's when I applied here at</br>   TeleTech. I like it so far. It's good, and the best thing is that I don't</br>   have credentials, so I'm not working.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What does that mean?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Basically in call centers, you have 60 people, and your max</br>   is for 70. A new wave comes in, maybe 15 people, and the five people that</br>   are left—since you already took all of the capacity you're supposed to have</br>   for agents and the rest of them don't have credentials—don't do anything.</br>   You don't work. Let's say you don't work. You just wake up to come to work</br>   and not do anything. That's what not having credentials means.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're getting paid for nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll take it.&quot; Even so, in training, I</br>   consider myself as one of the best of all my wave, because I have the</br>   knowledge, and even though I don't do nothing, they ask me, &quot;Hey, how do</br>   you do this? What's this?&quot; I can tell them. That's not a problem to me. If</br>   I get my credential today, it's like, &quot;You know what? Yeah. Give me them,</br>   I'll start working like I'm supposed to be.&quot; You go to work to have money.</br>   That work, if it applies some responsibilities, you have to do them,</br>   because otherwise, why would you be working? If you don't want to have</br>   responsibilities, you rather be something else, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about socially? Has it been hard to adjust socially, make</br>   friends, girlfriends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. No. The people I have met, they actually helped me here. They</br>   helped me study and everything, so that wasn't a problem at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss most?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad. I miss my dad. Yeah. I miss him. I remember when we used to</br>   go to field trips, and when he took me to his job, when we went to go watch</br>   movies, to the parks, and stuff like that. It's not like any more, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Neither of you ?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We talk through Messenger, WhatsApp, and through phone, right? I</br>   call him or he calls me, and we keep in touch like that. That's the way we</br>   can talk with each other, but right now since I don't have a phone, it's a</br>   little bit harder. If you don't have a phone, you don't have access to</br>   WhatsApp and Messenger. You have to go to a computer, maybe in your house,</br>   maybe in the local. Sometimes you don't have that time to actually go</br>   there, like having your cell phone right on hand. Having mobile data or</br>   WiFi is very different. You can go on the metro, or go on the metro bus, or</br>   in a bus, in a car, and still be talking with him. In this case, I have to</br>   be in a certain spot to actually talk to him. so yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What are your dreams now, now that you're here?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="660e8b56-14c6-4f0e-851f-0a814e9c4eb0" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Dreams, Relationships, Jobs, College">Carlos: The most important one is finish high school. After that, I want to<br>
   study software engineer, and I like it a lot. I like it a lot. I want to<br>
   get into a good job. Right now, I have a girlfriend. When I needed it, she<br>
   was there for me. I have a very good relationship with her, and I feel a<br>
   lot of love for her. If things can happen in the future, I'm willing to<br>
   take it. I'd take it. I'll take it because not a lot of girls will help you<br>
   the way she helped me, because most of them are not interested on who you<br>
   are or what you need, and she was in the moment when I needed it.<br>

   I have lived all my 20 years. I got to see my two brothers little. Right<br>
   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I<br>
   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my<br>
   dad and my brothers.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with<br>
   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at<br>
   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of<br>
   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're<br>
   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can<br>
   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get Saturdays and Sundays off.<br>

   of me.<br>

   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.<br>
   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you<br>
   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not<br>
   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a<br>
   teenager. Right now that I’m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't<br>
   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would<br>
   like, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you<br>
   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most<br>

   that are free, and summer activities in school, and they're also free.<br>
   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked<br>

He worked in that time as a manager in Burger King. He</br>   was doing that. Right now he's working, but in another restaurant, equally</br>   has a manager. I think it's Drivers Cruising, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You went to the US, and probably you didn't know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. None.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, it was very hard. In that time, I'm the biggest son of my dad,</br>   and wouldn't have someone to interact with. Mostly it was my cousin. They</br>   lived a few blocks away from us, so I just hanged out with them. Right now</br>   I can remember they were teasing me for not knowing English. It's kind of</br>   fun once you understand, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you start first grade in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, I started second grade, because I finished first grade here.</br>   Over there I started second grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How'd that go?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Well, I think it would have been worse if I didn't have any other</br>   school friends that were also from Mexico and stuff like that. They had the</br>   same problem. They didn't know how to speak English or so, and we got all</br>   in some courses from school. That's mostly where I ended up learning</br>   English. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: English as a second language courses? ESL courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, I think it was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. There were other friends who were Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. Their fathers are Mexicans, and mostly like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you like school? Did you like learning?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a</br>   different way of their system of education. What I liked a lot is that</br>   mostly you get free lunch up in the States, and you get a lot of courses</br>   that are free, and summer activities in school, and they're also free.</br>   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked</br>   it a lot. It's different. I remember my school, they had a big park for a</br>   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you play sports?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played</br>   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Track? Track?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,</br>   too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did</br>   you do music?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not</br>   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I</br>   was up into physical education.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. Cool. Do you make lots of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I remember most of them. I don't know if they remember me,</br>   though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said your Mexican friends really helped you when you were little,</br>   helping you learn the language at all?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you branch out? Did you have friends from all nationalities,</br>   races, or was it mainly did you stick with Mexican friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I stuck with everybody, like African-Americans, US citizens,</br>   Mexican people. Yeah, with everybody.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you feel different?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I never felt different. You never feel different. In my school,</br>   there was no such thing as discrimination or harassments like that, so I</br>   felt good. I wasn't under pressure of students or discrimination or</br>   something like that. It was very good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know you were undocumented? Did you know that that would put</br>   barriers, create barriers for what you could do?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that moment since I was little, I didn't know about the</br>   barriers. I knew I didn't have papers, but I didn't know the consequences</br>   of not having papers. You're little. You would like to play and all that</br>   stuff. Basically, you're a kid, and kids just enjoy life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When did you figure it out?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly when I came here, because in that moment I wasn't really</br>   informed about anything. When I got deported back, I didn't even know about</br>   such things. I thought it would be normal. I didn't even think of having a</br>   job or a social security number, or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I'm 20.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a long story. I had some friends—they were African Americans,</br>   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long</br>   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad</br>   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a</br>   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,</br>   though. Not like the one they have here, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,</br>   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just</br>   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go</br>   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went</br>   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they</br>   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There</br>   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think</br>   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them</br>   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't</br>   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so</br>   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were 15?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Just a child.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The</br>   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, &quot;Hey, you know what? After they</br>   snitch&quot;—and he knew—he was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're about to get</br>   in trouble. We're in a gang.&quot; I really don't remember the name of the gang.</br>   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,</br>   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I didn't see any. I was just like blind. When I got there, I was</br>   blind. I didn't see nothing bad. That's why I didn't suspect anything at</br>   the moment until this guy told me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been in trouble before?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, but not big, big trouble. Since I'm really playful and</br>   anxious, so I need to do something to keep myself calm. In that moment, we</br>   had BB guns, and I didn't know that was bad bringing them to school. I was</br>   getting suspended for that. Also one time, one of our friends took the</br>   little skateboards. I don't remember what the name was, but you can handle</br>   it with your fingers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How big? How big are they?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They're tiny, like this big.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We took all his skateboards from his backpack when we were in</br>   recess. What happened...I didn't know, I thought we’re just going to play</br>   with them. At the end, they told him. His name was Lucious. They told him,</br>   &quot;Hey.&quot; They put me out, like if I were the one who was stealing this stuff.</br>   That was like, &quot;Lucious, Carlos stole your stuff,&quot; and he got mad. He even</br>   hit me, but it's like I didn't even... It's like, &quot;Bro.&quot; It's like, &quot;Why</br>   are you doing this?&quot; Then they explained it to me</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since my grandma—I mostly lived with my grandma back in the</br>   States—didn't know English, every time I was in trouble, my grandma had to</br>   go for me to school and stuff like that. They had one of our friends</br>   translate to her what the teacher or principal was saying.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dad wasn't around?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He wasn't that around because he was working. He mostly works all</br>   day, probably.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It was you and your grandma and him in your house?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, basically. Not really that much in the house, because when I</br>   got there, my dad was hooked up with a girl. I think she was here from</br>   Mexico, too, Puebla, I think. They were together, but that woman, she had a</br>   kid. His name was Eduardo, but he was a US citizen. He's three years older</br>   than me. We got into fights a lot, and she got tired of me. She even kicked</br>   us out. For a few months, it was me and my dad only before my grandma went</br>   to the States. After that, after my grandma got there, I was just living</br>   with my grandma most of the time.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad visited me. And when he got kids, I used to take care of</br>   them when I was in school or my grandma was working, because she also</br>   worked. She was a housekeeper. She had different jobs. Mostly that's what</br>   we were living out of, from the money of my dad and the money that my</br>   grandma was taking out of the housekeeping.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your home life was a little lonely?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the time I was lonely, yeah. Even though in that time, I</br>   enjoyed being lonely because I could go out, go to the park with my</br>   friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hang out with your friends.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, I wasn't bad. I was a good student, but there was one</br>   problem: I was too anxious, so I was always talking, or I was doing</br>   something that got me in trouble.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. You get caught in this robbery that you're unaware of. Then</br>   what? You're 15 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I didn't know what happened, but I was with a judge. I was</br>   little. I really don't remember a lot of stuff. What I do remember is that</br>   they were aware I was a child. I don't think my lawyer spoke with</br>   somebody—I really don't know all the process.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you father come to help?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, he did. We were afraid that he was also going to get deported</br>   of the same situation. Since my grandmother was working for a lot of</br>   houses, one of the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She was undocumented, too?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, my grandma. One of the friends of my grandma, she worked in</br>   her house, she volunteered also to go help me. Basically they ran off with</br>   my dad and lawyer, and the friend, her name was Leanne. I still remember</br>   her. Leanne. I really don't know the process. I was in the correctional—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In a juvenile correctional facility?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you with kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. I was somewhere in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Oregon?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="e6ab61cd-4775-48c4-8479-5c675eac0b7d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reasons, Deportation">Carlos: Yeah, in ___ Oregon. What basically they told me after the 10 days,<br>
   &quot;All right, you need to come back to Mexico.&quot; I needed to come back, so<br>
   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with<br>
   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to Mexico.<br>
   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately<br>
   because she has been taking care of me for almost 19 years. Almost 20.<br>
   Yeah, almost all my life.<br>

I remember my school, they had a big park for a</br>   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you play sports?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played</br>   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Track? Track?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,</br>   too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did</br>   you do music?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not</br>   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I</br>   was up into physical education.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. Cool. Do you make lots of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I remember most of them. I don't know if they remember me,</br>   though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said your Mexican friends really helped you when you were little,</br>   helping you learn the language at all?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you branch out? Did you have friends from all nationalities,</br>   races, or was it mainly did you stick with Mexican friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I stuck with everybody, like African-Americans, US citizens,</br>   Mexican people. Yeah, with everybody.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you feel different?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I never felt different. You never feel different. In my school,</br>   there was no such thing as discrimination or harassments like that, so I</br>   felt good. I wasn't under pressure of students or discrimination or</br>   something like that. It was very good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know you were undocumented? Did you know that that would put</br>   barriers, create barriers for what you could do?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that moment since I was little, I didn't know about the</br>   barriers. I knew I didn't have papers, but I didn't know the consequences</br>   of not having papers. You're little. You would like to play and all that</br>   stuff. Basically, you're a kid, and kids just enjoy life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When did you figure it out?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly when I came here, because in that moment I wasn't really</br>   informed about anything. When I got deported back, I didn't even know about</br>   such things. I thought it would be normal. I didn't even think of having a</br>   job or a social security number, or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I'm 20.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a long story. I had some friends—they were African Americans,</br>   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long</br>   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad</br>   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a</br>   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,</br>   though. Not like the one they have here, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,</br>   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just</br>   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go</br>   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went</br>   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they</br>   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There</br>   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think</br>   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them</br>   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't</br>   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so</br>   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were 15?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Just a child.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The</br>   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, &quot;Hey, you know what? After they</br>   snitch&quot;—and he knew—he was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're about to get</br>   in trouble. We're in a gang.&quot; I really don't remember the name of the gang.</br>   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,</br>   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I didn't see any. I was just like blind. When I got there, I was</br>   blind. I didn't see nothing bad. That's why I didn't suspect anything at</br>   the moment until this guy told me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been in trouble before?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, but not big, big trouble. Since I'm really playful and</br>   anxious, so I need to do something to keep myself calm. In that moment, we</br>   had BB guns, and I didn't know that was bad bringing them to school. I was</br>   getting suspended for that. Also one time, one of our friends took the</br>   little skateboards. I don't remember what the name was, but you can handle</br>   it with your fingers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How big? How big are they?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They're tiny, like this big.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We took all his skateboards from his backpack when we were in</br>   recess. What happened...I didn't know, I thought we’re just going to play</br>   with them. At the end, they told him. His name was Lucious. They told him,</br>   &quot;Hey.&quot; They put me out, like if I were the one who was stealing this stuff.</br>   That was like, &quot;Lucious, Carlos stole your stuff,&quot; and he got mad. He even</br>   hit me, but it's like I didn't even... It's like, &quot;Bro.&quot; It's like, &quot;Why</br>   are you doing this?&quot; Then they explained it to me</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since my grandma—I mostly lived with my grandma back in the</br>   States—didn't know English, every time I was in trouble, my grandma had to</br>   go for me to school and stuff like that. They had one of our friends</br>   translate to her what the teacher or principal was saying.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dad wasn't around?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He wasn't that around because he was working. He mostly works all</br>   day, probably.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It was you and your grandma and him in your house?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, basically. Not really that much in the house, because when I</br>   got there, my dad was hooked up with a girl. I think she was here from</br>   Mexico, too, Puebla, I think. They were together, but that woman, she had a</br>   kid. His name was Eduardo, but he was a US citizen. He's three years older</br>   than me. We got into fights a lot, and she got tired of me. She even kicked</br>   us out. For a few months, it was me and my dad only before my grandma went</br>   to the States. After that, after my grandma got there, I was just living</br>   with my grandma most of the time.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad visited me. And when he got kids, I used to take care of</br>   them when I was in school or my grandma was working, because she also</br>   worked. She was a housekeeper. She had different jobs. Mostly that's what</br>   we were living out of, from the money of my dad and the money that my</br>   grandma was taking out of the housekeeping.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your home life was a little lonely?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the time I was lonely, yeah. Even though in that time, I</br>   enjoyed being lonely because I could go out, go to the park with my</br>   friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hang out with your friends.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, I wasn't bad. I was a good student, but there was one</br>   problem: I was too anxious, so I was always talking, or I was doing</br>   something that got me in trouble.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. You get caught in this robbery that you're unaware of. Then</br>   what? You're 15 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I didn't know what happened, but I was with a judge. I was</br>   little. I really don't remember a lot of stuff. What I do remember is that</br>   they were aware I was a child. I don't think my lawyer spoke with</br>   somebody—I really don't know all the process.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you father come to help?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, he did. We were afraid that he was also going to get deported</br>   of the same situation. Since my grandmother was working for a lot of</br>   houses, one of the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She was undocumented, too?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, my grandma. One of the friends of my grandma, she worked in</br>   her house, she volunteered also to go help me. Basically they ran off with</br>   my dad and lawyer, and the friend, her name was Leanne. I still remember</br>   her. Leanne. I really don't know the process. I was in the correctional—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In a juvenile correctional facility?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you with kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. I was somewhere in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Oregon?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, in ___ Oregon. What basically they told me after the 10 days,</br>   &quot;All right, you need to come back to Mexico.&quot; I needed to come back, so</br>   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with</br>   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to Mexico.</br>   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately</br>   because she has been taking care of me for almost 19 years. Almost 20.</br>   Yeah, almost all my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were sent back, do you know if it was long-term departure or</br>   a deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I just know it was deported. I didn't—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a limit as to when you can apply for a visa to go back to</br>   the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I found out here it is was ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Ten years?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I heard from a friend is that it also takes another ten years,</br>   so it's basically 20. I really don't know what the difference is. They told</br>   me ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: If it's ten years, then you can start the process after ten years. I</br>   don't know how long the process takes. It's been five, right?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Maybe in five years, it won't take as long as it does now. It's</br>   curious because you're a minor.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I also talked about, with some friends</br>   here, when we all talk about our lives. They were like, &quot;Why did you get</br>   deported? You were so young.&quot; Stuff like that. It's like, &quot;Bro, I don't</br>   know. I was young. I didn't know anything until they told me everything.&quot;</br>   You don't realize about things until you're older, and so you know really</br>   what happens, and what are the laws.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You weren't even young enough to know that you couldn't get a</br>   driver's license, or maybe you could in Oregon. I think you can, but you</br>   weren't old enough to know what you couldn't do as an undocumented kid.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you hadn't experienced that. I don't know the laws, but I</br>   imagine that since your family members were undocumented—</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, that's why I think my family didn't put a lot of pressure</br>   into that, because they were also undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They would have been deported, as well.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: If my dad goes, my brothers will be alone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a record? Given that crime, were you convicted of that</br>   crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think not. I'm not sure. I have to ask my dad. He knows all about</br>   it, but we never talk about that stuff. We always talk about, &quot;How are you?</br>   What you've been doing?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: There was a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there a trial for the crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think it was, but I really don't remember</br>   that as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you weren't...</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I don't remember a lot of stuff, mostly because what hit me was</br>   being separated from your dad. I can tell you that with my mom and my dad,</br>   I have lived all my 20 years. I got to see my two brothers little. Right</br>   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I</br>   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my</br>   dad and my brothers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with</br>   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at</br>   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of</br>   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're</br>   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can</br>   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get Saturdays and Sundays off.</br>   I'm barely at their house, but I really appreciate it, that they took care</br>   of me.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the times, I think about what would be different from</br>   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.</br>   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you</br>   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not</br>   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a</br>   teenager. Right now that I’m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't</br>   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would</br>   like, right?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you</br>   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most</br>   important thing is being with your actual family than all the economic</br>   stuff or the money. Most important thing is the love and the relationship</br>   you have with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're a 15 year old kid and you're being deported. Where do they</br>   take you? What do they do with you, the ICE [Immigration and Customs</br>   Enforcement]?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was ten days in the States before they deported me. After that, I</br>   just remember I went to the border, and my family picked me up.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They called your family to have them come pick you up?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly my dad. They came to pick me up, and then we just took a</br>   flight over to Mexico City. That's it. Being here wasn't really easy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your family had been from Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then they brought you back. Hopefully the ICE agents were taking</br>   care of you until you got to them. You were a minor. They must have had the</br>   responsibility to make sure that you got into proper hands. This is</br>   dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Mostly on the border, there's a lot of drug dealers and</br>   cartels and stuff like that, now that I know of. In the moment, I really</br>   didn't know about anything. I didn't really care about Mexico anymore. I</br>   was hoping I would stay there for a long time, grow up, get a job,</br>   probably. Finish college. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dreams in the US were to do what?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: To study and get a job, and to live there, getting a partner, to</br>   get married, and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who met you? Which family met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was the family from my father. My grandpa that I lived with, and</br>   some aunts.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know them?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. Yeah, because in here when I was little, I used to the with</br>   them a lot of time. Even here before I went to the States, I was mischief.</br>   To be honest, my situation in school has always been problems, problems,</br>   problems because here in Mexico I used to get into the ceilings of the</br>   schools, and throwing pencils, and hitting people, and all this stuff. That</br>   was when I was here. I usually went to a school that was most for kids that</br>   are misbehaving.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Even when you were six?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. When I was six. I got expelled from a school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In kindergarten or first grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: First grade. It all happened in first grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think that's why your dad brought you to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. He mostly wanted me back because he wanted to be with me,</br>   right? I don't know a father, or maybe there are some cases, but I don't</br>   know of a father that wouldn't like to be with their children.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You never got expelled from a school in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, never. Yeah. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did good.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Great. You came back, resumed living where you had lived in the first</br>   six years of your life?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, in the same house.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me how you felt.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was hard because I felt sad at the moment not being with my dad</br>   and my brothers. Another part, I felt kind good because I had my uncles and</br>   my grandpas. One of my uncles that lived here is one of the ones that I</br>   loved the most, apart from my dad. That was kinda a relief. You put</br>   something bad and put another good thing on top of that, it just kind of</br>   mixes, and at the end, I'm here. That's what I think, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far have you gotten in school? You were 15, so?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think it was seventh grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Seventh?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Seventh. Up in the States, seventh grade, something like that. When</br>   I got here, I finished middle school. I don't know what grade. It was</br>   eighth grade, I think? Something like that. Here, they handle it different,</br>   because you have elementary school, six years, then middle school, three</br>   years, and after that, high school that is also three years, and off to</br>   college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard getting back into the school system here?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, very hard. Very, very hard. Mostly because I was so into</br>   English and the subjects—well, I don't think they differ a lot, but</br>   obviously history isn't the same. Most of the things aren't the same.</br>   Civics aren't also the same. They have different ones here or there.</br>   Spanish, they have here Spanish, that's a subject. I was like, &quot;What are</br>   these?&quot; They have little, I don't know, like this. This thing right here.</br>   [pointing to accents]</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was like, &quot;Where do you put that? Why do you put that?&quot; Yeah, it</br>   was very hard for me because, for instance, I didn't talk a lot of Spanish.</br>   I didn't know a lot of Spanish.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you learned to read Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had to?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, because even right now, I don't like to read in</br>   Spanish. I prefer English. If somebody gets me a book, &quot;You know what? Can</br>   you get me a book, but it’s English?&quot; Because I don't like reading in</br>   Spanish a lot, mostly because of the practice, you know? I want to keep my</br>   English a little bit more fluid. Right now having a little bit of troubles</br>   pronouncing words and stuff like that, because it’s not the same. You speak</br>   it every day and write it every day up in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Over here, you speak Spanish. Here, the system of education for</br>   English is very bad. It's very bad. I always try to hear music in English,</br>   and read books, and stuff like that, and watch movies in English because if</br>   you don't practice it, you'll forget it. You'll forget it. Once you're</br>   older, it is very difficult or is more difficult to learn a language than</br>   when you were little. Getting back here was [Pow sound].</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They even thought it would be better if I started middle school,</br>   but from the beginning, not onto the third grade that I was supposed to be.</br>   No, in first grade because I didn't know Spanish, and most of the subjects</br>   that are needed for Spanish. I was great in English. They took my English</br>   classes away so I can retake Spanish, but on second level. They were</br>   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I</br>   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I</br>   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,</br>   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,</br>   school was like, I care about it, but not 100%. Since I like soccer, I used</br>   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.</br>   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like</br>   that. They even paid me classes for Spanish and for another subject into</br>   Spanish, so I didn't really have a hard time. I spent two years in those</br>   classes. After that, I'm normal. I can talk Spanish normally and all that</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far have you gotten in high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Let's say I finished. I already went past through the last grade,</br>   that is the third grade here, but I still haven't passed six subjects. So,</br>   I don't have my certificates. I haven't finished high school still.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Will you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I will, and I want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does it mean taking tests, or does it mean actually taking courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Taking the test of the subjects that you haven't passed, and most</br>   of them are very difficult. I studied in my school. It's from the, I don't</br>   know if you heard of Instituto Politécnico Nacional.</br> </br> </br>   .</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It's the high schools from that institute. All of them have</br>   specialties. They got construction, they got electricity. There's, how can</br>   I say it? There's also for the planes, and how to fix them for mechanics,</br>   cars. There's another one, but I really don't know. It's industrial</br>   processes or something like that? That would be the translation of what I</br>   know of.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I got electricity, but the subjects that I failed on are the</br>   hardest ones. To be true, I have been trying to finish it for five years.</br>   From the point I got into school, first grade, second grade, and third</br>   grade, I have taken five years and counting. I really want to finish high</br>   school, because it helps speaking English, mostly because they don't have a</br>   lot of jobs that are well paid here. Having to know or getting to speak</br>   English is a bonus. Right now, I'm in a job that, they don't pay you that</br>   bad if you're single, you don't have kids, it's okay, but once you have a</br>   family? No. It's not a lot of money for having a family. It's just for one</br>   person.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is that job?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a call center right here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Teletech?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, Teletech, right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long you been working there?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I have two months, but I've been working into Vista,</br>   CompuCom, CCSI, it's one right there on that street.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why do you keep changing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: On the first one, my first job was 2017, I was still studying. In</br>   that time, I didn't have my subjects, not a pass or anything. I was good. I</br>   always studied in the afternoon. It was from 2:00 to 10:00. I worked from</br>   8:00 to 3:00. I was half-time, but I really couldn't, it was a lot of</br>   pressure, and I was like, &quot;You know what? I'm going to quit. It's okay. I</br>   may want money, but I think it's not the time.&quot; Then after that, I worked</br>   at CompuCom. That's more technical service related. It's not like you're</br>   assisting customers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: You're assisting the users of a company, the people who work there,</br>   not the customers. I like that a lot. It's more technical support. It's</br>   better than customer service. Customer service, you get a lot of angry</br>   customers, and they yell at you, and all that stuff [Anne laughs]. That's</br>   where I worked. I worked there six months—that was one year after. In that</br>   time, I already finished, partially finished, school. I was there to make</br>   money, because I decided that it was time for me to work, and I started</br>   making money.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that point, I had some problems with my grandma and my grandpa,</br>   so I left the house. I met there in CompuCom before that a guy, and we were</br>   best friends. We were always together. He was like, &quot;Hey, if anything</br>   happens, you can go to my house, to my crib,&quot; and all that stuff. Like,</br>   &quot;Okay, bet.&quot; We even took our stuff, my stuff from my house all the way to</br>   his house. It's a two-hour trip.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's [foreign – location/Insurgentes 00:40:26], basically. I was</br>   good with him, but in that moment, something happened: I started drinking</br>   and stuff, so I really much care less for my job, started going down, and</br>   stuff like that. I got fired eventually.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Kind of, because the problems that I also had with my family took</br>   over the situation. With him, I bought a lot of stuff. I bought shoes,</br>   shirts, and all that stuff. I was living with him until August. That's when</br>   my mom contacted me. She lives right now in Queretaro. I was just going to</br>   visit her for two or three weeks, but I stayed two months. I stayed two</br>   months with her and with my brothers—half-brothers, if I can say that.</br>   After I came back with this guy again, something happened.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When we were together, he didn't hang out with people like robbers</br>   and stuff like that, but when I was back, you can see all the people right</br>   there. Changing things from the cars, and stealing them, stuff like that.</br>   Yeah. I don't know what happened in his head in that moment, but he threw</br>   me from his house basically with nothing. I didn't have anything left. From</br>   that, I was living on different towns, if you can say. Towns? Until I got</br>   back with my grandparents. We arrange things again, and we got into an</br>   agreement.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I have been living with them since that. That's mostly what—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are you staying out of trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, totally. No more trouble. After that incident, I worked here</br>   at CCSI, but I didn't like it because the supervisors didn't have any… How</br>   can I say it? They didn't have a good organization. They set your breaks</br>   and lunch in certain times. For example, I entered at 2:00. I had my first</br>   break for 15 minutes from 3:00 to 3:15. Then I had my lunch from—it was</br>   half an hour by the way—from 4:00 for 4:30. I had my second break until</br>   9:00 to 9:15, and I didn't like that.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When you had your days off, there wasn't a way that they could tell</br>   you. When you got into the floor, it was like, &quot;Why do you come? You got</br>   your day today. You're not supposed to come.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why don't you</br>   tell us before?&quot; A day before?” I didn't like that. The payment was weekly.</br>   It was not that bad, but I didn't like it. That's when I applied here at</br>   TeleTech. I like it so far. It's good, and the best thing is that I don't</br>   have credentials, so I'm not working.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What does that mean?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Basically in call centers, you have 60 people, and your max</br>   is for 70. A new wave comes in, maybe 15 people, and the five people that</br>   are left—since you already took all of the capacity you're supposed to have</br>   for agents and the rest of them don't have credentials—don't do anything.</br>   You don't work. Let's say you don't work. You just wake up to come to work</br>   and not do anything. That's what not having credentials means.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're getting paid for nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll take it.&quot; Even so, in training, I</br>   consider myself as one of the best of all my wave, because I have the</br>   knowledge, and even though I don't do nothing, they ask me, &quot;Hey, how do</br>   you do this? What's this?&quot; I can tell them. That's not a problem to me. If</br>   I get my credential today, it's like, &quot;You know what? Yeah. Give me them,</br>   I'll start working like I'm supposed to be.&quot; You go to work to have money.</br>   That work, if it applies some responsibilities, you have to do them,</br>   because otherwise, why would you be working? If you don't want to have</br>   responsibilities, you rather be something else, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about socially? Has it been hard to adjust socially, make</br>   friends, girlfriends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. No. The people I have met, they actually helped me here. They</br>   helped me study and everything, so that wasn't a problem at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss most?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad. I miss my dad. Yeah. I miss him. I remember when we used to</br>   go to field trips, and when he took me to his job, when we went to go watch</br>   movies, to the parks, and stuff like that. It's not like any more, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Neither of you ?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We talk through Messenger, WhatsApp, and through phone, right? I</br>   call him or he calls me, and we keep in touch like that. That's the way we</br>   can talk with each other, but right now since I don't have a phone, it's a</br>   little bit harder. If you don't have a phone, you don't have access to</br>   WhatsApp and Messenger. You have to go to a computer, maybe in your house,</br>   maybe in the local. Sometimes you don't have that time to actually go</br>   there, like having your cell phone right on hand. Having mobile data or</br>   WiFi is very different. You can go on the metro, or go on the metro bus, or</br>   in a bus, in a car, and still be talking with him. In this case, I have to</br>   be in a certain spot to actually talk to him. so yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What are your dreams now, now that you're here?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: The most important one is finish high school. After that, I want to</br>   study software engineer, and I like it a lot. I like it a lot. I want to</br>   get into a good job. Right now, I have a girlfriend. When I needed it, she</br>   was there for me. I have a very good relationship with her, and I feel a</br>   lot of love for her. If things can happen in the future, I'm willing to</br>   take it. I'd take it. I'll take it because not a lot of girls will help you</br>   the way she helped me, because most of them are not interested on who you</br>   are or what you need, and she was in the moment when I needed it.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That's why I feel a lot of love for her. That's a relationship. I</br>   want to go back to the States, even though I know it's harder, getting a</br>   job, but I really want to go with my dad, to be with my dad. Yeah. I want</br>   to be with him, with my brothers. I want to spend more time in my life with</br>   them. The time I didn't have in the past, I want to have it in the future.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: We're going to stop at this point, but is there anything that you</br>   would like to say to people about you and your experiences that you haven't</br>   said yet? Is there anything you want to leave with?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly a lot of immigrants don't have where to go or people to care</br>   them. You know, what I've learned is that there is always a person who can</br>   take care of you. There's always good people that care for you. You know</br>   what? After all the problems, everything, I believe in God, I think God</br>   puts the way, correct way so you can live again, so you will not feel</br>   depressed. You just got to believe. You got to have faith that everything</br>   is going to be all right at the end of the day, and that even if you feel</br>   alone, you're not alone. There's always somebody taking care of you. Even</br>   though if you don't know them, or you haven't seen them, there's always</br>   somebody that takes care of you.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Thank you so much.</br> </div><\p>
