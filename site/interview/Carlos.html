Mostly I left</br>   because my dad lives there and he wanted me to live with him. I went there</br>   because of him. While I went there, I was crossed through the border, but I</br>   really don't remember—I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six years old</span>. I just remember that I was in a</br>   house, then they took me in a car, and then I woke up at another house, and</br>   then at another house until I got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, I think, and that's where</br>   my dad picked me up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you go alone?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah, by myself.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Who did you leave behind?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: I left behind my grandpa, my cousins, my uncles. My mom, mostly,</br>   even though I haven't lived with her, but I left my mom. Some brothers I</br>   have, also. That's what I left behind.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was it hard to leave them behind?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Well, I can remember that part, and it was hard. You're a kid.</br>   You've been living with your grandpa for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six years</span>. You know your dad, but</br>   it's not like you have a big memory of him or a bond with him, right? Yeah.</br>   I remember that when I left, I cried. But, when I got to see my father, I</br>   was joyful. I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah—while we lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oregon</span>. They dropped me basically off at</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. My dad just went in with a car to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, and then we go</br>   back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was he living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> with papers?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, he doesn't have papers. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You came over without... Over the border, you crossed the border.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Exactly. Just like him, but younger.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: He and your mom had split up.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since the beginning, yeah. They never were married or together.</br>   They just had me and that's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Tell me about your time in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was fun. I really enjoyed it. I got to make a lot of friends</br>   there. I still talk to them. I still have more than my dad. I have cousins,</br>   uncles, aunts mostly.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: A lot of family was already there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah, but most of my cousins are already <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizens since they</br>   were born there—you automatically get your papers.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What was your dad doing while you were living there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: He works. He worked in that time as a manager in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Burger King</span>. He</br>   was doing that. Right now he's working, but in another restaurant, equally</br>   has a manager. I think it's Drivers Cruising, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You went to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, and probably you didn't know any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. None.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, it was very hard. In that time, I'm the biggest son of my dad,</br>   and wouldn't have someone to interact with. Mostly it was my cousin. They</br>   lived <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">a few blocks</span> away from us, so I just hanged out with them. Right now</br>   I can remember they were teasing me for not knowing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. It's kind of</br>   fun once you understand, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you start <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, I started <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> grade, because I finished <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade here.</br>   Over there I started <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How'd that go?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Well, I think it would have been worse if I didn't have any other</br>   school friends that were also from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and stuff like that. They had the</br>   same problem. They didn't know how to speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> or so, and we got all</br>   in some courses from school. That's mostly where I ended up learning</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: English as a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> language courses? ESL courses?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yes, I think it was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, yeah. There were other friends who were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. Their fathers are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, and mostly like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you like school? Did you like learning?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a</br>   different way of their system of education. What I liked a lot is that</br>   mostly you get free lunch up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, and you get a lot of courses</br>   that are free, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">summer</span> activities in school, and they're also free.</br>   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked</br>   it a lot. It's different. I remember my school, they had a big park for a</br>   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you play sports?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played</br>   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Track? Track?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,</br>   too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did</br>   you do music?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not</br>   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I</br>   was up into physical education.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see. Cool. Do you make lots of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I remember most of them. I don't know if they remember me,</br>   though.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You said your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> friends really helped you when you were little,</br>   helping you learn the language at all?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you branch out? Did you have friends from all nationalities,</br>   races, or was it mainly did you stick with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> friends?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: I stuck with everybody, like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African-Americans</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizens,</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people. Yeah, with everybody.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you feel different?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I never felt different. You never feel different. In my school,</br>   there was no such thing as discrimination or harassments like that, so I</br>   felt good. I wasn't under pressure of students or discrimination or</br>   something like that. It was very good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you know you were undocumented? Did you know that that would put</br>   barriers, create barriers for what you could do?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that moment since I was little, I didn't know about the</br>   barriers. I knew I didn't have papers, but I didn't know the consequences</br>   of not having papers. You're little. You would like to play and all that</br>   stuff. Basically, you're a kid, and kids just enjoy life.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: When did you figure it out?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Mostly when I came here, because in that moment I wasn't really</br>   informed about anything. When I got deported back, I didn't even know about</br>   such things. I thought it would be normal. I didn't even think of having a</br>   job or a social security number, or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How old are you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">20</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How old were you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">15</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: It's a long story. I had some friends—they were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African Americans</span>,</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, also some from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. I hanged out with them for a long</br>   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad</br>   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a</br>   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Corvette</span>. An old one,</br>   though. Not like the one they have here, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,</br>   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just</br>   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go</br>   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Walgreens</span> pharmacy. Everything went</br>   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they</br>   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There</br>   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think</br>   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them</br>   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't</br>   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so</br>   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Just a child.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The</br>   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, &quot;Hey, you know what? After they</br>   snitch&quot;—and he knew—he was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're about to get</br>   in trouble. We're in a gang.&quot; I really don't remember the name of the gang.</br>   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,</br>   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I didn't see any. I was just like blind. When I got there, I was</br>   blind. I didn't see nothing bad. That's why I didn't suspect anything at</br>   the moment until this guy told me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Had you been in trouble before?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, but not big, big trouble. Since I'm really playful and</br>   anxious, so I need to do something to keep myself calm. In that moment, we</br>   had BB guns, and I didn't know that was bad bringing them to school. I was</br>   getting suspended for that. Also one time, one of our friends took the</br>   little skateboards. I don't remember what the name was, but you can handle</br>   it with your fingers.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How big? How big are they?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: They're tiny, like this big.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We took all his skateboards from his backpack when we were in</br>   recess. What happened...I didn't know, I thought we’re just going to play</br>   with them. At the end, they told him. His name was <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lucious</span>. They told him,</br>   &quot;Hey.&quot; They put me out, like if I were the one who was stealing this stuff.</br>   That was like, &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lucious</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span> stole your stuff,&quot; and he got mad. He even</br>   hit me, but it's like I didn't even... It's like, &quot;Bro.&quot; It's like, &quot;Why</br>   are you doing this?&quot; Then they explained it to me</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since my grandma—I mostly lived with my grandma back in the</br>   States—didn't know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, every time I was in trouble, my grandma had to</br>   go for me to school and stuff like that. They had one of our friends</br>   translate to her what the teacher or principal was saying.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Your dad wasn't around?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He wasn't that around because he was working. He mostly works all</br>   day, probably.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It was you and your grandma and him in your house?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, basically. Not really that much in the house, because when I</br>   got there, my dad was hooked up with a girl. I think she was here from</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, too, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span>, I think. They were together, but that woman, she had a</br>   kid. His name was <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Eduardo</span>, but he was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen. He's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span> older</br>   than me. We got into fights a lot, and she got tired of me. She even kicked</br>   us out. For <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a few months</span>, it was me and my dad only before my grandma went</br>   to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. After that, after my grandma got there, I was just living</br>   with my grandma most of the time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: My dad visited me. And when he got kids, I used to take care of</br>   them when I was in school or my grandma was working, because she also</br>   worked. She was a housekeeper. She had different jobs. Mostly that's what</br>   we were living out of, from the money of my dad and the money that my</br>   grandma was taking out of the housekeeping.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Your home life was a little lonely?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the time I was lonely, yeah. Even though in that time, I</br>   enjoyed being lonely because I could go out, go to the park with my</br>   friends.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Hang out with your friends.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: In school, I wasn't bad. I was a good student, but there was one</br>   problem: I was too anxious, so I was always talking, or I was doing</br>   something that got me in trouble.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay. You get caught in this robbery that you're unaware of. Then</br>   what? You're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15 years old</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Exactly. I didn't know what happened, but I was with a judge. I was</br>   little. I really don't remember a lot of stuff. What I do remember is that</br>   they were aware I was a child. I don't think my lawyer spoke with</br>   somebody—I really don't know all the process.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you father come to help?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah, he did. We were afraid that he was also going to get deported</br>   of the same situation. Since my grandmother was working for a lot of</br>   houses, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She was undocumented, too?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, my grandma. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> of the friends of my grandma, she worked in</br>   her house, she volunteered also to go help me. Basically they ran off with</br>   my dad and lawyer, and the friend, her name was <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Leanne</span>. I still remember</br>   her. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Leanne</span>. I really don't know the process. I was in the correctional—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: In a juvenile correctional facility?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you with kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. I was somewhere in ____.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oregon</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah, in ___ <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oregon</span>. What basically they told me after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the 10 days</span>,</br>   &quot;All right, you need to come back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot; I needed to come back, so</br>   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with</br>   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br>   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately</br>   because she has been taking care of me for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">almost 19 years</span>. Almost <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">20</span>.</br>   Yeah, almost all my life.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: When you were sent back, do you know if it was long-term departure or</br>   a deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I just know it was deported. I didn't—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you have a limit as to when you can apply for a visa to go back to</br>   the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I found out here it is was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Ten years</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: What I heard from a friend is that it also takes <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">another ten years</span>,</br>   so it's basically <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">20</span>. I really don't know what the difference is. They told</br>   me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: If it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten years</span>, then you can start the process after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten years</span>. I</br>   don't know how long the process takes. It's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five</span>, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Maybe in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five years</span>, it won't take as long as it does now. It's</br>   curious because you're a minor.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I also talked about, with some friends</br>   here, when we all talk about our lives. They were like, &quot;Why did you get</br>   deported? You were so young.&quot; Stuff like that. It's like, &quot;Bro, I don't</br>   know. I was young. I didn't know anything until they told me everything.&quot;</br>   You don't realize about things until you're older, and so you know really</br>   what happens, and what are the laws.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You weren't even young enough to know that you couldn't get a</br>   driver's license, or maybe you could in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Oregon</span>. I think you can, but you</br>   weren't old enough to know what you couldn't do as an undocumented kid.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Because you hadn't experienced that. I don't know the laws, but I</br>   imagine that since your family members were undocumented—</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, that's why I think my family didn't put a lot of pressure</br>   into that, because they were also undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: They would have been deported, as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: If my dad goes, my brothers will be alone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you have a record? Given that crime, were you convicted of that</br>   crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think not. I'm not sure. I have to ask my dad. He knows all about</br>   it, but we never talk about that stuff. We always talk about, &quot;How are you?</br>   What you've been doing?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was there a trial?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: There was a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was there a trial for the crime?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think it was, but I really don't remember</br>   that as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Because you weren't...</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I don't remember a lot of stuff, mostly because what hit me was</br>   being separated from your dad. I can tell you that with my mom and my dad,</br>   I have lived <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">all my 20 years</span>. I got to see my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> brothers little. Right</br>   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I</br>   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my</br>   dad and my brothers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with</br>   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at</br>   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of</br>   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're</br>   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can</br>   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Saturdays</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Sundays</span> off.</br>   I'm barely at their house, but I really appreciate it, that they took care</br>   of me.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the times, I think about what would be different from</br>   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.</br>   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you</br>   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not</br>   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a</br>   teenager. Right now that I’m <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">20</span>. I haven't been with my dad so he can't</br>   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would</br>   like, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you</br>   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most</br>   important thing is being with your actual family than all the economic</br>   stuff or the money. Most important thing is the love and the relationship</br>   you have with them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You're a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15 year old</span> kid and you're being deported. Where do they</br>   take you? What do they do with you, the ICE [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Immigration and Customs   Enforcement</span>]?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten days</span> in the States before they deported me. After that, I</br>   just remember I went to the border, and my family picked me up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: They called your family to have them come pick you up?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly my dad. They came to pick me up, and then we just took a</br>   flight over to Mexico City. That's it. Being here wasn't really easy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Your family had been from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: They met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And then they brought you back. Hopefully the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> agents were taking</br>   care of you until you got to them. You were a minor. They must have had the</br>   responsibility to make sure that you got into proper hands. This is</br>   dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Mostly on the border, there's a lot of drug dealers and</br>   cartels and stuff like that, now that I know of. In the moment, I really</br>   didn't know about anything. I didn't really care about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> anymore. I</br>   was hoping I would stay there for a long time, grow up, get a job,</br>   probably. Finish college. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Your dreams in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> were to do what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: To study and get a job, and to live there, getting a partner, to</br>   get married, and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Who met you? Which family met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was the family from my father. My grandpa that I lived with, and</br>   some aunts.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you know them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yes. Yeah, because in here when I was little, I used to the with</br>   them a lot of time. Even here before I went to the States, I was mischief.</br>   To be honest, my situation in school has always been problems, problems,</br>   problems because here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> I used to get into the ceilings of the</br>   schools, and throwing pencils, and hitting people, and all this stuff. That</br>   was when I was here. I usually went to a school that was most for kids that</br>   are misbehaving.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Even when you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. When I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six</span>. I got expelled from a school here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: In kindergarten or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span> grade. It all happened in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think that's why your dad brought you to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. He mostly wanted me back because he wanted to be with me,</br>   right? I don't know a father, or maybe there are some cases, but I don't</br>   know of a father that wouldn't like to be with their children.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You never got expelled from a school in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, never. Yeah. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You did good.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Great. You came back, resumed living where you had lived in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   six years of your life?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah, in the same house.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Tell me how you felt.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was hard because I felt sad at the moment not being with my dad</br>   and my brothers. Another part, I felt kind good because I had my uncles and</br>   my grandpas. One of my uncles that lived here is one of the ones that I</br>   loved the most, apart from my dad. That was kinda a relief. You put</br>   something bad and put another good thing on top of that, it just kind of</br>   mixes, and at the end, I'm here. That's what I think, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How far have you gotten in school? You were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>, so?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">seventh</span> grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">Seventh</span>?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">Seventh</span>. Up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">seventh</span> grade, something like that. When</br>   I got here, I finished middle school. I don't know what grade. It was</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">eighth</span> grade, I think? Something like that. Here, they handle it different,</br>   because you have elementary school, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six years</span>, then middle school, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three   years</span>, and after that, high school that is also <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>, and off to</br>   college.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was it hard getting back into the school system here?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, very hard. Very, very hard. Mostly because I was so into</br>   English and the subjects—well, I don't think they differ a lot, but</br>   obviously history isn't the same. Most of the things aren't the same.</br>   Civics aren't also the same. They have different ones here or there.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, they have here <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, that's a subject. I was like, &quot;What are</br>   these?&quot; They have little, I don't know, like this. This thing right here.</br>   [pointing to accents]</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was like, &quot;Where do you put that? Why do you put that?&quot; Yeah, it</br>   was very hard for me because, for instance, I didn't talk a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>.</br>   I didn't know a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Have you learned to read <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You had to?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah. Yeah, because even right now, I don't like to read in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. I prefer <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. If somebody gets me a book, &quot;You know what? Can</br>   you get me a book, but it’s <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?&quot; Because I don't like reading in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> a lot, mostly because of the practice, you know? I want to keep my</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> a little bit more fluid. Right now having a little bit of troubles</br>   pronouncing words and stuff like that, because it’s not the same. You speak</br>   it every day and write it every day up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Over here, you speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. Here, the system of education for</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> is very bad. It's very bad. I always try to hear music in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>,</br>   and read books, and stuff like that, and watch movies in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> because if</br>   you don't practice it, you'll forget it. You'll forget it. Once you're</br>   older, it is very difficult or is more difficult to learn a language than</br>   when you were little. Getting back here was [Pow sound].</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They even thought it would be better if I started middle school,</br>   but from the beginning, not onto the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> grade that I was supposed to be.</br>   No, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade because I didn't know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, and most of the subjects</br>   that are needed for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. I was great in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. They took my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span></br>   classes away so I can retake <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, but on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> level. They were</br>   testing me if to keep me on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> grade, or going back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade. I</br>   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I</br>   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,</br>   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,</br>   school was like, I care about it, but not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">100%</span>. Since I like soccer, I used</br>   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.</br>   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like</br>   that. They even paid me classes for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and for another subject into</br>   Spanish, so I didn't really have a hard time. I spent <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> in those</br>   classes. After that, I'm normal. I can talk Spanish normally and all that</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How far have you gotten in high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Let's say I finished. I already went past through the last grade,</br>   that is the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> grade here, but I still haven't passed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">six</span> subjects. So,</br>   I don't have my certificates. I haven't finished high school still.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Will you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I will, and I want to.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Does it mean taking tests, or does it mean actually taking courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Taking the test of the subjects that you haven't passed, and most</br>   of them are very difficult. I studied in my school. It's from the, I don't</br>   know if you heard of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Instituto Politécnico Nacional</span>.</br> </br> </br>   .</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah. It's the high schools from that institute. All of them have</br>   specialties. They got construction, they got electricity. There's, how can</br>   I say it? There's also for the planes, and how to fix them for mechanics,</br>   cars. There's another one, but I really don't know. It's industrial</br>   processes or something like that? That would be the translation of what I</br>   know of.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I got electricity, but the subjects that I failed on are the</br>   hardest ones. To be true, I have been trying to finish it for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five years</span>.</br>   From the point I got into school, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> grade, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span></br>   grade, I have taken <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five years</span> and counting. I really want to finish high</br>   school, because it helps speaking <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, mostly because they don't have a</br>   lot of jobs that are well paid here. Having to know or getting to speak</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> is a bonus. Right now, I'm in a job that, they don't pay you that</br>   bad if you're single, you don't have kids, it's okay, but once you have a</br>   family? No. It's not a lot of money for having a family. It's just for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span></br>   person.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What is that job?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: It's a call center right here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Teletech</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yeah, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Teletech</span>, right there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long you been working there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Right now, I have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two months</span>, but I've been working into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Vista</span>,</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">CompuCom</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">CCSI</span>, it's one right there on that street.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Why do you keep changing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: On the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> one, my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> job was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2017</span>, I was still studying. In</br>   that time, I didn't have my subjects, not a pass or anything. I was good. I</br>   always studied in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">the afternoon</span>. It was from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">2:00 to 10:00</span>. I worked from</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">8:00</span> to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">3:00</span>. I was half-time, but I really couldn't, it was a lot of</br>   pressure, and I was like, &quot;You know what? I'm going to quit. It's okay. I</br>   may want money, but I think it's not the time.&quot; Then after that, I worked</br>   at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">CompuCom</span>. That's more technical service related. It's not like you're</br>   assisting customers.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: You're assisting the users of a company, the people who work there,</br>   not the customers. I like that a lot. It's more technical support. It's</br>   better than customer service. Customer service, you get a lot of angry</br>   customers, and they yell at you, and all that stuff [Anne laughs]. That's</br>   where I worked. I worked there <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span>—that was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year after</span>. In that</br>   time, I already finished, partially finished, school. I was there to make</br>   money, because I decided that it was time for me to work, and I started</br>   making money.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that point, I had some problems with my grandma and my grandpa,</br>   so I left the house. I met there in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">CompuCom</span> before that a guy, and we were</br>   best friends. We were always together. He was like, &quot;Hey, if anything</br>   happens, you can go to my house, to my crib,&quot; and all that stuff. Like,</br>   &quot;Okay, bet.&quot; We even took our stuff, my stuff from my house all the way to</br>   his house. It's a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">two-hour</span> trip.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's [foreign – location/Insurgentes <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:40:26</span>], basically. I was</br>   good with him, but in that moment, something happened: I started drinking</br>   and stuff, so I really much care less for my job, started going down, and</br>   stuff like that. I got fired eventually.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Kind of, because the problems that I also had with my family took</br>   over the situation. With him, I bought a lot of stuff. I bought shoes,</br>   shirts, and all that stuff. I was living with him until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">August</span>. That's when</br>   my mom contacted me. She lives right now in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Queretaro</span>. I was just going to</br>   visit her for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two or three weeks</span>, but I stayed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two months</span>. I stayed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two   months</span> with her and with my brothers—half-brothers, if I can say that.</br>   After I came back with this guy again, something happened.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When we were together, he didn't hang out with people like robbers</br>   and stuff like that, but when I was back, you can see all the people right</br>   there. Changing things from the cars, and stealing them, stuff like that.</br>   Yeah. I don't know what happened in his head in that moment, but he threw</br>   me from his house basically with nothing. I didn't have anything left. From</br>   that, I was living on different towns, if you can say. Towns? Until I got</br>   back with my grandparents. We arrange things again, and we got into an</br>   agreement.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: I have been living with them since that. That's mostly what—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are you staying out of trouble?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Yes, totally. No more trouble. After that incident, I worked here</br>   at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">CCSI</span>, but I didn't like it because the supervisors didn't have any… How</br>   can I say it? They didn't have a good organization. They set your breaks</br>   and lunch in certain times. For example, I entered at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">2:00</span>. I had my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   break for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">15 minutes</span> from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">3:00 to 3:15</span>. Then I had my lunch from—it was</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">half an hour</span> by the way—from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">4:00</span> for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">4:30</span>. I had my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> break until</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">9:00 to 9:15</span>, and I didn't like that.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When you had your days off, there wasn't a way that they could tell</br>   you. When you got into the floor, it was like, &quot;Why do you come? You got</br>   your day <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">today</span>. You're not supposed to come.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why don't you</br>   tell us before?&quot; A day before?” I didn't like that. The payment was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">weekly</span>.</br>   It was not that bad, but I didn't like it. That's when I applied here at</br>   TeleTech. I like it so far. It's good, and the best thing is that I don't</br>   have credentials, so I'm not working.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What does that mean?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Basically in call centers, you have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">60</span> people, and your max</br>   is for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">70</span>. A new wave comes in, maybe <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">15</span> people, and the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span> people that</br>   are left—since you already took all of the capacity you're supposed to have</br>   for agents and the rest of them don't have credentials—don't do anything.</br>   You don't work. Let's say you don't work. You just wake up to come to work</br>   and not do anything. That's what not having credentials means.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You're getting paid for nothing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: Exactly. I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll take it.&quot; Even so, in training, I</br>   consider myself as one of the best of all my wave, because I have the</br>   knowledge, and even though I don't do nothing, they ask me, &quot;Hey, how do</br>   you do this? What's this?&quot; I can tell them. That's not a problem to me. If</br>   I get my credential <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">today</span>, it's like, &quot;You know what? Yeah. Give me them,</br>   I'll start working like I'm supposed to be.&quot; You go to work to have money.</br>   That work, if it applies some responsibilities, you have to do them,</br>   because otherwise, why would you be working? If you don't want to have</br>   responsibilities, you rather be something else, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What about socially? Has it been hard to adjust socially, make</br>   friends, girlfriends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. No. The people I have met, they actually helped me here. They</br>   helped me study and everything, so that wasn't a problem at all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What do you miss most?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Carlos</span>: My dad. I miss my dad. Yeah. I miss him. I remember when we used to</br>   go to field trips, and when he took me to his job, when we went to go watch</br>   movies, to the parks, and stuff like that. It's not like any more, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Neither of you ?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We talk through Messenger, WhatsApp, and through phone, right? I</br>   call him or he calls me, and we keep in touch like that. That's the way we</br>   can talk with each other, but right now since I don't have a phone, it's a</br>   little bit harder. If you don't have a phone, you don't have access to</br>   WhatsApp and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Messenger</span>. You have to go to a computer, maybe in your house,</br>   maybe in the local. Sometimes you don't have that time to actually go</br>   there, like having your cell phone right on hand. Having mobile data or</br>   WiFi is very different. You can go on the metro, or go on the metro bus, or</br>   in a bus, in a car, and still be talking with him. In this case, I have to</br>   be in a certain spot to actually talk to him. so yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What are your dreams now, now that you're here?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: The most important one is finish high school. After that, I want to</br>   study software engineer, and I like it a lot. I like it a lot. I want to</br>   get into a good job. Right now, I have a girlfriend. When I needed it, she</br>   was there for me. I have a very good relationship with her, and I feel a</br>   lot of love for her. If things can happen in the future, I'm willing to</br>   take it. I'd take it. I'll take it because not a lot of girls will help you</br>   the way she helped me, because most of them are not interested on who you</br>   are or what you need, and she was in the moment when I needed it.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That's why I feel a lot of love for her. That's a relationship. I</br>   want to go back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Migration from Mexico, Border crossing, Border crossing, Age">When I left here in Mexico, I was six years old. Mostly I left   because my dad lives there and he wanted me to live with him. I went there   because of him. While I went there, I was crossed through the border, but I   really don't remember—I was six years old. I just remember that I was in a   house, then they took me in a car, and then I woke up at another house, and   then at another house until I got to California, I think, and that's where   my dad picked me up.    </span> Anne: Did you go alone?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, by myself.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who did you leave behind?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I left behind my grandpa, my cousins, my uncles. My mom, mostly,</br>   even though I haven't lived with her, but I left my mom. Some brothers I</br>   have, also. That's what I left behind.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard to leave them behind?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Well, I can remember that part, and it was hard. You're a kid.</br>   You've been living with your grandpa for six years. You know your dad, but</br>   it's not like you have a big memory of him or a bond with him, right? Yeah.</br>   I remember that when I left, I cried. But, when I got to see my father, I</br>   was joyful. I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You went to California?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah—while we lived in Oregon. They dropped me basically off at</br>   California. My dad just went in with a car to California, and then we go</br>   back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was he living in the US with papers?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, he doesn't have papers. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You came over without... Over the border, you crossed the border.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. Just like him, but younger.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He and your mom had split up.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since the beginning, yeah. They never were married or together.</br>   They just had me and that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me about your time in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was fun. I really enjoyed it. I got to make a lot of friends</br>   there. I still talk to them. I still have more than my dad. I have cousins,</br>   uncles, aunts mostly.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A lot of family was already there.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, but most of my cousins are already US citizens since they</br>   were born there—you automatically get your papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was your dad doing while you were living there?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He works. He worked in that time as a manager in Burger King. He</br>   was doing that. Right now he's working, but in another restaurant, equally</br>   has a manager. I think it's Drivers Cruising, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You went to the US, and probably you didn't know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. None.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, it was very hard. In that time, I'm the biggest son of my dad,</br>   and wouldn't have someone to interact with. Mostly it was my cousin. They</br>   lived a few blocks away from us, so I just hanged out with them. Right now</br>   I can remember they were teasing me for not knowing English. It's kind of</br>   fun once you understand, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you start first grade in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, I started second grade, because I finished first grade here.</br>   Over there I started second grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How'd that go?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Well, I think it would have been worse if I didn't have any other</br>   school friends that were also from Mexico and stuff like that. They had the</br>   same problem. They didn't know how to speak English or so, and we got all</br>   in some courses from school. That's mostly where I ended up learning</br>   English. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: English as a second language courses? ESL courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, I think it was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. There were other friends who were Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. Their fathers are Mexicans, and mostly like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you like school? Did you like learning?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a</br>   different way of their system of education. What I liked a lot is that</br>   mostly you get free lunch up in the States, and you get a lot of courses</br>   that are free, and summer activities in school, and they're also free.</br>   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked</br>   it a lot. It's different. I remember my school, they had a big park for a</br>   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you play sports?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played</br>   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Track? Track?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,</br>   too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did</br>   you do music?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not</br>   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I</br>   was up into physical education.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. Cool. Do you make lots of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I remember most of them. I don't know if they remember me,</br>   though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said your Mexican friends really helped you when you were little,</br>   helping you learn the language at all?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you branch out? Did you have friends from all nationalities,</br>   races, or was it mainly did you stick with Mexican friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I stuck with everybody, like African-Americans, US citizens,</br>   Mexican people. Yeah, with everybody.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you feel different?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I never felt different. You never feel different. In my school,</br>   there was no such thing as discrimination or harassments like that, so I</br>   felt good. I wasn't under pressure of students or discrimination or</br>   something like that. It was very good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know you were undocumented? Did you know that that would put</br>   barriers, create barriers for what you could do?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that moment since I was little, I didn't know about the</br>   barriers. I knew I didn't have papers, but I didn't know the consequences</br>   of not having papers. You're little. You would like to play and all that</br>   stuff. Basically, you're a kid, and kids just enjoy life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When did you figure it out?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly when I came here, because in that moment I wasn't really</br>   informed about anything. When I got deported back, I didn't even know about</br>   such things. I thought it would be normal. I didn't even think of having a</br>   job or a social security number, or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I'm 20.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a long story. I had some friends—they were African Americans,</br>   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long</br>   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad</br>   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a</br>   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,</br>   though. Not like the one they have here, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,</br>   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just</br>   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go</br>   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went</br>   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they</br>   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There</br>   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think</br>   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them</br>   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't</br>   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so</br>   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were 15?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Just a child.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The</br>   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, &quot;Hey, you know what? After they</br>   snitch&quot;—and he knew—he was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're about to get</br>   in trouble. We're in a gang.&quot; I really don't remember the name of the gang.</br>   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,</br>   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I didn't see any. I was just like blind. When I got there, I was</br>   blind. I didn't see nothing bad. That's why I didn't suspect anything at</br>   the moment until this guy told me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been in trouble before?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, but not big, big trouble. Since I'm really playful and</br>   anxious, so I need to do something to keep myself calm. In that moment, we</br>   had BB guns, and I didn't know that was bad bringing them to school. I was</br>   getting suspended for that. Also one time, one of our friends took the</br>   little skateboards. I don't remember what the name was, but you can handle</br>   it with your fingers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How big? How big are they?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They're tiny, like this big.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We took all his skateboards from his backpack when we were in</br>   recess. What happened...I didn't know, I thought we’re just going to play</br>   with them. At the end, they told him. His name was Lucious. They told him,</br>   &quot;Hey.&quot; They put me out, like if I were the one who was stealing this stuff.</br>   That was like, &quot;Lucious, Carlos stole your stuff,&quot; and he got mad. He even</br>   hit me, but it's like I didn't even... It's like, &quot;Bro.&quot; It's like, &quot;Why</br>   are you doing this?&quot; Then they explained it to me</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since my grandma—I mostly lived with my grandma back in the</br>   States—didn't know English, every time I was in trouble, my grandma had to</br>   go for me to school and stuff like that. They had one of our friends</br>   translate to her what the teacher or principal was saying.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dad wasn't around?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He wasn't that around because he was working. He mostly works all</br>   day, probably.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It was you and your grandma and him in your house?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, basically. Not really that much in the house, because when I</br>   got there, my dad was hooked up with a girl. I think she was here from</br>   Mexico, too, Puebla, I think. They were together, but that woman, she had a</br>   kid. His name was Eduardo, but he was a US citizen. He's three years older</br>   than me. We got into fights a lot, and she got tired of me. She even kicked</br>   us out. For a few months, it was me and my dad only before my grandma went</br>   to the States. After that, after my grandma got there, I was just living</br>   with my grandma most of the time.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad visited me. And when he got kids, I used to take care of</br>   them when I was in school or my grandma was working, because she also</br>   worked. She was a housekeeper. She had different jobs. Mostly that's what</br>   we were living out of, from the money of my dad and the money that my</br>   grandma was taking out of the housekeeping.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your home life was a little lonely?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the time I was lonely, yeah. Even though in that time, I</br>   enjoyed being lonely because I could go out, go to the park with my</br>   friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hang out with your friends.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, I wasn't bad. I was a good student, but there was one</br>   problem: I was too anxious, so I was always talking, or I was doing</br>   something that got me in trouble.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. You get caught in this robbery that you're unaware of. Then</br>   what? You're 15 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I didn't know what happened, but I was with a judge. I was</br>   little. I really don't remember a lot of stuff. What I do remember is that</br>   they were aware I was a child. I don't think my lawyer spoke with</br>   somebody—I really don't know all the process.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you father come to help?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, he did. We were afraid that he was also going to get deported</br>   of the same situation. Since my grandmother was working for a lot of</br>   houses, one of the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She was undocumented, too?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, my grandma. One of the friends of my grandma, she worked in</br>   her house, she volunteered also to go help me. Basically they ran off with</br>   my dad and lawyer, and the friend, her name was Leanne. I still remember</br>   her. Leanne. I really don't know the process. I was in the correctional—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In a juvenile correctional facility?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you with kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. I was somewhere in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Oregon?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, in ___ Oregon. What basically they told me after the 10 days,</br>   &quot;All right, you need to come back to Mexico.&quot; I needed to come back, so</br>   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with</br>   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to Mexico.</br>   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately</br>   because she has been taking care of me for almost 19 years. Almost 20.</br>   Yeah, almost all my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were sent back, do you know if it was long-term departure or</br>   a deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I just know it was deported. I didn't—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a limit as to when you can apply for a visa to go back to</br>   the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I found out here it is was ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Ten years?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I heard from a friend is that it also takes another ten years,</br>   so it's basically 20. I really don't know what the difference is. They told</br>   me ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: If it's ten years, then you can start the process after ten years. I</br>   don't know how long the process takes. It's been five, right?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Maybe in five years, it won't take as long as it does now. It's</br>   curious because you're a minor.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I also talked about, with some friends</br>   here, when we all talk about our lives. They were like, &quot;Why did you get</br>   deported? You were so young.&quot; Stuff like that. It's like, &quot;Bro, I don't</br>   know. I was young. I didn't know anything until they told me everything.&quot;</br>   You don't realize about things until you're older, and so you know really</br>   what happens, and what are the laws.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You weren't even young enough to know that you couldn't get a</br>   driver's license, or maybe you could in Oregon. I think you can, but you</br>   weren't old enough to know what you couldn't do as an undocumented kid.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you hadn't experienced that. I don't know the laws, but I</br>   imagine that since your family members were undocumented—</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, that's why I think my family didn't put a lot of pressure</br>   into that, because they were also undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They would have been deported, as well.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: If my dad goes, my brothers will be alone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a record? Given that crime, were you convicted of that</br>   crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think not. I'm not sure. I have to ask my dad. He knows all about</br>   it, but we never talk about that stuff. We always talk about, &quot;How are you?</br>   What you've been doing?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: There was a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there a trial for the crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think it was, but I really don't remember</br>   that as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you weren't...</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I don't remember a lot of stuff, mostly because what hit me was</br>   being separated from your dad. I can tell you that with my mom and my dad,</br>   I have lived all my 20 years. I got to see my two brothers little. Right</br>   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I</br>   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my</br>   dad and my brothers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with</br>   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at</br>   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of</br>   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're</br>   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can</br>   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get Saturdays and Sundays off.</br>   I'm barely at their house, but I really appreciate it, that they took care</br>   of me.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the times, I think about what would be different from</br>   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.</br>   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you</br>   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not</br>   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a</br>   teenager. Right now that I’m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't</br>   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would</br>   like, right?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you</br>   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most</br>   important thing is being with your actual family than all the economic</br>   stuff or the money. Most important thing is the love and the relationship</br>   you have with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're a 15 year old kid and you're being deported. Where do they</br>   take you? What do they do with you, the ICE [Immigration and Customs</br>   Enforcement]?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was ten days in the States before they deported me. After that, I</br>   just remember I went to the border, and my family picked me up.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They called your family to have them come pick you up?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly my dad. They came to pick me up, and then we just took a</br>   flight over to Mexico City. That's it. Being here wasn't really easy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your family had been from Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then they brought you back. Hopefully the ICE agents were taking</br>   care of you until you got to them. You were a minor. They must have had the</br>   responsibility to make sure that you got into proper hands. This is</br>   dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Mostly on the border, there's a lot of drug dealers and</br>   cartels and stuff like that, now that I know of. In the moment, I really</br>   didn't know about anything. I didn't really care about Mexico anymore. I</br>   was hoping I would stay there for a long time, grow up, get a job,</br>   probably. Finish college. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dreams in the US were to do what?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: To study and get a job, and to live there, getting a partner, to</br>   get married, and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who met you? Which family met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was the family from my father. My grandpa that I lived with, and</br>   some aunts.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know them?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. Yeah, because in here when I was little, I used to the with</br>   them a lot of time. Even here before I went to the States, I was mischief.</br>   To be honest, my situation in school has always been problems, problems,</br>   problems because here in Mexico I used to get into the ceilings of the</br>   schools, and throwing pencils, and hitting people, and all this stuff. That</br>   was when I was here. I usually went to a school that was most for kids that</br>   are misbehaving.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Even when you were six?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. When I was six. I got expelled from a school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In kindergarten or first grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: First grade. It all happened in first grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think that's why your dad brought you to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. He mostly wanted me back because he wanted to be with me,</br>   right? I don't know a father, or maybe there are some cases, but I don't</br>   know of a father that wouldn't like to be with their children.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You never got expelled from a school in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, never. Yeah. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did good.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Great. You came back, resumed living where you had lived in the first</br>   six years of your life?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, in the same house.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me how you felt.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was hard because I felt sad at the moment not being with my dad</br>   and my brothers. Another part, I felt kind good because I had my uncles and</br>   my grandpas. One of my uncles that lived here is one of the ones that I</br>   loved the most, apart from my dad. That was kinda a relief. You put</br>   something bad and put another good thing on top of that, it just kind of</br>   mixes, and at the end, I'm here. That's what I think, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far have you gotten in school? You were 15, so?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think it was seventh grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Seventh?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Seventh. Up in the States, seventh grade, something like that. When</br>   I got here, I finished middle school. I don't know what grade. It was</br>   eighth grade, I think? Something like that. Here, they handle it different,</br>   because you have elementary school, six years, then middle school, three</br>   years, and after that, high school that is also three years, and off to</br>   college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard getting back into the school system here?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, very hard. Very, very hard. Mostly because I was so into</br>   English and the subjects—well, I don't think they differ a lot, but</br>   obviously history isn't the same. Most of the things aren't the same.</br>   Civics aren't also the same. They have different ones here or there.</br>   Spanish, they have here Spanish, that's a subject. I was like, &quot;What are</br>   these?&quot; They have little, I don't know, like this. This thing right here.</br>   [pointing to accents]</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was like, &quot;Where do you put that? Why do you put that?&quot; Yeah, it</br>   was very hard for me because, for instance, I didn't talk a lot of Spanish.</br>   I didn't know a lot of Spanish.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you learned to read Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had to?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, because even right now, I don't like to read in</br>   Spanish. I prefer English. If somebody gets me a book, &quot;You know what? Can</br>   you get me a book, but it’s English?&quot; Because I don't like reading in</br>   Spanish a lot, mostly because of the practice, you know? I want to keep my</br>   English a little bit more fluid. Right now having a little bit of troubles</br>   pronouncing words and stuff like that, because it’s not the same. You speak</br>   it every day and write it every day up in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Over here, you speak Spanish. Here, the system of education for</br>   English is very bad. It's very bad. I always try to hear music in English,</br>   and read books, and stuff like that, and watch movies in English because if</br>   you don't practice it, you'll forget it. You'll forget it. Once you're</br>   older, it is very difficult or is more difficult to learn a language than</br>   when you were little. Getting back here was [Pow sound].</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They even thought it would be better if I started middle school,</br>   but from the beginning, not onto the third grade that I was supposed to be.</br>   No, in first grade because I didn't know Spanish, and most of the subjects</br>   that are needed for Spanish. I was great in English. They took my English</br>   classes away so I can retake Spanish, but on second level. They were</br>   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I</br>   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I</br>   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,</br>   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,</br>   school was like, I care about it, but not 100%. Since I like soccer, I used</br>   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.</br>   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like</br>   that. They even paid me classes for Spanish and for another subject into</br>   Spanish, so I didn't really have a hard time. I spent two years in those</br>   classes. After that, I'm normal. I can talk Spanish normally and all that</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far have you gotten in high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Let's say I finished. I already went past through the last grade,</br>   that is the third grade here, but I still haven't passed six subjects. So,</br>   I don't have my certificates. I haven't finished high school still.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Will you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I will, and I want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does it mean taking tests, or does it mean actually taking courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Taking the test of the subjects that you haven't passed, and most</br>   of them are very difficult. I studied in my school. It's from the, I don't</br>   know if you heard of Instituto Politécnico Nacional.</br> </br> </br>   .</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It's the high schools from that institute. All of them have</br>   specialties. They got construction, they got electricity. There's, how can</br>   I say it? There's also for the planes, and how to fix them for mechanics,</br>   cars. There's another one, but I really don't know. It's industrial</br>   processes or something like that? That would be the translation of what I</br>   know of.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I got electricity, but the subjects that I failed on are the</br>   hardest ones. To be true, I have been trying to finish it for five years.</br>   From the point I got into school, first grade, second grade, and third</br>   grade, I have taken five years and counting. I really want to finish high</br>   school, because it helps speaking English, mostly because they don't have a</br>   lot of jobs that are well paid here. Having to know or getting to speak</br>   English is a bonus. Right now, I'm in a job that, they don't pay you that</br>   bad if you're single, you don't have kids, it's okay, but once you have a</br>   family? No. It's not a lot of money for having a family. It's just for one</br>   person.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is that job?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a call center right here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Teletech?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, Teletech, right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long you been working there?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I have two months, but I've been working into Vista,</br>   CompuCom, CCSI, it's one right there on that street.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why do you keep changing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: On the first one, my first job was 2017, I was still studying. In</br>   that time, I didn't have my subjects, not a pass or anything. I was good. I</br>   always studied in the afternoon. It was from 2:00 to 10:00. I worked from</br>   8:00 to 3:00. I was half-time, but I really couldn't, it was a lot of</br>   pressure, and I was like, &quot;You know what? I'm going to quit. It's okay. I</br>   may want money, but I think it's not the time.&quot; Then after that, I worked</br>   at CompuCom. That's more technical service related. It's not like you're</br>   assisting customers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: You're assisting the users of a company, the people who work there,</br>   not the customers. I like that a lot. It's more technical support. It's</br>   better than customer service. Customer service, you get a lot of angry</br>   customers, and they yell at you, and all that stuff [Anne laughs]. That's</br>   where I worked. I worked there six months—that was one year after. In that</br>   time, I already finished, partially finished, school. I was there to make</br>   money, because I decided that it was time for me to work, and I started</br>   making money.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that point, I had some problems with my grandma and my grandpa,</br>   so I left the house. I met there in CompuCom before that a guy, and we were</br>   best friends. We were always together. He was like, &quot;Hey, if anything</br>   happens, you can go to my house, to my crib,&quot; and all that stuff. Like,</br>   &quot;Okay, bet.&quot; We even took our stuff, my stuff from my house all the way to</br>   his house. It's a two-hour trip.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's [foreign – location/Insurgentes 00:40:26], basically. I was</br>   good with him, but in that moment, something happened: I started drinking</br>   and stuff, so I really much care less for my job, started going down, and</br>   stuff like that. I got fired eventually.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Kind of, because the problems that I also had with my family took</br>   over the situation. With him, I bought a lot of stuff. I bought shoes,</br>   shirts, and all that stuff. I was living with him until August. That's when</br>   my mom contacted me. She lives right now in Queretaro. I was just going to</br>   visit her for two or three weeks, but I stayed two months. I stayed two</br>   months with her and with my brothers—half-brothers, if I can say that.</br>   After I came back with this guy again, something happened.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When we were together, he didn't hang out with people like robbers</br>   and stuff like that, but when I was back, you can see all the people right</br>   there. Changing things from the cars, and stealing them, stuff like that.</br>   Yeah. I don't know what happened in his head in that moment, but he threw</br>   me from his house basically with nothing. I didn't have anything left. From</br>   that, I was living on different towns, if you can say. Towns? Until I got</br>   back with my grandparents. We arrange things again, and we got into an</br>   agreement.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I have been living with them since that. That's mostly what—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are you staying out of trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, totally. No more trouble. After that incident, I worked here</br>   at CCSI, but I didn't like it because the supervisors didn't have any… How</br>   can I say it? They didn't have a good organization. They set your breaks</br>   and lunch in certain times. For example, I entered at 2:00. I had my first</br>   break for 15 minutes from 3:00 to 3:15. Then I had my lunch from—it was</br>   half an hour by the way—from 4:00 for 4:30. I had my second break until</br>   9:00 to 9:15, and I didn't like that.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When you had your days off, there wasn't a way that they could tell</br>   you. When you got into the floor, it was like, &quot;Why do you come? You got</br>   your day today. You're not supposed to come.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why don't you</br>   tell us before?&quot; A day before?” I didn't like that. The payment was weekly.</br>   It was not that bad, but I didn't like it. That's when I applied here at</br>   TeleTech. I like it so far. It's good, and the best thing is that I don't</br>   have credentials, so I'm not working.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What does that mean?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Basically in call centers, you have 60 people, and your max</br>   is for 70. A new wave comes in, maybe 15 people, and the five people that</br>   are left—since you already took all of the capacity you're supposed to have</br>   for agents and the rest of them don't have credentials—don't do anything.</br>   You don't work. Let's say you don't work. You just wake up to come to work</br>   and not do anything. That's what not having credentials means.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're getting paid for nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll take it.&quot; Even so, in training, I</br>   consider myself as one of the best of all my wave, because I have the</br>   knowledge, and even though I don't do nothing, they ask me, &quot;Hey, how do</br>   you do this? What's this?&quot; I can tell them. That's not a problem to me. If</br>   I get my credential today, it's like, &quot;You know what? Yeah. Give me them,</br>   I'll start working like I'm supposed to be.&quot; You go to work to have money.</br>   That work, if it applies some responsibilities, you have to do them,</br>   because otherwise, why would you be working? If you don't want to have</br>   responsibilities, you rather be something else, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about socially? Has it been hard to adjust socially, make</br>   friends, girlfriends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. No. The people I have met, they actually helped me here. They</br>   helped me study and everything, so that wasn't a problem at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss most?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad. I miss my dad. Yeah. I miss him. I remember when we used to</br>   go to field trips, and when he took me to his job, when we went to go watch</br>   movies, to the parks, and stuff like that. It's not like any more, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Neither of you ?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We talk through Messenger, WhatsApp, and through phone, right? I</br>   call him or he calls me, and we keep in touch like that. That's the way we</br>   can talk with each other, but right now since I don't have a phone, it's a</br>   little bit harder. If you don't have a phone, you don't have access to</br>   WhatsApp and Messenger. You have to go to a computer, maybe in your house,</br>   maybe in the local. Sometimes you don't have that time to actually go</br>   there, like having your cell phone right on hand. Having mobile data or</br>   WiFi is very different. You can go on the metro, or go on the metro bus, or</br>   in a bus, in a car, and still be talking with him. In this case, I have to</br>   be in a certain spot to actually talk to him. so yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What are your dreams now, now that you're here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Dreams, Relationships, Jobs, College">Carlos: The most important one is finish high school. After that, I want to   study software engineer, and I like it a lot. I like it a lot. I want to   get into a good job. Right now, I have a girlfriend. When I needed it, she   was there for me. I have a very good relationship with her, and I feel a   lot of love for her. If things can happen in the future, I'm willing to   take it. I'd take it. I'll take it because not a lot of girls will help you   the way she helped me, because most of them are not interested on who you   are or what you need, and she was in the moment when I needed it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Language">Over here, you speak Spanish. Here, the system of education for   English is very bad. It's very bad. I always try to hear music in English,   and read books, and stuff like that, and watch movies in English because if   you don't practice it, you'll forget it. You'll forget it. Once you're   older, it is very difficult or is more difficult to learn a language than   when you were little. Getting back here was [Pow sound].     Carlos: They even thought it would be better if I started middle school,   but from the beginning, not onto the third grade that I was supposed to be.   No, in first grade because I didn't know Spanish, and most of the subjects   that are needed for Spanish. I was great in English. They took my English   classes away so I can retake Spanish, but on second level. They were   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,   school was like, I care about it, but not 100%. Since I like soccer, I used   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like   that. They even paid me classes for Spanish and for another subject into   Spanish, so I didn't really have a hard time. I spent two years in those   classes. After that, I'm normal. I can talk Spanish normally and all that   stuff.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Challenges, Continuing education, Language">Carlos: Yes, very hard. Very, very hard. Mostly because I was so into   English and the subjects—well, I don't think they differ a lot, but   obviously history isn't the same. Most of the things aren't the same.   Civics aren't also the same. They have different ones here or there.   Spanish, they have here Spanish, that's a subject. I was like, &quot;What are   these?&quot; They have little, I don't know, like this. This thing right here.   [pointing to accents]    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Family reunification, Family Separation, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in Mexico, Time in the US, New family formation, Mexico, Worst parts about being back, Best parts aboutbeing back">Carlos: It was hard because I felt sad at the moment not being with my dad   and my brothers. Another part, I felt kind good because I had my uncles and   my grandpas. One of my uncles that lived here is one of the ones that I   loved the most, apart from my dad. That was kinda a relief. You put   something bad and put another good thing on top of that, it just kind of   mixes, and at the end, I'm here. That's what I think, right?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Family Separation, Mental Health, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in Mexico, Time in the US, New family formation, Age, Mexico, Feelings, Sadness, Isolation">I don't remember a lot of stuff, mostly because what hit me was   being separated from your dad. I can tell you that with my mom and my dad,   I have lived all my 20 years. I got to see my two brothers little. Right   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my   dad and my brothers.     Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get Saturdays and Sundays off.   I'm barely at their house, but I really appreciate it, that they took care   of me.     Carlos: Most of the times, I think about what would be different from   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a   teenager. Right now that I’m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would   like, right?     Carlos: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most   important thing is being with your actual family than all the economic   stuff or the money. Most important thing is the love and the relationship   you have with them.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School,  extracurriculars, Sports, Music, Sports, Playing,  baseball,  basketball,  track,  soccer, Pastimes">Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a   different way of their system of education. What I liked a lot is that   mostly you get free lunch up in the States, and you get a lot of courses   that are free, and summer activities in school, and they're also free.   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked   it a lot. It's different. I remember my school, they had a big park for a   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.     Anne: Did you play sports?     Carlos: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?     Anne: Track? Track?     Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,   too.     Anne: That's cool.     Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.     Anne: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did   you do music?     Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I   was up into physical education.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Friends">It was fun. I really enjoyed it. I got to make a lot of friends   there. I still talk to them. I still have more than my dad. I have cousins,   uncles, aunts mostly.    </span> Anne: A lot of family was already there.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, but most of my cousins are already US citizens since they</br>   were born there—you automatically get your papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was your dad doing while you were living there?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He works. He worked in that time as a manager in Burger King. He</br>   was doing that. Right now he's working, but in another restaurant, equally</br>   has a manager. I think it's Drivers Cruising, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You went to the US, and probably you didn't know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. None.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, it was very hard. In that time, I'm the biggest son of my dad,</br>   and wouldn't have someone to interact with. Mostly it was my cousin. They</br>   lived a few blocks away from us, so I just hanged out with them. Right now</br>   I can remember they were teasing me for not knowing English. It's kind of</br>   fun once you understand, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you start first grade in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, I started second grade, because I finished first grade here.</br>   Over there I started second grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How'd that go?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Well, I think it would have been worse if I didn't have any other</br>   school friends that were also from Mexico and stuff like that. They had the</br>   same problem. They didn't know how to speak English or so, and we got all</br>   in some courses from school. That's mostly where I ended up learning</br>   English. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: English as a second language courses? ESL courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, I think it was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. There were other friends who were Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. Their fathers are Mexicans, and mostly like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you like school? Did you like learning?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a</br>   different way of their system of education.

Do you make lots of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I remember most of them. I don't know if they remember me,</br>   though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said your Mexican friends really helped you when you were little,</br>   helping you learn the language at all?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you branch out? Did you have friends from all nationalities,</br>   races, or was it mainly did you stick with Mexican friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I stuck with everybody, like African-Americans, US citizens,</br>   Mexican people. Yeah, with everybody.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you feel different?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I never felt different. You never feel different. In my school,</br>   there was no such thing as discrimination or harassments like that, so I</br>   felt good. I wasn't under pressure of students or discrimination or</br>   something like that. It was very good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know you were undocumented? Did you know that that would put</br>   barriers, create barriers for what you could do?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that moment since I was little, I didn't know about the</br>   barriers. I knew I didn't have papers, but I didn't know the consequences</br>   of not having papers. You're little. You would like to play and all that</br>   stuff. Basically, you're a kid, and kids just enjoy life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When did you figure it out?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly when I came here, because in that moment I wasn't really</br>   informed about anything. When I got deported back, I didn't even know about</br>   such things. I thought it would be normal. I didn't even think of having a</br>   job or a social security number, or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I'm 20.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a long story. I had some friends—they were African Americans,</br>   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long</br>   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad</br>   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a</br>   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,</br>   though. Not like the one they have here, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,</br>   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just</br>   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go</br>   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went</br>   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they</br>   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There</br>   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think</br>   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them</br>   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't</br>   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so</br>   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were 15?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Just a child.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The</br>   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, &quot;Hey, you know what? After they</br>   snitch&quot;—and he knew—he was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're about to get</br>   in trouble. We're in a gang.&quot; I really don't remember the name of the gang.</br>   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,</br>   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I didn't see any. I was just like blind. When I got there, I was</br>   blind. I didn't see nothing bad. That's why I didn't suspect anything at</br>   the moment until this guy told me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been in trouble before?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, but not big, big trouble. Since I'm really playful and</br>   anxious, so I need to do something to keep myself calm. In that moment, we</br>   had BB guns, and I didn't know that was bad bringing them to school. I was</br>   getting suspended for that. Also one time, one of our friends took the</br>   little skateboards. I don't remember what the name was, but you can handle</br>   it with your fingers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How big? How big are they?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They're tiny, like this big.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We took all his skateboards from his backpack when we were in</br>   recess. What happened...I didn't know, I thought we’re just going to play</br>   with them. At the end, they told him. His name was Lucious. They told him,</br>   &quot;Hey.&quot; They put me out, like if I were the one who was stealing this stuff.</br>   That was like, &quot;Lucious, Carlos stole your stuff,&quot; and he got mad. He even</br>   hit me, but it's like I didn't even... It's like, &quot;Bro.&quot; It's like, &quot;Why</br>   are you doing this?&quot; Then they explained it to me</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since my grandma—I mostly lived with my grandma back in the</br>   States—didn't know English, every time I was in trouble, my grandma had to</br>   go for me to school and stuff like that. They had one of our friends</br>   translate to her what the teacher or principal was saying.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dad wasn't around?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He wasn't that around because he was working. He mostly works all</br>   day, probably.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It was you and your grandma and him in your house?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, basically. Not really that much in the house, because when I</br>   got there, my dad was hooked up with a girl. I think she was here from</br>   Mexico, too, Puebla, I think. They were together, but that woman, she had a</br>   kid. His name was Eduardo, but he was a US citizen. He's three years older</br>   than me. We got into fights a lot, and she got tired of me. She even kicked</br>   us out. For a few months, it was me and my dad only before my grandma went</br>   to the States. After that, after my grandma got there, I was just living</br>   with my grandma most of the time.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad visited me. And when he got kids, I used to take care of</br>   them when I was in school or my grandma was working, because she also</br>   worked. She was a housekeeper. She had different jobs. Mostly that's what</br>   we were living out of, from the money of my dad and the money that my</br>   grandma was taking out of the housekeeping.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your home life was a little lonely?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the time I was lonely, yeah. Even though in that time, I</br>   enjoyed being lonely because I could go out, go to the park with my</br>   friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hang out with your friends.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, I wasn't bad. I was a good student, but there was one</br>   problem: I was too anxious, so I was always talking, or I was doing</br>   something that got me in trouble.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. You get caught in this robbery that you're unaware of. Then</br>   what? You're 15 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I didn't know what happened, but I was with a judge. I was</br>   little. I really don't remember a lot of stuff. What I do remember is that</br>   they were aware I was a child. I don't think my lawyer spoke with</br>   somebody—I really don't know all the process.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you father come to help?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, he did. We were afraid that he was also going to get deported</br>   of the same situation. Since my grandmother was working for a lot of</br>   houses, one of the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She was undocumented, too?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, my grandma. One of the friends of my grandma, she worked in</br>   her house, she volunteered also to go help me. Basically they ran off with</br>   my dad and lawyer, and the friend, her name was Leanne. I still remember</br>   her. Leanne. I really don't know the process. I was in the correctional—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In a juvenile correctional facility?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you with kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. I was somewhere in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Oregon?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reasons, Deportation">Carlos: Yeah, in ___ Oregon. What basically they told me after the 10 days,   &quot;All right, you need to come back to Mexico.&quot; I needed to come back, so   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to Mexico.   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately   because she has been taking care of me for almost 19 years. Almost 20.   Yeah, almost all my life.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Arrests, Police, Gangs, Resisting affiliation, Activity, Drugs, Selling">Carlos: It's a long story.

I have cousins,   uncles, aunts mostly.    </span> Anne: A lot of family was already there.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, but most of my cousins are already US citizens since they</br>   were born there—you automatically get your papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was your dad doing while you were living there?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He works. He worked in that time as a manager in Burger King. He</br>   was doing that. Right now he's working, but in another restaurant, equally</br>   has a manager. I think it's Drivers Cruising, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You went to the US, and probably you didn't know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. None.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, it was very hard. In that time, I'm the biggest son of my dad,</br>   and wouldn't have someone to interact with. Mostly it was my cousin. They</br>   lived a few blocks away from us, so I just hanged out with them. Right now</br>   I can remember they were teasing me for not knowing English. It's kind of</br>   fun once you understand, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you start first grade in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, I started second grade, because I finished first grade here.</br>   Over there I started second grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How'd that go?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Well, I think it would have been worse if I didn't have any other</br>   school friends that were also from Mexico and stuff like that. They had the</br>   same problem. They didn't know how to speak English or so, and we got all</br>   in some courses from school. That's mostly where I ended up learning</br>   English. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: English as a second language courses? ESL courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, I think it was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. There were other friends who were Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. Their fathers are Mexicans, and mostly like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you like school? Did you like learning?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a</br>   different way of their system of education. What I liked a lot is that</br>   mostly you get free lunch up in the States, and you get a lot of courses</br>   that are free, and summer activities in school, and they're also free.</br>   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked</br>   it a lot. It's different. I remember my school, they had a big park for a</br>   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you play sports?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played</br>   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Track? Track?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,</br>   too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did</br>   you do music?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not</br>   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I</br>   was up into physical education.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. Cool. Do you make lots of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I remember most of them. I don't know if they remember me,</br>   though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said your Mexican friends really helped you when you were little,</br>   helping you learn the language at all?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you branch out? Did you have friends from all nationalities,</br>   races, or was it mainly did you stick with Mexican friends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I stuck with everybody, like African-Americans, US citizens,</br>   Mexican people. Yeah, with everybody.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you feel different?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I never felt different. You never feel different. In my school,</br>   there was no such thing as discrimination or harassments like that, so I</br>   felt good. I wasn't under pressure of students or discrimination or</br>   something like that. It was very good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know you were undocumented?

Basically, you're a kid, and kids just enjoy life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When did you figure it out?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly when I came here, because in that moment I wasn't really</br>   informed about anything. When I got deported back, I didn't even know about</br>   such things. I thought it would be normal. I didn't even think of having a</br>   job or a social security number, or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I'm 20.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why did you come back?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a long story. I had some friends—they were African Americans,</br>   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long</br>   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad</br>   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a</br>   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,</br>   though. Not like the one they have here, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, cool.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,</br>   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just</br>   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go</br>   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went</br>   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they</br>   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There</br>   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think</br>   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them</br>   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't</br>   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so</br>   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were 15?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Just a child.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The</br>   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, &quot;Hey, you know what? After they</br>   snitch&quot;—and he knew—he was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You're about to get</br>   in trouble. We're in a gang.&quot; I really don't remember the name of the gang.</br>   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,</br>   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have guns?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I didn't see any. I was just like blind. When I got there, I was</br>   blind. I didn't see nothing bad. That's why I didn't suspect anything at</br>   the moment until this guy told me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been in trouble before?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, but not big, big trouble. Since I'm really playful and</br>   anxious, so I need to do something to keep myself calm. In that moment, we</br>   had BB guns, and I didn't know that was bad bringing them to school. I was</br>   getting suspended for that. Also one time, one of our friends took the</br>   little skateboards. I don't remember what the name was, but you can handle</br>   it with your fingers.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How big? How big are they?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They're tiny, like this big.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We took all his skateboards from his backpack when we were in</br>   recess. What happened...I didn't know, I thought we’re just going to play</br>   with them. At the end, they told him. His name was Lucious. They told him,</br>   &quot;Hey.&quot; They put me out, like if I were the one who was stealing this stuff.</br>   That was like, &quot;Lucious, Carlos stole your stuff,&quot; and he got mad. He even</br>   hit me, but it's like I didn't even... It's like, &quot;Bro.&quot; It's like, &quot;Why</br>   are you doing this?&quot; Then they explained it to me</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Since my grandma—I mostly lived with my grandma back in the</br>   States—didn't know English, every time I was in trouble, my grandma had to</br>   go for me to school and stuff like that. They had one of our friends</br>   translate to her what the teacher or principal was saying.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dad wasn't around?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He wasn't that around because he was working. He mostly works all</br>   day, probably.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It was you and your grandma and him in your house?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, basically. Not really that much in the house, because when I</br>   got there, my dad was hooked up with a girl. I think she was here from</br>   Mexico, too, Puebla, I think. They were together, but that woman, she had a</br>   kid. His name was Eduardo, but he was a US citizen. He's three years older</br>   than me. We got into fights a lot, and she got tired of me. She even kicked</br>   us out. For a few months, it was me and my dad only before my grandma went</br>   to the States. After that, after my grandma got there, I was just living</br>   with my grandma most of the time.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad visited me. And when he got kids, I used to take care of</br>   them when I was in school or my grandma was working, because she also</br>   worked. She was a housekeeper. She had different jobs. Mostly that's what</br>   we were living out of, from the money of my dad and the money that my</br>   grandma was taking out of the housekeeping.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your home life was a little lonely?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the time I was lonely, yeah. Even though in that time, I</br>   enjoyed being lonely because I could go out, go to the park with my</br>   friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hang out with your friends.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In school, I wasn't bad. I was a good student, but there was one</br>   problem: I was too anxious, so I was always talking, or I was doing</br>   something that got me in trouble.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. You get caught in this robbery that you're unaware of. Then</br>   what? You're 15 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I didn't know what happened, but I was with a judge. I was</br>   little. I really don't remember a lot of stuff. What I do remember is that</br>   they were aware I was a child. I don't think my lawyer spoke with</br>   somebody—I really don't know all the process.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you father come to help?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, he did. We were afraid that he was also going to get deported</br>   of the same situation. Since my grandmother was working for a lot of</br>   houses, one of the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She was undocumented, too?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, my grandma. One of the friends of my grandma, she worked in</br>   her house, she volunteered also to go help me. Basically they ran off with</br>   my dad and lawyer, and the friend, her name was Leanne. I still remember</br>   her. Leanne. I really don't know the process. I was in the correctional—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In a juvenile correctional facility?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you with kids?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. I was somewhere in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Oregon?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, in ___ Oregon. What basically they told me after the 10 days,</br>   &quot;All right, you need to come back to Mexico.&quot; I needed to come back, so</br>   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with</br>   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to Mexico.</br>   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately</br>   because she has been taking care of me for almost 19 years. Almost 20.</br>   Yeah, almost all my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were sent back, do you know if it was long-term departure or</br>   a deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I just know it was deported. I didn't—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a limit as to when you can apply for a visa to go back to</br>   the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I found out here it is was ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Ten years?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: What I heard from a friend is that it also takes another ten years,</br>   so it's basically 20. I really don't know what the difference is. They told</br>   me ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: If it's ten years, then you can start the process after ten years. I</br>   don't know how long the process takes. It's been five, right?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Maybe in five years, it won't take as long as it does now. It's</br>   curious because you're a minor.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I also talked about, with some friends</br>   here, when we all talk about our lives. They were like, &quot;Why did you get</br>   deported? You were so young.&quot; Stuff like that. It's like, &quot;Bro, I don't</br>   know. I was young. I didn't know anything until they told me everything.&quot;</br>   You don't realize about things until you're older, and so you know really</br>   what happens, and what are the laws.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You weren't even young enough to know that you couldn't get a</br>   driver's license, or maybe you could in Oregon. I think you can, but you</br>   weren't old enough to know what you couldn't do as an undocumented kid.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you hadn't experienced that. I don't know the laws, but I</br>   imagine that since your family members were undocumented—</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, that's why I think my family didn't put a lot of pressure</br>   into that, because they were also undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They would have been deported, as well.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: If my dad goes, my brothers will be alone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a record? Given that crime, were you convicted of that</br>   crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think not. I'm not sure. I have to ask my dad. He knows all about</br>   it, but we never talk about that stuff. We always talk about, &quot;How are you?</br>   What you've been doing?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: There was a trial?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Hm?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there a trial for the crime?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think it was, but I really don't remember</br>   that as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you weren't...</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I don't remember a lot of stuff, mostly because what hit me was</br>   being separated from your dad. I can tell you that with my mom and my dad,</br>   I have lived all my 20 years. I got to see my two brothers little. Right</br>   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I</br>   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my</br>   dad and my brothers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with</br>   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at</br>   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of</br>   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're</br>   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can</br>   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get Saturdays and Sundays off.</br>   I'm barely at their house, but I really appreciate it, that they took care</br>   of me.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Most of the times, I think about what would be different from</br>   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.</br>   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you</br>   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not</br>   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a</br>   teenager. Right now that I’m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't</br>   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would</br>   like, right?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you</br>   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most</br>   important thing is being with your actual family than all the economic</br>   stuff or the money. Most important thing is the love and the relationship</br>   you have with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're a 15 year old kid and you're being deported. Where do they</br>   take you? What do they do with you, the ICE [Immigration and Customs</br>   Enforcement]?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was ten days in the States before they deported me. After that, I</br>   just remember I went to the border, and my family picked me up.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They called your family to have them come pick you up?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly my dad. They came to pick me up, and then we just took a</br>   flight over to Mexico City. That's it. Being here wasn't really easy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your family had been from Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then they brought you back. Hopefully the ICE agents were taking</br>   care of you until you got to them. You were a minor. They must have had the</br>   responsibility to make sure that you got into proper hands. This is</br>   dangerous.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Mostly on the border, there's a lot of drug dealers and</br>   cartels and stuff like that, now that I know of. In the moment, I really</br>   didn't know about anything. I didn't really care about Mexico anymore. I</br>   was hoping I would stay there for a long time, grow up, get a job,</br>   probably. Finish college. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your dreams in the US were to do what?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: To study and get a job, and to live there, getting a partner, to</br>   get married, and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Who met you? Which family met you at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was the family from my father. My grandpa that I lived with, and</br>   some aunts.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know them?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. Yeah, because in here when I was little, I used to the with</br>   them a lot of time. Even here before I went to the States, I was mischief.</br>   To be honest, my situation in school has always been problems, problems,</br>   problems because here in Mexico I used to get into the ceilings of the</br>   schools, and throwing pencils, and hitting people, and all this stuff. That</br>   was when I was here. I usually went to a school that was most for kids that</br>   are misbehaving.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Even when you were six?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes. When I was six. I got expelled from a school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In kindergarten or first grade?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: First grade. It all happened in first grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think that's why your dad brought you to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. He mostly wanted me back because he wanted to be with me,</br>   right? I don't know a father, or maybe there are some cases, but I don't</br>   know of a father that wouldn't like to be with their children.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You never got expelled from a school in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No, never. Yeah. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did good.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Great. You came back, resumed living where you had lived in the first</br>   six years of your life?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, in the same house.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me how you felt.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It was hard because I felt sad at the moment not being with my dad</br>   and my brothers. Another part, I felt kind good because I had my uncles and</br>   my grandpas. One of my uncles that lived here is one of the ones that I</br>   loved the most, apart from my dad. That was kinda a relief. You put</br>   something bad and put another good thing on top of that, it just kind of</br>   mixes, and at the end, I'm here. That's what I think, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far have you gotten in school? You were 15, so?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I think it was seventh grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Seventh?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Seventh. Up in the States, seventh grade, something like that. When</br>   I got here, I finished middle school. I don't know what grade. It was</br>   eighth grade, I think? Something like that. Here, they handle it different,</br>   because you have elementary school, six years, then middle school, three</br>   years, and after that, high school that is also three years, and off to</br>   college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard getting back into the school system here?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, very hard. Very, very hard. Mostly because I was so into</br>   English and the subjects—well, I don't think they differ a lot, but</br>   obviously history isn't the same. Most of the things aren't the same.</br>   Civics aren't also the same. They have different ones here or there.</br>   Spanish, they have here Spanish, that's a subject. I was like, &quot;What are</br>   these?&quot; They have little, I don't know, like this. This thing right here.</br>   [pointing to accents]</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I was like, &quot;Where do you put that? Why do you put that?&quot; Yeah, it</br>   was very hard for me because, for instance, I didn't talk a lot of Spanish.</br>   I didn't know a lot of Spanish.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you learned to read Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had to?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, because even right now, I don't like to read in</br>   Spanish. I prefer English. If somebody gets me a book, &quot;You know what? Can</br>   you get me a book, but it’s English?&quot; Because I don't like reading in</br>   Spanish a lot, mostly because of the practice, you know? I want to keep my</br>   English a little bit more fluid. Right now having a little bit of troubles</br>   pronouncing words and stuff like that, because it’s not the same. You speak</br>   it every day and write it every day up in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Over here, you speak Spanish. Here, the system of education for</br>   English is very bad. It's very bad. I always try to hear music in English,</br>   and read books, and stuff like that, and watch movies in English because if</br>   you don't practice it, you'll forget it. You'll forget it. Once you're</br>   older, it is very difficult or is more difficult to learn a language than</br>   when you were little. Getting back here was [Pow sound].</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: They even thought it would be better if I started middle school,</br>   but from the beginning, not onto the third grade that I was supposed to be.</br>   No, in first grade because I didn't know Spanish, and most of the subjects</br>   that are needed for Spanish. I was great in English. They took my English</br>   classes away so I can retake Spanish, but on second level. They were</br>   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I</br>   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I</br>   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,</br>   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,</br>   school was like, I care about it, but not 100%. Since I like soccer, I used</br>   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.</br>   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like</br>   that. They even paid me classes for Spanish and for another subject into</br>   Spanish, so I didn't really have a hard time. I spent two years in those</br>   classes. After that, I'm normal. I can talk Spanish normally and all that</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How far have you gotten in high school?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Let's say I finished. I already went past through the last grade,</br>   that is the third grade here, but I still haven't passed six subjects. So,</br>   I don't have my certificates. I haven't finished high school still.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Will you?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, I will, and I want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does it mean taking tests, or does it mean actually taking courses?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Taking the test of the subjects that you haven't passed, and most</br>   of them are very difficult. I studied in my school. It's from the, I don't</br>   know if you heard of Instituto Politécnico Nacional.</br> </br> </br>   .</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. It's the high schools from that institute. All of them have</br>   specialties. They got construction, they got electricity. There's, how can</br>   I say it? There's also for the planes, and how to fix them for mechanics,</br>   cars. There's another one, but I really don't know. It's industrial</br>   processes or something like that? That would be the translation of what I</br>   know of.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I got electricity, but the subjects that I failed on are the</br>   hardest ones. To be true, I have been trying to finish it for five years.</br>   From the point I got into school, first grade, second grade, and third</br>   grade, I have taken five years and counting. I really want to finish high</br>   school, because it helps speaking English, mostly because they don't have a</br>   lot of jobs that are well paid here. Having to know or getting to speak</br>   English is a bonus. Right now, I'm in a job that, they don't pay you that</br>   bad if you're single, you don't have kids, it's okay, but once you have a</br>   family? No. It's not a lot of money for having a family. It's just for one</br>   person.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is that job?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's a call center right here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Teletech?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah, Teletech, right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long you been working there?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Right now, I have two months, but I've been working into Vista,</br>   CompuCom, CCSI, it's one right there on that street.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Why do you keep changing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: On the first one, my first job was 2017, I was still studying. In</br>   that time, I didn't have my subjects, not a pass or anything. I was good. I</br>   always studied in the afternoon. It was from 2:00 to 10:00. I worked from</br>   8:00 to 3:00. I was half-time, but I really couldn't, it was a lot of</br>   pressure, and I was like, &quot;You know what? I'm going to quit. It's okay. I</br>   may want money, but I think it's not the time.&quot; Then after that, I worked</br>   at CompuCom. That's more technical service related. It's not like you're</br>   assisting customers.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: You're assisting the users of a company, the people who work there,</br>   not the customers. I like that a lot. It's more technical support. It's</br>   better than customer service. Customer service, you get a lot of angry</br>   customers, and they yell at you, and all that stuff [Anne laughs]. That's</br>   where I worked. I worked there six months—that was one year after. In that</br>   time, I already finished, partially finished, school. I was there to make</br>   money, because I decided that it was time for me to work, and I started</br>   making money.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: In that point, I had some problems with my grandma and my grandpa,</br>   so I left the house. I met there in CompuCom before that a guy, and we were</br>   best friends. We were always together. He was like, &quot;Hey, if anything</br>   happens, you can go to my house, to my crib,&quot; and all that stuff. Like,</br>   &quot;Okay, bet.&quot; We even took our stuff, my stuff from my house all the way to</br>   his house. It's a two-hour trip.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: It's [foreign – location/Insurgentes 00:40:26], basically. I was</br>   good with him, but in that moment, something happened: I started drinking</br>   and stuff, so I really much care less for my job, started going down, and</br>   stuff like that. I got fired eventually.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Kind of, because the problems that I also had with my family took</br>   over the situation. With him, I bought a lot of stuff. I bought shoes,</br>   shirts, and all that stuff. I was living with him until August. That's when</br>   my mom contacted me. She lives right now in Queretaro. I was just going to</br>   visit her for two or three weeks, but I stayed two months. I stayed two</br>   months with her and with my brothers—half-brothers, if I can say that.</br>   After I came back with this guy again, something happened.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When we were together, he didn't hang out with people like robbers</br>   and stuff like that, but when I was back, you can see all the people right</br>   there. Changing things from the cars, and stealing them, stuff like that.</br>   Yeah. I don't know what happened in his head in that moment, but he threw</br>   me from his house basically with nothing. I didn't have anything left. From</br>   that, I was living on different towns, if you can say. Towns? Until I got</br>   back with my grandparents. We arrange things again, and we got into an</br>   agreement.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: I have been living with them since that. That's mostly what—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are you staying out of trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yes, totally. No more trouble. After that incident, I worked here</br>   at CCSI, but I didn't like it because the supervisors didn't have any… How</br>   can I say it? They didn't have a good organization. They set your breaks</br>   and lunch in certain times. For example, I entered at 2:00. I had my first</br>   break for 15 minutes from 3:00 to 3:15. Then I had my lunch from—it was</br>   half an hour by the way—from 4:00 for 4:30. I had my second break until</br>   9:00 to 9:15, and I didn't like that.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: When you had your days off, there wasn't a way that they could tell</br>   you. When you got into the floor, it was like, &quot;Why do you come? You got</br>   your day today. You're not supposed to come.&quot; I was like, &quot;Why don't you</br>   tell us before?&quot; A day before?” I didn't like that. The payment was weekly.</br>   It was not that bad, but I didn't like it. That's when I applied here at</br>   TeleTech. I like it so far. It's good, and the best thing is that I don't</br>   have credentials, so I'm not working.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What does that mean?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Yeah. Basically in call centers, you have 60 people, and your max</br>   is for 70. A new wave comes in, maybe 15 people, and the five people that</br>   are left—since you already took all of the capacity you're supposed to have</br>   for agents and the rest of them don't have credentials—don't do anything.</br>   You don't work. Let's say you don't work. You just wake up to come to work</br>   and not do anything. That's what not having credentials means.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're getting paid for nothing?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Exactly. I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll take it.&quot; Even so, in training, I</br>   consider myself as one of the best of all my wave, because I have the</br>   knowledge, and even though I don't do nothing, they ask me, &quot;Hey, how do</br>   you do this? What's this?&quot; I can tell them. That's not a problem to me. If</br>   I get my credential today, it's like, &quot;You know what? Yeah. Give me them,</br>   I'll start working like I'm supposed to be.&quot; You go to work to have money.</br>   That work, if it applies some responsibilities, you have to do them,</br>   because otherwise, why would you be working? If you don't want to have</br>   responsibilities, you rather be something else, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about socially? Has it been hard to adjust socially, make</br>   friends, girlfriends?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: No. No. The people I have met, they actually helped me here. They</br>   helped me study and everything, so that wasn't a problem at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss most?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: My dad. I miss my dad. Yeah. I miss him. I remember when we used to</br>   go to field trips, and when he took me to his job, when we went to go watch</br>   movies, to the parks, and stuff like that. It's not like any more, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Neither of you ?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: We talk through Messenger, WhatsApp, and through phone, right? I</br>   call him or he calls me, and we keep in touch like that. That's the way we</br>   can talk with each other, but right now since I don't have a phone, it's a</br>   little bit harder. If you don't have a phone, you don't have access to</br>   WhatsApp and Messenger. You have to go to a computer, maybe in your house,</br>   maybe in the local. Sometimes you don't have that time to actually go</br>   there, like having your cell phone right on hand. Having mobile data or</br>   WiFi is very different. You can go on the metro, or go on the metro bus, or</br>   in a bus, in a car, and still be talking with him. In this case, I have to</br>   be in a certain spot to actually talk to him. so yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What are your dreams now, now that you're here?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: The most important one is finish high school. After that, I want to</br>   study software engineer, and I like it a lot. I like it a lot. I want to</br>   get into a good job. Right now, I have a girlfriend. When I needed it, she</br>   was there for me. I have a very good relationship with her, and I feel a</br>   lot of love for her. If things can happen in the future, I'm willing to</br>   take it. I'd take it. I'll take it because not a lot of girls will help you</br>   the way she helped me, because most of them are not interested on who you</br>   are or what you need, and she was in the moment when I needed it.</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: That's why I feel a lot of love for her. That's a relationship. I</br>   want to go back to the States, even though I know it's harder, getting a</br>   job, but I really want to go with my dad, to be with my dad. Yeah. I want</br>   to be with him, with my brothers. I want to spend more time in my life with</br>   them. The time I didn't have in the past, I want to have it in the future.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: We're going to stop at this point, but is there anything that you</br>   would like to say to people about you and your experiences that you haven't</br>   said yet? Is there anything you want to leave with?</br> </br> </br>   Carlos: Mostly a lot of immigrants don't have where to go or people to care</br>   them. You know, what I've learned is that there is always a person who can</br>   take care of you. There's always good people that care for you. You know</br>   what? After all the problems, everything, I believe in God, I think God</br>   puts the way, correct way so you can live again, so you will not feel</br>   depressed. You just got to believe. You got to have faith that everything</br>   is going to be all right at the end of the day, and that even if you feel</br>   alone, you're not alone. There's always somebody taking care of you. Even</br>   though if you don't know them, or you haven't seen them, there's always</br>   somebody that takes care of you.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Thank you so much.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
