   Carlos: When I left here in Mexico, I was six years old. Mostly I left<br>
   because my dad lives there and he wanted me to live with him. I went there<br>
   because of him. While I went there, I was crossed through the border, but I<br>
   really don't remember—I was six years old. I just remember that I was in a<br>
   house, then they took me in a car, and then I woke up at another house, and<br>
   then at another house until I got to California, I think, and that's where<br>
   my dad picked me up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you go alone?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, by myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Who did you leave behind?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I left behind my grandpa, my cousins, my uncles. My mom, mostly,<br>
   even though I haven't lived with her, but I left my mom. Some brothers I<br>
   have, also. That's what I left behind.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Was it hard to leave them behind?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Well, I can remember that part, and it was hard. You're a kid.<br>
   You've been living with your grandpa for six years. You know your dad, but<br>
   it's not like you have a big memory of him or a bond with him, right? Yeah.<br>
   I remember that when I left, I cried. But, when I got to see my father, I<br>
   was joyful. I was happy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You went to California?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah—while we lived in Oregon. They dropped me basically off at<br>
   California. My dad just went in with a car to California, and then we go<br>
   back.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Was he living in the US with papers?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: No, he doesn't have papers. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You came over without... Over the border, you crossed the border.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Exactly. Just like him, but younger.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: He and your mom had split up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Since the beginning, yeah. They never were married or together.<br>
   They just had me and that's it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Tell me about your time in ____.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: It was fun. I really enjoyed it. I got to make a lot of friends<br>
   there. I still talk to them. I still have more than my dad. I have cousins,<br>
   uncles, aunts mostly.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: A lot of family was already there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, but most of my cousins are already US citizens since they<br>
   were born there—you automatically get your papers.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: What was your dad doing while you were living there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: He works. He worked in that time as a manager in Burger King. He<br>
   was doing that. Right now he's working, but in another restaurant, equally<br>
   has a manager. I think it's Drivers Cruising, something like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You went to the US, and probably you didn't know any English?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Exactly. None.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Was it hard?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yes, it was very hard. In that time, I'm the biggest son of my dad,<br>
   and wouldn't have someone to interact with. Mostly it was my cousin. They<br>
   lived a few blocks away from us, so I just hanged out with them. Right now<br>
   I can remember they were teasing me for not knowing English. It's kind of<br>
   fun once you understand, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you start first grade in the US?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: No, I started second grade, because I finished first grade here.<br>
   Over there I started second grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How'd that go?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Well, I think it would have been worse if I didn't have any other<br>
   school friends that were also from Mexico and stuff like that. They had the<br>
   same problem. They didn't know how to speak English or so, and we got all<br>
   in some courses from school. That's mostly where I ended up learning<br>
   English. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: English as a second language courses? ESL courses?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yes, I think it was, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Yeah, yeah. There were other friends who were Mexican?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Exactly. Their fathers are Mexicans, and mostly like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you like school? Did you like learning?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a<br>
   different way of their system of education. What I liked a lot is that<br>
   mostly you get free lunch up in the States, and you get a lot of courses<br>
   that are free, and summer activities in school, and they're also free.<br>
   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked<br>
   it a lot. It's different. I remember my school, they had a big park for a<br>
   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you play sports?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played<br>
   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Track? Track?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,<br>
   too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's cool.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did<br>
   you do music?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not<br>
   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I<br>
   was up into physical education.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I see. Cool. Do you make lots of friends?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, I remember most of them. I don't know if they remember me,<br>
   though.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You said your Mexican friends really helped you when you were little,<br>
   helping you learn the language at all?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you branch out? Did you have friends from all nationalities,<br>
   races, or was it mainly did you stick with Mexican friends?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I stuck with everybody, like African-Americans, US citizens,<br>
   Mexican people. Yeah, with everybody.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you feel different?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I never felt different. You never feel different. In my school,<br>
   there was no such thing as discrimination or harassments like that, so I<br>
   felt good. I wasn't under pressure of students or discrimination or<br>
   something like that. It was very good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you know you were undocumented? Did you know that that would put<br>
   barriers, create barriers for what you could do?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: In that moment since I was little, I didn't know about the<br>
   barriers. I knew I didn't have papers, but I didn't know the consequences<br>
   of not having papers. You're little. You would like to play and all that<br>
   stuff. Basically, you're a kid, and kids just enjoy life.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: When did you figure it out?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Mostly when I came here, because in that moment I wasn't really<br>
   informed about anything. When I got deported back, I didn't even know about<br>
   such things. I thought it would be normal. I didn't even think of having a<br>
   job or a social security number, or something like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How old are you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Right now, I'm 20.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How old were you when you came back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: 15.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you get in trouble?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Why did you come back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: It's a long story. I had some friends—they were African Americans,<br>
   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long<br>
   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad<br>
   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a<br>
   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,<br>
   though. Not like the one they have here, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Yeah, cool.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,<br>
   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just<br>
   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go<br>
   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went<br>
   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they<br>
   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There<br>
   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think<br>
   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them<br>
   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't<br>
   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so<br>
   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You were 15?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: 15.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Just a child.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Were you part of a gang?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The<br>
   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, "Hey, you know what? After they<br>
   snitch"—and he knew—he was like, "Hey, you know what? You're about to get<br>
   in trouble. We're in a gang." I really don't remember the name of the gang.<br>
   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,<br>
   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did they have guns?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Hm?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did they have guns?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I didn't see any. I was just like blind. When I got there, I was<br>
   blind. I didn't see nothing bad. That's why I didn't suspect anything at<br>
   the moment until this guy told me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Had you been in trouble before?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: In school, but not big, big trouble. Since I'm really playful and<br>
   anxious, so I need to do something to keep myself calm. In that moment, we<br>
   had BB guns, and I didn't know that was bad bringing them to school. I was<br>
   getting suspended for that. Also one time, one of our friends took the<br>
   little skateboards. I don't remember what the name was, but you can handle<br>
   it with your fingers.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How big? How big are they?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: They're tiny, like this big.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: We took all his skateboards from his backpack when we were in<br>
   recess. What happened...I didn't know, I thought we’re just going to play<br>
   with them. At the end, they told him. His name was Lucious. They told him,<br>
   "Hey." They put me out, like if I were the one who was stealing this stuff.<br>
   That was like, "Lucious, Carlos stole your stuff," and he got mad. He even<br>
   hit me, but it's like I didn't even... It's like, "Bro." It's like, "Why<br>
   are you doing this?" Then they explained it to me<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Since my grandma—I mostly lived with my grandma back in the<br>
   States—didn't know English, every time I was in trouble, my grandma had to<br>
   go for me to school and stuff like that. They had one of our friends<br>
   translate to her what the teacher or principal was saying.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Your dad wasn't around?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: He wasn't that around because he was working. He mostly works all<br>
   day, probably.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: It was you and your grandma and him in your house?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, basically. Not really that much in the house, because when I<br>
   got there, my dad was hooked up with a girl. I think she was here from<br>
   Mexico, too, Puebla, I think. They were together, but that woman, she had a<br>
   kid. His name was Eduardo, but he was a US citizen. He's three years older<br>
   than me. We got into fights a lot, and she got tired of me. She even kicked<br>
   us out. For a few months, it was me and my dad only before my grandma went<br>
   to the States. After that, after my grandma got there, I was just living<br>
   with my grandma most of the time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: My dad visited me. And when he got kids, I used to take care of<br>
   them when I was in school or my grandma was working, because she also<br>
   worked. She was a housekeeper. She had different jobs. Mostly that's what<br>
   we were living out of, from the money of my dad and the money that my<br>
   grandma was taking out of the housekeeping.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yep.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Your home life was a little lonely?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Most of the time I was lonely, yeah. Even though in that time, I<br>
   enjoyed being lonely because I could go out, go to the park with my<br>
   friends.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Hang out with your friends.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: In school, I wasn't bad. I was a good student, but there was one<br>
   problem: I was too anxious, so I was always talking, or I was doing<br>
   something that got me in trouble.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Okay. You get caught in this robbery that you're unaware of. Then<br>
   what? You're 15 years old?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Exactly. I didn't know what happened, but I was with a judge. I was<br>
   little. I really don't remember a lot of stuff. What I do remember is that<br>
   they were aware I was a child. I don't think my lawyer spoke with<br>
   somebody—I really don't know all the process.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you father come to help?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, he did. We were afraid that he was also going to get deported<br>
   of the same situation. Since my grandmother was working for a lot of<br>
   houses, one of the—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: She was undocumented, too?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, my grandma. One of the friends of my grandma, she worked in<br>
   her house, she volunteered also to go help me. Basically they ran off with<br>
   my dad and lawyer, and the friend, her name was Leanne. I still remember<br>
   her. Leanne. I really don't know the process. I was in the correctional—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: In a juvenile correctional facility?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Were you with kids?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yes. I was somewhere in ____.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: In Oregon?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, in ___ Oregon. What basically they told me after the 10 days,<br>
   "All right, you need to come back to Mexico." I needed to come back, so<br>
   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with<br>
   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to Mexico.<br>
   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately<br>
   because she has been taking care of me for almost 19 years. Almost 20.<br>
   Yeah, almost all my life.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: When you were sent back, do you know if it was long-term departure or<br>
   a deportation?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I just know it was deported. I didn't—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Do you have a limit as to when you can apply for a visa to go back to<br>
   the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: What I found out here it is was ten years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Ten years?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: What I heard from a friend is that it also takes another ten years,<br>
   so it's basically 20. I really don't know what the difference is. They told<br>
   me ten years.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: If it's ten years, then you can start the process after ten years. I<br>
   don't know how long the process takes. It's been five, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Maybe in five years, it won't take as long as it does now. It's<br>
   curious because you're a minor.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, that's what I also talked about, with some friends<br>
   here, when we all talk about our lives. They were like, "Why did you get<br>
   deported? You were so young." Stuff like that. It's like, "Bro, I don't<br>
   know. I was young. I didn't know anything until they told me everything."<br>
   You don't realize about things until you're older, and so you know really<br>
   what happens, and what are the laws.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You weren't even young enough to know that you couldn't get a<br>
   driver's license, or maybe you could in Oregon. I think you can, but you<br>
   weren't old enough to know what you couldn't do as an undocumented kid.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Because you hadn't experienced that. I don't know the laws, but I<br>
   imagine that since your family members were undocumented—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, that's why I think my family didn't put a lot of pressure<br>
   into that, because they were also undocumented.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: They would have been deported, as well.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: If my dad goes, my brothers will be alone.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Do you have a record? Given that crime, were you convicted of that<br>
   crime?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I think not. I'm not sure. I have to ask my dad. He knows all about<br>
   it, but we never talk about that stuff. We always talk about, "How are you?<br>
   What you've been doing?"<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Was there a trial?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yep.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: There was a trial?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Hm?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Was there a trial for the crime?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think it was, but I really don't remember<br>
   that as well.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Because you weren't...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I don't remember a lot of stuff, mostly because what hit me was<br>
   being separated from your dad. I can tell you that with my mom and my dad,<br>
   I have lived all my 20 years. I got to see my two brothers little. Right<br>
   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I<br>
   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my<br>
   dad and my brothers.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with<br>
   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at<br>
   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of<br>
   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're<br>
   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can<br>
   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get Saturdays and Sundays off.<br>
   I'm barely at their house, but I really appreciate it, that they took care<br>
   of me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Most of the times, I think about what would be different from<br>
   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.<br>
   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you<br>
   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not<br>
   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a<br>
   teenager. Right now that I’m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't<br>
   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would<br>
   like, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you<br>
   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most<br>
   important thing is being with your actual family than all the economic<br>
   stuff or the money. Most important thing is the love and the relationship<br>
   you have with them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You're a 15 year old kid and you're being deported. Where do they<br>
   take you? What do they do with you, the ICE [Immigration and Customs<br>
   Enforcement]?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I was ten days in the States before they deported me. After that, I<br>
   just remember I went to the border, and my family picked me up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: They called your family to have them come pick you up?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Mostly my dad. They came to pick me up, and then we just took a<br>
   flight over to Mexico City. That's it. Being here wasn't really easy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Your family had been from Mexico City?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: They met you at the border?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yep.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And then they brought you back. Hopefully the ICE agents were taking<br>
   care of you until you got to them. You were a minor. They must have had the<br>
   responsibility to make sure that you got into proper hands. This is<br>
   dangerous.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah. Mostly on the border, there's a lot of drug dealers and<br>
   cartels and stuff like that, now that I know of. In the moment, I really<br>
   didn't know about anything. I didn't really care about Mexico anymore. I<br>
   was hoping I would stay there for a long time, grow up, get a job,<br>
   probably. Finish college. Everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Your dreams in the US were to do what?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: To study and get a job, and to live there, getting a partner, to<br>
   get married, and stuff like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Who met you? Which family met you at the border?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: It was the family from my father. My grandpa that I lived with, and<br>
   some aunts.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you know them?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yes. Yeah, because in here when I was little, I used to the with<br>
   them a lot of time. Even here before I went to the States, I was mischief.<br>
   To be honest, my situation in school has always been problems, problems,<br>
   problems because here in Mexico I used to get into the ceilings of the<br>
   schools, and throwing pencils, and hitting people, and all this stuff. That<br>
   was when I was here. I usually went to a school that was most for kids that<br>
   are misbehaving.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Even when you were six?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yes. When I was six. I got expelled from a school here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: In kindergarten or first grade?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: First grade. It all happened in first grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Do you think that's why your dad brought you to the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: No. He mostly wanted me back because he wanted to be with me,<br>
   right? I don't know a father, or maybe there are some cases, but I don't<br>
   know of a father that wouldn't like to be with their children.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You never got expelled from a school in the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: No, never. Yeah. [Laughs].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You did good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Great. You came back, resumed living where you had lived in the first<br>
   six years of your life?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, in the same house.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Tell me how you felt.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: It was hard because I felt sad at the moment not being with my dad<br>
   and my brothers. Another part, I felt kind good because I had my uncles and<br>
   my grandpas. One of my uncles that lived here is one of the ones that I<br>
   loved the most, apart from my dad. That was kinda a relief. You put<br>
   something bad and put another good thing on top of that, it just kind of<br>
   mixes, and at the end, I'm here. That's what I think, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How far have you gotten in school? You were 15, so?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I think it was seventh grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Seventh?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Seventh. Up in the States, seventh grade, something like that. When<br>
   I got here, I finished middle school. I don't know what grade. It was<br>
   eighth grade, I think? Something like that. Here, they handle it different,<br>
   because you have elementary school, six years, then middle school, three<br>
   years, and after that, high school that is also three years, and off to<br>
   college.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Was it hard getting back into the school system here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yes, very hard. Very, very hard. Mostly because I was so into<br>
   English and the subjects—well, I don't think they differ a lot, but<br>
   obviously history isn't the same. Most of the things aren't the same.<br>
   Civics aren't also the same. They have different ones here or there.<br>
   Spanish, they have here Spanish, that's a subject. I was like, "What are<br>
   these?" They have little, I don't know, like this. This thing right here.<br>
   [pointing to accents]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I was like, "Where do you put that? Why do you put that?" Yeah, it<br>
   was very hard for me because, for instance, I didn't talk a lot of Spanish.<br>
   I didn't know a lot of Spanish.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Have you learned to read Spanish?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You had to?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah. Yeah, because even right now, I don't like to read in<br>
   Spanish. I prefer English. If somebody gets me a book, "You know what? Can<br>
   you get me a book, but it’s English?" Because I don't like reading in<br>
   Spanish a lot, mostly because of the practice, you know? I want to keep my<br>
   English a little bit more fluid. Right now having a little bit of troubles<br>
   pronouncing words and stuff like that, because it’s not the same. You speak<br>
   it every day and write it every day up in the States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Over here, you speak Spanish. Here, the system of education for<br>
   English is very bad. It's very bad. I always try to hear music in English,<br>
   and read books, and stuff like that, and watch movies in English because if<br>
   you don't practice it, you'll forget it. You'll forget it. Once you're<br>
   older, it is very difficult or is more difficult to learn a language than<br>
   when you were little. Getting back here was [Pow sound].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: They even thought it would be better if I started middle school,<br>
   but from the beginning, not onto the third grade that I was supposed to be.<br>
   No, in first grade because I didn't know Spanish, and most of the subjects<br>
   that are needed for Spanish. I was great in English. They took my English<br>
   classes away so I can retake Spanish, but on second level. They were<br>
   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I<br>
   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I<br>
   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,<br>
   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,<br>
   school was like, I care about it, but not 100%. Since I like soccer, I used<br>
   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.<br>
   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like<br>
   that. They even paid me classes for Spanish and for another subject into<br>
   Spanish, so I didn't really have a hard time. I spent two years in those<br>
   classes. After that, I'm normal. I can talk Spanish normally and all that<br>
   stuff.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How far have you gotten in high school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Let's say I finished. I already went past through the last grade,<br>
   that is the third grade here, but I still haven't passed six subjects. So,<br>
   I don't have my certificates. I haven't finished high school still.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Will you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, I will, and I want to.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Does it mean taking tests, or does it mean actually taking courses?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Taking the test of the subjects that you haven't passed, and most<br>
   of them are very difficult. I studied in my school. It's from the, I don't<br>
   know if you heard of Instituto Politécnico Nacional.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   .<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah. It's the high schools from that institute. All of them have<br>
   specialties. They got construction, they got electricity. There's, how can<br>
   I say it? There's also for the planes, and how to fix them for mechanics,<br>
   cars. There's another one, but I really don't know. It's industrial<br>
   processes or something like that? That would be the translation of what I<br>
   know of.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I got electricity, but the subjects that I failed on are the<br>
   hardest ones. To be true, I have been trying to finish it for five years.<br>
   From the point I got into school, first grade, second grade, and third<br>
   grade, I have taken five years and counting. I really want to finish high<br>
   school, because it helps speaking English, mostly because they don't have a<br>
   lot of jobs that are well paid here. Having to know or getting to speak<br>
   English is a bonus. Right now, I'm in a job that, they don't pay you that<br>
   bad if you're single, you don't have kids, it's okay, but once you have a<br>
   family? No. It's not a lot of money for having a family. It's just for one<br>
   person.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: What is that job?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: It's a call center right here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Teletech?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah, Teletech, right there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How long you been working there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Right now, I have two months, but I've been working into Vista,<br>
   CompuCom, CCSI, it's one right there on that street.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Why do you keep changing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: On the first one, my first job was 2017, I was still studying. In<br>
   that time, I didn't have my subjects, not a pass or anything. I was good. I<br>
   always studied in the afternoon. It was from 2:00 to 10:00. I worked from<br>
   8:00 to 3:00. I was half-time, but I really couldn't, it was a lot of<br>
   pressure, and I was like, "You know what? I'm going to quit. It's okay. I<br>
   may want money, but I think it's not the time." Then after that, I worked<br>
   at CompuCom. That's more technical service related. It's not like you're<br>
   assisting customers.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: You're assisting the users of a company, the people who work there,<br>
   not the customers. I like that a lot. It's more technical support. It's<br>
   better than customer service. Customer service, you get a lot of angry<br>
   customers, and they yell at you, and all that stuff [Anne laughs]. That's<br>
   where I worked. I worked there six months—that was one year after. In that<br>
   time, I already finished, partially finished, school. I was there to make<br>
   money, because I decided that it was time for me to work, and I started<br>
   making money.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: In that point, I had some problems with my grandma and my grandpa,<br>
   so I left the house. I met there in CompuCom before that a guy, and we were<br>
   best friends. We were always together. He was like, "Hey, if anything<br>
   happens, you can go to my house, to my crib," and all that stuff. Like,<br>
   "Okay, bet." We even took our stuff, my stuff from my house all the way to<br>
   his house. It's a two-hour trip.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Wow.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: It's [foreign – location/Insurgentes 00:40:26], basically. I was<br>
   good with him, but in that moment, something happened: I started drinking<br>
   and stuff, so I really much care less for my job, started going down, and<br>
   stuff like that. I got fired eventually.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Were you depressed?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Kind of, because the problems that I also had with my family took<br>
   over the situation. With him, I bought a lot of stuff. I bought shoes,<br>
   shirts, and all that stuff. I was living with him until August. That's when<br>
   my mom contacted me. She lives right now in Queretaro. I was just going to<br>
   visit her for two or three weeks, but I stayed two months. I stayed two<br>
   months with her and with my brothers—half-brothers, if I can say that.<br>
   After I came back with this guy again, something happened.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: When we were together, he didn't hang out with people like robbers<br>
   and stuff like that, but when I was back, you can see all the people right<br>
   there. Changing things from the cars, and stealing them, stuff like that.<br>
   Yeah. I don't know what happened in his head in that moment, but he threw<br>
   me from his house basically with nothing. I didn't have anything left. From<br>
   that, I was living on different towns, if you can say. Towns? Until I got<br>
   back with my grandparents. We arrange things again, and we got into an<br>
   agreement.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: I have been living with them since that. That's mostly what—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Are you staying out of trouble?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yes, totally. No more trouble. After that incident, I worked here<br>
   at CCSI, but I didn't like it because the supervisors didn't have any… How<br>
   can I say it? They didn't have a good organization. They set your breaks<br>
   and lunch in certain times. For example, I entered at 2:00. I had my first<br>
   break for 15 minutes from 3:00 to 3:15. Then I had my lunch from—it was<br>
   half an hour by the way—from 4:00 for 4:30. I had my second break until<br>
   9:00 to 9:15, and I didn't like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: When you had your days off, there wasn't a way that they could tell<br>
   you. When you got into the floor, it was like, "Why do you come? You got<br>
   your day today. You're not supposed to come." I was like, "Why don't you<br>
   tell us before?" A day before?” I didn't like that. The payment was weekly.<br>
   It was not that bad, but I didn't like it. That's when I applied here at<br>
   TeleTech. I like it so far. It's good, and the best thing is that I don't<br>
   have credentials, so I'm not working.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: What does that mean?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Yeah. Basically in call centers, you have 60 people, and your max<br>
   is for 70. A new wave comes in, maybe 15 people, and the five people that<br>
   are left—since you already took all of the capacity you're supposed to have<br>
   for agents and the rest of them don't have credentials—don't do anything.<br>
   You don't work. Let's say you don't work. You just wake up to come to work<br>
   and not do anything. That's what not having credentials means.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You're getting paid for nothing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Exactly. I was like, "Okay, I'll take it." Even so, in training, I<br>
   consider myself as one of the best of all my wave, because I have the<br>
   knowledge, and even though I don't do nothing, they ask me, "Hey, how do<br>
   you do this? What's this?" I can tell them. That's not a problem to me. If<br>
   I get my credential today, it's like, "You know what? Yeah. Give me them,<br>
   I'll start working like I'm supposed to be." You go to work to have money.<br>
   That work, if it applies some responsibilities, you have to do them,<br>
   because otherwise, why would you be working? If you don't want to have<br>
   responsibilities, you rather be something else, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: What about socially? Has it been hard to adjust socially, make<br>
   friends, girlfriends?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: No. No. The people I have met, they actually helped me here. They<br>
   helped me study and everything, so that wasn't a problem at all.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: What do you miss most?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: My dad. I miss my dad. Yeah. I miss him. I remember when we used to<br>
   go to field trips, and when he took me to his job, when we went to go watch<br>
   movies, to the parks, and stuff like that. It's not like any more, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Neither of you ?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: We talk through Messenger, WhatsApp, and through phone, right? I<br>
   call him or he calls me, and we keep in touch like that. That's the way we<br>
   can talk with each other, but right now since I don't have a phone, it's a<br>
   little bit harder. If you don't have a phone, you don't have access to<br>
   WhatsApp and Messenger. You have to go to a computer, maybe in your house,<br>
   maybe in the local. Sometimes you don't have that time to actually go<br>
   there, like having your cell phone right on hand. Having mobile data or<br>
   WiFi is very different. You can go on the metro, or go on the metro bus, or<br>
   in a bus, in a car, and still be talking with him. In this case, I have to<br>
   be in a certain spot to actually talk to him. so yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: What are your dreams now, now that you're here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: The most important one is finish high school. After that, I want to<br>
   study software engineer, and I like it a lot. I like it a lot. I want to<br>
   get into a good job. Right now, I have a girlfriend. When I needed it, she<br>
   was there for me. I have a very good relationship with her, and I feel a<br>
   lot of love for her. If things can happen in the future, I'm willing to<br>
   take it. I'd take it. I'll take it because not a lot of girls will help you<br>
   the way she helped me, because most of them are not interested on who you<br>
   are or what you need, and she was in the moment when I needed it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: That's why I feel a lot of love for her. That's a relationship. I<br>
   want to go back to the States, even though I know it's harder, getting a<br>
   job, but I really want to go with my dad, to be with my dad. Yeah. I want<br>
   to be with him, with my brothers. I want to spend more time in my life with<br>
   them. The time I didn't have in the past, I want to have it in the future.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: We're going to stop at this point, but is there anything that you<br>
   would like to say to people about you and your experiences that you haven't<br>
   said yet? Is there anything you want to leave with?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Carlos: Mostly a lot of immigrants don't have where to go or people to care<br>
   them. You know, what I've learned is that there is always a person who can<br>
   take care of you. There's always good people that care for you. You know<br>
   what? After all the problems, everything, I believe in God, I think God<br>
   puts the way, correct way so you can live again, so you will not feel<br>
   depressed. You just got to believe. You got to have faith that everything<br>
   is going to be all right at the end of the day, and that even if you feel<br>
   alone, you're not alone. There's always somebody taking care of you. Even<br>
   though if you don't know them, or you haven't seen them, there's always<br>
   somebody that takes care of you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's great. Thank you so much.<br>
