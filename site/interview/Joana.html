   longer than it was supposed to. Then I just went back. My mom called me.<br>

 <br>
 <br>

I got here with my dad. He is living here in</br>   Mexico City. I stayed for about a year and a half. Then I went back to the</br>   United States.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you left with your‚Äîyou came to Mexico City from where?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: From ___, North Carolina.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.

You were born in Veracuz?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Then, when did you go to the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: When I was about five.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you were five, you went from Veracruz to the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: To the United States, to ___ North Carolina.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: To ____ North Carolina.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Got it. And you went with who?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: With my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: With your mom.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But not with your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where was your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: My dad was in ___, but we didn't have contact. My mom didn't have</br>   contact with him. He never helped me out, so it was basically my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did she choose to go to ____ if she didn't have any relationship</br>   with your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: She was in ____. She was living in ____ (same town).</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you were all alone here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I was with my grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were with your grandma. Okay, now I'm beginning to understand.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you were with your grandma. Both your parents are in ____</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah, at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But they were not together?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: They split up when I was about one.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, but both of them are still living in _____.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Currently?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No, at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Oh, yes. At the time, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. So, your mom says, &quot;Come on over.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Joana: She came to Mexico and she came to pick me up, and I pretty much</br>   traveled with her except when I was going to across the border.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Except when you were crossing the border?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.I was four at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, because basically I didn't know her at all. I grew up with my</br>   grandma. That was my mother figure. So, I didn't really know her at all.</br>   And when I first met her, I didn't even talk to her. I didn't have the</br>   confidence. I didn't, well, like I said, it was like a new person to me</br>   that I didn't know anything about. I hadn't talked to her on the phone</br>   ever, because supposedly when she called, my grandma would say that I was</br>   asleep or I was playing outside or anything else, but that I wasn't there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That was because I stayed with my grandma from my dad's side.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: My dad never called either. He never supported me economically.</br>   Yeah, they actually did have a fight over me, a legal fight, because my</br>   grandma didn't want to let me go, but she was my mother. So, under the law,</br>   I was supposed to be with her. Not with my grandma. Basically, I had to</br>   leave with her, because they couldn't do anything to hold me back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Whoa.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's really difficult for a little girl.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: It's been crazy. Pretty much. I cried. I remember that my mom went</br>   to pick me up and she basically stole me, technically, because I really</br>   didn't know her. I didn't want to leave, but I didn't have another choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you kicking and screaming?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I definitely was. I remember I opened my arms and my legs when</br>   they were trying to force me in the taxi, because I didn't want to leave. I</br>   was crying and yelling and screaming and I couldn't do anything. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did it get better once you got to ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, because I got to know her and, well, she was my mother. I</br>   didn't have any other choice but to get to know her. I mean, it was</br>   difficult because until this day I don't really have a lot of</br>   communications with her. I still don't have that connection. Pretty much,</br>   she spent her time working so we didn't really have time to actually sit</br>   down. She didn't ask, &quot;How are you doing? How is school?&quot; Anything. &quot;Do you</br>   have problems? Are you having trouble?&quot; I mean, nothing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, why did she want to take you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Well, she said that I was her daughter and that she loved me. Well,</br>   she was sending money, she was taking care of me in a way, but I just</br>   wasn't living with her. But it wasn't her choice either, because when she</br>   left, she couldn't take me at that time. She tried to get me with her, and</br>   she actually did. So, it was basically that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think her lack of affection, as you've described it, was</br>   because you didn't spend your first few years together?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I think so. I think that has a lot to do with it, because I kind of</br>   see the way she treats my brother and my sister‚Äîshe had them since they</br>   were born‚Äîevery year, every day, every single minute. With me it wasn't</br>   like that. She already was remarried with my stepdad, of course. It was</br>   really difficult for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I can imagine.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are your sister and your brother children with this stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, they're Americans.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: So, they're, yes, yes. They're both‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you get along with them?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Quite good. I mean, they're my siblings. I cannot stop loving them.</br>   I really can't. Since I got there, my brother was around three, so it was</br>   hard because I didn't know him, but throughout time it got better. The</br>   relationship really got strong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There are two years difference?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah, about two, no, three, four years. Yeah, because he's sixteen</br>   right now. My sister's, she's turning twelve on June 15th.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you're nineteen?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the border crossing difficult? How did you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I don't remember. That's the only thing I don't. I don't know if my</br>   brain blocked it because it was traumatizing. I really have tried to</br>   remember, and I can't. I don't know why, but I really can't. [Chuckles].</br>   It's weird because the thing that I remember is a smell, a certain smell</br>   that when you get a cold and you get sick. It's so distinguishing that if I</br>   smell it, it'll just throw me back. I can't really describe the smell, but</br>   it's just one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were five. You get to the States. You're living with your mom.</br>   Your dad is somewhere in ____, too.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you see him?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. Until I was around seven to eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did he try to look for you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. Well, to my knowledge, no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ask about him?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't really know about him. No one ever told me, &quot;Oh, this is</br>   your dad.&quot; Or someone showed me pictures. My grandma says she did, but I</br>   don't remember. I don't recall.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your stepdad treat you well?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. I actually never had an issue with him, which was the great</br>   thing about it, because other stepdads, or other step parents, might treat</br>   you differently than their kids, or set you aside, or not buy you this, or</br>   if they're going out, leave you at home. He never did anything to make me</br>   feel uncomfortable or that I wasn't his kid. Nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You get to the U.S. and you go to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am. Kindergarten.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like? Do you remember that? When do your memories</br>   start?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: [Chuckles] They do start in kindergarten, but then again, I went</br>   to‚ÄîI don't remember how many schools during elementary. Then in middle</br>   school, my mom really had a struggle settling down, because in ____ there's</br>   some areas where they have a lot of crime. It was kind of rough, but now</br>   she's settled down.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she moved around in ____ all the time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you spent your whole time in elementary school in ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I went to about three schools in elementary and about two in</br>   middle school and then one in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then here, I went to, technically, it's one, but you know how here</br>   in Mexico they have a name in the morning shift and then a name in the</br>   second, the afternoon shift? So, I went to both of them. It was chaos</br>   throughout my whole life. Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No stability at all?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. [Chuckle]. None at all. My life has been all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have friends?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I was actually surprised, because sometimes it's hard. It's</br>   really hard, because they'll look at you and they can tell you're not from</br>   here. It's difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you know that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: When I was small, no. Then when I got older, in my teenage years, I</br>   did have the knowledge, but I was afraid and embarrassed for anyone to find</br>   out. Especially in school [Chuckle]. But I didn't know that education wise,</br>   they don't have a problem with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why were you embarrassed about being undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I was embarrassed about being undocumented because I didn't want to</br>   get bullied. I was so afraid because I have seen cases where kids have been</br>   bullied. My brother was bullied. I didn't want to go through that. I was so</br>   scared, and I didn't want to leave my family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You mean you didn't want to get deported?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah, I didn't want to get deported at all. I don't think anyone</br>   does. No one wants to go through all the process. It's pretty scary.</br>   [Emotional].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was a secret that you kept?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Being undocumented was my darkest secret. I didn't want anyone to</br>   find out. I was terrified. I didn't want to be separated from my family</br>   again, [Emotional] because I didn't grow up with them for about four years.</br>   It was extremely hard. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I can't imagine... I mean, you talk about fear, you talk about being</br>   ashamed, and then there's the issue about having to keep a secret.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Imagine‚Ä¶ I don't think anyone being a citizen has a fear of</br>   anything. They're free to go anywhere they want. They're free to do</br>   whatever they want. They can study all the way to where they want to get,</br>   and we don't. We don't get that opportunity. [Crying]. I don't think anyone</br>   should go through that. It's just, it's not fair. I had dreams when I was a</br>   little kid. I wanted to be someone in life. I wanted to have a career. That</br>   was probably the main reason of why I decided to drop out because I</br>   figured, I mean, I'm not going to get to go to college, I'm not going to</br>   get to have a career here, so why do I even try? They make us feel less,</br>   like we don't matter at all, like our lives are just worthless, and that's</br>   not the case. We contribute to everything. We try to follow the law. Still,</br>   that doesn't count. That doesn't matter at all. It's really, really hard.</br>   It's extremely hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you'd had the chance, what would you have become?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I wanted to be a veterinarian. That was my dream. Or a teacher. I</br>   love kids. I love to teach. I love to help everyone. If I see someone</br>   struggling, I want to help them, and I can't. I felt like I could never do</br>   that. It's really hard seeing how some people don't even value that. A lot</br>   of American citizens don't look at it that way. They really don't care.</br>   They're like, &quot;Oh, well, you're not from here. So, we can't do anything.&quot;</br>   That's just it. That's the reality for a lot, a lot, a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I just want you to know, that's why we're doing this project. So</br>   that your voice gets heard. How did you come back to Mexico? When did you</br>   go back the first time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: The first time it was when I was fourteen, 2014, because I was born</br>   in 2000 so it kind of goes by the year. Like I said, I came back as a</br>   family reunion, but it kind of extended a little.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You came back to visit your family, you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am. I came back to visit my family. Well, my dad, and meet</br>   my little sister. That's why I came, and to visit my grandparents that I</br>   hadn't seen in ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you came back, did you know that you would have to cross the</br>   border again to go back? Were you planning to stay? What were you thinking?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't know I was going to cross again because my mom said that it</br>   might turn into a permanent stay if she didn't figure out a way to get me</br>   back. Well, at the end of the day, she did figure out a way for me to get</br>   back. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long were you here for?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Around a year and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: When I was sixteen in the United States. I was going to high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. Let's go back. A year and a half after, you're fifteen now and</br>   you go back? When did you go back to the United States the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I was turning sixteen, almost.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And here you were going to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you cross the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Basically, with fake documents. That was how because my mom didn't</br>   want me to go through the normal way, I guess, of crossing the border. She</br>   didn't want me to go through that because when I was five, she kind of knew</br>   that my brain was going to block it and I wasn't going to be able to</br>   remember, but when I was fourteen, there's no way for me to not remember</br>   that. So, she tried to get the best thing that she could. She paid a lot of</br>   money for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got somebody's U.S. papers and you crossed by bus?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. That's exactly how.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There was no trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. There wasn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you go back to ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you go back to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Then what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then I dropped out when I was sixteen and I started working.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I dropped out because I had personal issues with my mom and, well,</br>   in my mind, I didn't think there was enough. I mean, even if I finished</br>   high school, I wasn't going to be able to keep on studying what I wanted to</br>   study. I had good grades in school. I mean, at the end of the day, what</br>   does it really mean? If it's not worth anything. I mean, you can do your</br>   best. You can at the top of your class and it still doesn't mean anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you at the top of your class?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: One of them. In certain classes, yes, I was the best. In math class,</br>   in other classes [Chuckle], but in others I was like the second.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you were a really good student?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I always tried my best. Even if I missed a day, I was already</br>   caught up. I always tried. My mom was really proud of me. I remember, she</br>   kept all my diplomas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you proud of you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Of course, because I didn't think I was going to, at least reach</br>   that high. [Emotional]. I mean, I kind of regret not finishing it, but it</br>   wasn't going to help me anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were angry?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. At the laws. They say it's a free country, but it's not free</br>   for us. We got to work every day. You wake up at 6:00 A.M., you get home at</br>   8:00, and it's still the same thing. Every day. No one sees that. No one.</br>   No one pays attention to what we go through. What we struggle. Some</br>   Hispanics really can't afford a lot of things, and no one tries to help</br>   them out. And when they try like right now‚Ä¶. I mean, Donald Trump really</br>   took a lot of things away. A lot of advantages, a lot of help, gone. We</br>   can't get them back. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: We're going to fight. You have some Americans here on your side.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Thank you. It really does mean a lot. It seems like a small help,</br>   but it's a lot because no one has ever came up to me and asked, &quot;How are</br>   you doing? How do think that's going to affect you? What do you think's</br>   going to happen?&quot; No one asks. They're just like, &quot;Oh, well, you don't</br>   belong here. You're not from here. You shouldn't even be here.&quot; That's how</br>   they treat us, and that's reality. You can't say anything back to them</br>   because at the end of the day it's kind of true, but it shouldn't be that</br>   way. They say we have equal rights. I don't see it. [Chuckle]. I really</br>   don't. We're not equal to them. We're not equal, and we work a lot harder.</br>   We really try our best. We try to follow everything step by step at the</br>   foot of everything. That doesn't help us. Some actually do become American</br>   citizens, and every time you see a case like that, it's like, &quot;Wow,</br>   congratulations. You deserve it.&quot; Because who doesn't want to? Who doesn't</br>   want to be treated like an American citizen? We're not treated that way. We</br>   always get discriminated by something, and that's not fair. I don't think</br>   anyone, from any country, from anywhere in the world should ever get</br>   treated that way. I just don't believe it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You're working now?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I'm working.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What jobs did you work in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Oh, in the States? I worked pretty much construction jobs. Framing,</br>   roofing, vinyl, painting. I worked in lawns. I've worked pretty much</br>   construction jobs, yards.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many women were doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Not a lot. My mom does cleaning, that's her job and she loves it. I</br>   love cleaning, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Houses?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. Houses, apartments, she works inside and out. She's pretty</br>   great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Does she have her papers?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No, she doesn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did all this and then how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I got arrested in _____. I moved to ______when I was about</br>   seventeen. I stayed about a year and that's when I.C.E. took me in.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For what?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: It was, I think, an illegal turn, a U-turn. I was driving without a</br>   license because we can't get a license, but yet again, we do have to get to</br>   work. I mean, how are you going to expect anyone to get to work if they</br>   don't have transportation? You have to drive. It's probably the main thing</br>   that, why a lot of people get deported. That and raids.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is this the first time you were stopped just for making an illegal</br>   turn?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's the first thing you did?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. Well I had tickets, but I had never gotten arrested. I pretty</br>   much always paid my tickets.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Then what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: And then, well, I went into custody. They tried to get me out, but</br>   they couldn't. I.C.E. took me in. That's how I got back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For how long?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: For about a month, and I got out pretty quickly because I had my</br>   passport with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just happened to have your passport with you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No, that was the only I.D. I had.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were carrying it with you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I didn't have any American I.D.s. I mean, we can't get them, so</br>   that was the only I.D. I had‚Äîmy passport. That's how they got my</br>   nationality and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were there a lot of other women in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, but not a lot. There were mainly men, mainly. Actually, I had</br>   already gotten stopped, but I was a minor and they hadn't taken any</br>   information on me because I got stopped going to work. It was really early,</br>   and we, the other guys that were with me, were about to leave the apartment</br>   complexes where we used to live. All of a sudden, we just got stopped by</br>   two I.C.E. officers. They never identified themselves. They didn't say why</br>   we got stopped. They pretty much didn't give out any information at all.</br>   They just went in and I.D.-ed them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That was around 2016. In _____.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you go stopped by I.C.E., it was in _____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. The first time it was in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. And in ______?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then the second time it was in 2019.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it was Trump?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, it was Trump, when Trump was already in. Basically, he started</br>   a lot of, he provoked a lot of stops. In ____, everyone's scared until</br>   today, everyone. I see a lot of Hispanics watching out for each other. I've</br>   seen a lot of posts on Facebook saying, &quot;Hey, watch out. There's a...&quot; What</br>   do you...?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Raid.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: &quot;Raid on certain street or on certain highway. Just be careful.&quot;</br>   Everyone's always trying to help each other out.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. You know, we've been trying to do the same work in the U.S.</br>   and we can't because people are too afraid to talk to us.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I know. Everyone thinks they're going to get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That's basically what everyone's scared of because they don't want</br>   to lose the opportunity, because going to Mexico and the United States</br>   there's not even a comparison.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean by that?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Here, for example, if someone rapes you and you go to a police</br>   officer, sometimes they really won't help you. There's a lot of corruption</br>   that's mainly everywhere, from the president down. Everyone. It's pretty</br>   weird because the cartels, they're actually the ones that actually help</br>   their states out. They actually offer jobs and the president doesn't. It's</br>   like, why? But, it's just the way it is. You're actually scared to actually</br>   go up to a police officer because you know that if you get stopped, they're</br>   not going to read you the laws. They're going to ask you for money. You're</br>   not going to see a U.S. officer do that, ever. They're going to arrest you</br>   on the spot. Here, they don't do that. That's how Mexico is.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel American or Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: More American because I grew up in America.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does it mean, being American?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: There's a lot... Being American, to me, it means you can do, you can</br>   be free. You can live your life like you want to. That doesn't mean you're</br>   going to break the laws. That doesn't mean you're going to commit an</br>   offense, but it means that you can actually live freely and without the</br>   worry that you're going to get deported anytime. I don't think that's</br>   living because you're always afraid. You're always afraid of anyone and</br>   everyone. You never know when that person's going to stab you in the back</br>   and call I.C.E. on you. That's what everyone's afraid of. Everyone doesn't</br>   want to say that they're undocumented. No one wants to admit it because</br>   everyone's scared. You don't get the same rights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you say you feel more American than Mexican, what does that</br>   mean to you to feel it? I mean, I know that you're not an American citizen.</br>   What does it feel culturally or whatever way? In what way do you feel</br>   American?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I guess in every way. There's a lot more connection to me with an</br>   American citizen than there is with a Mexican citizen. The cultures,</br>   they're so different. I mean, pizza isn't really even pizza here to be</br>   honest. A hamburger isn't a hamburger. It's an American dish. In Mexico</br>   they have other foods. They have other cultures. They have a variety of</br>   things. Being American, to me, it feels like I can go travel. I don't even</br>   know how to explain it. I just don't know how to put it. I guess, it means</br>   to me, it feels like... I really, I don't have the words right now. I guess</br>   it would feel... I don't, I can't find the words.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It doesn't matter. I have two more questions for you. What are your</br>   hopes and dreams now that you're back in Mexico? What do you want to do</br>   with your life?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I want to have a career. Now that I can, that I actually have the</br>   opportunity. Because in the United States, it was just like, &quot;Why do I even</br>   try? Why do I even bother? I mean, at the end of the day, I'm not going to</br>   actually be what I want.&quot; The thing is, the education, it's really high in</br>   the United States; it's way better than here in Mexico. Here in Mexico it's</br>   just like, &quot;Oh, well, you've got to learn this. You've got to learn that.&quot;</br>   I mean, I feel like I would have a lot of trouble here because I mainly</br>   will understand more in English than Spanish. So, if they're talking about</br>   laws or they're talking about this or that, I kind of get a lot confused.</br>   Not a little bit, a lot. It's like, &quot;Oh my God.‚Äù I don't even understand</br>   what they're saying. I don't get a lot of professional terms. I don't</br>   understand them at all. My co-workers, if I don't understand something in</br>   Spanish, they'll be like, &quot;Oh, it's this.&quot; It's like, &quot;Oh, okay, okay. I</br>   get it now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where are you working now?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: At T-Tech.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: T-Tech.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of career are you going to have here?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Well, since T-Tech does offer, after three months of being with</br>   them, to continue studying and working for obviously much more economical</br>   payment‚Äîit has to be related to what I'm working on. So, I might go into</br>   business or I'm still not sure.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you won't be a veterinarian?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Not anymore. [Chuckles]. Once I get a career and I start‚Äîbecause</br>   right now we're in training‚Äîonce the three months are over, I want to save</br>   up at least half of my money and actually donate to a shelter for mainly</br>   dogs because here in Mexico there's a lot of dogs on the streets. A lot,</br>   like a lot. Apparently, they don't help them. There's actually a lot of‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They don‚Äôt help people‚Ä¶</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Exactly. If they don't help us, they're not going to help an</br>   innocent animal. They'll kill them. Even if you get into an accident or</br>   they run you over, they'll go back and run you over until pretty much</br>   you're dead just because they don't want to pay your hospitality in the</br>   hospital. They don't want to pay it. They'll be like, &quot;Oh, she died. Might</br>   as well pay that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I have two more questions for you. One is to go back to the States</br>   for one second. What we've noticed are some young women, who live through</br>   the horror of being undocumented and parents who are absent become teen</br>   mothers. Why does that happen and did this happen to you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. This didn't happen to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Explain this to me.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="7d051991-59cd-47e7-b4c0-b4490a2d820c" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife">Joana: I believe it didn't happen to me just because my mom did have me at<br>
   a young age. She had me when she was fifteen. So, I didn't want to go<br>
   through that. I didn't want to not have the experience of going to school<br>
   and having friends and going out and actually enjoying my life as a<br>
   teenager and just moving straight to having a kid‚Äîbeing responsible and<br>
   taking care of him and working and still having to pay day care and<br>
   everything. I didn't want to go through that. I didn't think I was fit<br>
   enough, I guess. I mean, you're young. I know you learn things, and there's<br>
   no book that just states it there that you have to do this, and you have to<br>
   do that. No. You kind of have to experience things to learn from them. I<br>
   don't think I wanted to go through that. I believe a lot of young girls go<br>
   through it because sometimes, especially, I guess, Hispanics, they have to<br>
   work to maintain everything‚Äîhome, kids, everything, cars. So, pretty much,<br>
   they get left alone and they're not taken care of so they have a lot of<br>
   liberty. I think that's why.<br>

   innocent animal. They'll kill them. Even if you get into an accident or<br>
   they run you over, they'll go back and run you over until pretty much<br>
   you're dead just because they don't want to pay your hospitality in the<br>

[Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you were with your grandma.

At the time, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. So, your mom says, &quot;Come on over.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Joana: She came to Mexico and she came to pick me up, and I pretty much</br>   traveled with her except when I was going to across the border.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Except when you were crossing the border?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.I was four at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, because basically I didn't know her at all. I grew up with my</br>   grandma. That was my mother figure. So, I didn't really know her at all.</br>   And when I first met her, I didn't even talk to her. I didn't have the</br>   confidence. I didn't, well, like I said, it was like a new person to me</br>   that I didn't know anything about. I hadn't talked to her on the phone</br>   ever, because supposedly when she called, my grandma would say that I was</br>   asleep or I was playing outside or anything else, but that I wasn't there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That was because I stayed with my grandma from my dad's side.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: My dad never called either. He never supported me economically.</br>   Yeah, they actually did have a fight over me, a legal fight, because my</br>   grandma didn't want to let me go, but she was my mother. So, under the law,</br>   I was supposed to be with her. Not with my grandma. Basically, I had to</br>   leave with her, because they couldn't do anything to hold me back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Whoa.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's really difficult for a little girl.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: It's been crazy. Pretty much. I cried. I remember that my mom went</br>   to pick me up and she basically stole me, technically, because I really</br>   didn't know her. I didn't want to leave, but I didn't have another choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you kicking and screaming?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I definitely was. I remember I opened my arms and my legs when</br>   they were trying to force me in the taxi, because I didn't want to leave. I</br>   was crying and yelling and screaming and I couldn't do anything. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did it get better once you got to ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, because I got to know her and, well, she was my mother. I</br>   didn't have any other choice but to get to know her. I mean, it was</br>   difficult because until this day I don't really have a lot of</br>   communications with her. I still don't have that connection. Pretty much,</br>   she spent her time working so we didn't really have time to actually sit</br>   down. She didn't ask, &quot;How are you doing? How is school?&quot; Anything. &quot;Do you</br>   have problems? Are you having trouble?&quot; I mean, nothing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, why did she want to take you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Well, she said that I was her daughter and that she loved me. Well,</br>   she was sending money, she was taking care of me in a way, but I just</br>   wasn't living with her. But it wasn't her choice either, because when she</br>   left, she couldn't take me at that time. She tried to get me with her, and</br>   she actually did. So, it was basically that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think her lack of affection, as you've described it, was</br>   because you didn't spend your first few years together?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I think so. I think that has a lot to do with it, because I kind of</br>   see the way she treats my brother and my sister‚Äîshe had them since they</br>   were born‚Äîevery year, every day, every single minute. With me it wasn't</br>   like that. She already was remarried with my stepdad, of course. It was</br>   really difficult for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I can imagine.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are your sister and your brother children with this stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, they're Americans.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: So, they're, yes, yes. They're both‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you get along with them?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Quite good. I mean, they're my siblings. I cannot stop loving them.</br>   I really can't. Since I got there, my brother was around three, so it was</br>   hard because I didn't know him, but throughout time it got better. The</br>   relationship really got strong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There are two years difference?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah, about two, no, three, four years. Yeah, because he's sixteen</br>   right now. My sister's, she's turning twelve on June 15th.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you're nineteen?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the border crossing difficult? How did you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I don't remember. That's the only thing I don't. I don't know if my</br>   brain blocked it because it was traumatizing. I really have tried to</br>   remember, and I can't. I don't know why, but I really can't. [Chuckles].</br>   It's weird because the thing that I remember is a smell, a certain smell</br>   that when you get a cold and you get sick.

You get to the States. You're living with your mom.</br>   Your dad is somewhere in ____, too.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you see him?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. Until I was around seven to eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did he try to look for you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. Well, to my knowledge, no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ask about him?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't really know about him. No one ever told me, &quot;Oh, this is</br>   your dad.&quot; Or someone showed me pictures. My grandma says she did, but I</br>   don't remember. I don't recall.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your stepdad treat you well?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. I actually never had an issue with him, which was the great</br>   thing about it, because other stepdads, or other step parents, might treat</br>   you differently than their kids, or set you aside, or not buy you this, or</br>   if they're going out, leave you at home. He never did anything to make me</br>   feel uncomfortable or that I wasn't his kid. Nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You get to the U.S. and you go to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am. Kindergarten.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like? Do you remember that? When do your memories</br>   start?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: [Chuckles] They do start in kindergarten, but then again, I went</br>   to‚ÄîI don't remember how many schools during elementary. Then in middle</br>   school, my mom really had a struggle settling down, because in ____ there's</br>   some areas where they have a lot of crime. It was kind of rough, but now</br>   she's settled down.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she moved around in ____ all the time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you spent your whole time in elementary school in ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I went to about three schools in elementary and about two in</br>   middle school and then one in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then here, I went to, technically, it's one, but you know how here</br>   in Mexico they have a name in the morning shift and then a name in the</br>   second, the afternoon shift? So, I went to both of them. It was chaos</br>   throughout my whole life. Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No stability at all?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. [Chuckle]. None at all. My life has been all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have friends?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I was actually surprised, because sometimes it's hard. It's</br>   really hard, because they'll look at you and they can tell you're not from</br>   here. It's difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you know that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: When I was small, no. Then when I got older, in my teenage years, I</br>   did have the knowledge, but I was afraid and embarrassed for anyone to find</br>   out. Especially in school [Chuckle]. But I didn't know that education wise,</br>   they don't have a problem with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why were you embarrassed about being undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I was embarrassed about being undocumented because I didn't want to</br>   get bullied. I was so afraid because I have seen cases where kids have been</br>   bullied. My brother was bullied. I didn't want to go through that. I was so</br>   scared, and I didn't want to leave my family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You mean you didn't want to get deported?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah, I didn't want to get deported at all. I don't think anyone</br>   does. No one wants to go through all the process. It's pretty scary.</br>   [Emotional].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was a secret that you kept?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Being undocumented was my darkest secret. I didn't want anyone to</br>   find out. I was terrified. I didn't want to be separated from my family</br>   again, [Emotional] because I didn't grow up with them for about four years.</br>   It was extremely hard. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I can't imagine... I mean, you talk about fear, you talk about being</br>   ashamed, and then there's the issue about having to keep a secret.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Imagine‚Ä¶ I don't think anyone being a citizen has a fear of</br>   anything. They're free to go anywhere they want. They're free to do</br>   whatever they want. They can study all the way to where they want to get,</br>   and we don't. We don't get that opportunity. [Crying]. I don't think anyone</br>   should go through that. It's just, it's not fair. I had dreams when I was a</br>   little kid. I wanted to be someone in life. I wanted to have a career. That</br>   was probably the main reason of why I decided to drop out because I</br>   figured, I mean, I'm not going to get to go to college, I'm not going to</br>   get to have a career here, so why do I even try? They make us feel less,</br>   like we don't matter at all, like our lives are just worthless, and that's</br>   not the case. We contribute to everything. We try to follow the law. Still,</br>   that doesn't count. That doesn't matter at all. It's really, really hard.</br>   It's extremely hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you'd had the chance, what would you have become?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I wanted to be a veterinarian. That was my dream. Or a teacher. I</br>   love kids. I love to teach. I love to help everyone. If I see someone</br>   struggling, I want to help them, and I can't. I felt like I could never do</br>   that. It's really hard seeing how some people don't even value that. A lot</br>   of American citizens don't look at it that way. They really don't care.</br>   They're like, &quot;Oh, well, you're not from here. So, we can't do anything.&quot;</br>   That's just it. That's the reality for a lot, a lot, a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I just want you to know, that's why we're doing this project. So</br>   that your voice gets heard. How did you come back to Mexico? When did you</br>   go back the first time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: The first time it was when I was fourteen, 2014, because I was born</br>   in 2000 so it kind of goes by the year. Like I said, I came back as a</br>   family reunion, but it kind of extended a little.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You came back to visit your family, you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am. I came back to visit my family. Well, my dad, and meet</br>   my little sister. That's why I came, and to visit my grandparents that I</br>   hadn't seen in ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you came back, did you know that you would have to cross the</br>   border again to go back? Were you planning to stay? What were you thinking?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't know I was going to cross again because my mom said that it</br>   might turn into a permanent stay if she didn't figure out a way to get me</br>   back. Well, at the end of the day, she did figure out a way for me to get</br>   back. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long were you here for?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Around a year and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: When I was sixteen in the United States. I was going to high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. Let's go back. A year and a half after, you're fifteen now and</br>   you go back? When did you go back to the United States the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I was turning sixteen, almost.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And here you were going to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you cross the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Basically, with fake documents. That was how because my mom didn't</br>   want me to go through the normal way, I guess, of crossing the border. She</br>   didn't want me to go through that because when I was five, she kind of knew</br>   that my brain was going to block it and I wasn't going to be able to</br>   remember, but when I was fourteen, there's no way for me to not remember</br>   that. So, she tried to get the best thing that she could. She paid a lot of</br>   money for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got somebody's U.S. papers and you crossed by bus?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. That's exactly how.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There was no trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. There wasn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you go back to ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you go back to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Then what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then I dropped out when I was sixteen and I started working.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I dropped out because I had personal issues with my mom and, well,</br>   in my mind, I didn't think there was enough. I mean, even if I finished</br>   high school, I wasn't going to be able to keep on studying what I wanted to</br>   study. I had good grades in school. I mean, at the end of the day, what</br>   does it really mean? If it's not worth anything. I mean, you can do your</br>   best. You can at the top of your class and it still doesn't mean anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you at the top of your class?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: One of them. In certain classes, yes, I was the best. In math class,</br>   in other classes [Chuckle], but in others I was like the second.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you were a really good student?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I always tried my best. Even if I missed a day, I was already</br>   caught up. I always tried. My mom was really proud of me. I remember, she</br>   kept all my diplomas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you proud of you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Of course, because I didn't think I was going to, at least reach</br>   that high. [Emotional]. I mean, I kind of regret not finishing it, but it</br>   wasn't going to help me anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were angry?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. At the laws. They say it's a free country, but it's not free</br>   for us. We got to work every day. You wake up at 6:00 A.M., you get home at</br>   8:00, and it's still the same thing. Every day. No one sees that. No one.</br>   No one pays attention to what we go through. What we struggle. Some</br>   Hispanics really can't afford a lot of things, and no one tries to help</br>   them out. And when they try like right now‚Ä¶. I mean, Donald Trump really</br>   took a lot of things away. A lot of advantages, a lot of help, gone. We</br>   can't get them back. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: We're going to fight. You have some Americans here on your side.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Thank you. It really does mean a lot. It seems like a small help,</br>   but it's a lot because no one has ever came up to me and asked, &quot;How are</br>   you doing? How do think that's going to affect you? What do you think's</br>   going to happen?&quot; No one asks. They're just like, &quot;Oh, well, you don't</br>   belong here. You're not from here. You shouldn't even be here.&quot; That's how</br>   they treat us, and that's reality. You can't say anything back to them</br>   because at the end of the day it's kind of true, but it shouldn't be that</br>   way. They say we have equal rights. I don't see it. [Chuckle]. I really</br>   don't. We're not equal to them. We're not equal, and we work a lot harder.</br>   We really try our best. We try to follow everything step by step at the</br>   foot of everything. That doesn't help us. Some actually do become American</br>   citizens, and every time you see a case like that, it's like, &quot;Wow,</br>   congratulations. You deserve it.&quot; Because who doesn't want to? Who doesn't</br>   want to be treated like an American citizen? We're not treated that way. We</br>   always get discriminated by something, and that's not fair. I don't think</br>   anyone, from any country, from anywhere in the world should ever get</br>   treated that way. I just don't believe it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You're working now?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I'm working.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What jobs did you work in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Oh, in the States? I worked pretty much construction jobs. Framing,</br>   roofing, vinyl, painting. I worked in lawns. I've worked pretty much</br>   construction jobs, yards.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many women were doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Not a lot. My mom does cleaning, that's her job and she loves it. I</br>   love cleaning, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Houses?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. Houses, apartments, she works inside and out. She's pretty</br>   great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Does she have her papers?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No, she doesn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did all this and then how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I got arrested in _____. I moved to ______when I was about</br>   seventeen. I stayed about a year and that's when I.C.E. took me in.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For what?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: It was, I think, an illegal turn, a U-turn. I was driving without a</br>   license because we can't get a license, but yet again, we do have to get to</br>   work. I mean, how are you going to expect anyone to get to work if they</br>   don't have transportation? You have to drive. It's probably the main thing</br>   that, why a lot of people get deported. That and raids.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is this the first time you were stopped just for making an illegal</br>   turn?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's the first thing you did?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. Well I had tickets, but I had never gotten arrested. I pretty</br>   much always paid my tickets.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Then what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: And then, well, I went into custody. They tried to get me out, but</br>   they couldn't. I.C.E. took me in. That's how I got back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For how long?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: For about a month, and I got out pretty quickly because I had my</br>   passport with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just happened to have your passport with you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No, that was the only I.D. I had.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were carrying it with you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I didn't have any American I.D.s. I mean, we can't get them, so</br>   that was the only I.D. I had‚Äîmy passport. That's how they got my</br>   nationality and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were there a lot of other women in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, but not a lot. There were mainly men, mainly. Actually, I had</br>   already gotten stopped, but I was a minor and they hadn't taken any</br>   information on me because I got stopped going to work. It was really early,</br>   and we, the other guys that were with me, were about to leave the apartment</br>   complexes where we used to live. All of a sudden, we just got stopped by</br>   two I.C.E. officers. They never identified themselves. They didn't say why</br>   we got stopped. They pretty much didn't give out any information at all.</br>   They just went in and I.D.-ed them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That was around 2016. In _____.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you go stopped by I.C.E., it was in _____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. The first time it was in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. And in ______?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then the second time it was in 2019.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it was Trump?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, it was Trump, when Trump was already in. Basically, he started</br>   a lot of, he provoked a lot of stops. In ____, everyone's scared until</br>   today, everyone. I see a lot of Hispanics watching out for each other. I've</br>   seen a lot of posts on Facebook saying, &quot;Hey, watch out. There's a...&quot; What</br>   do you...?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Raid.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: &quot;Raid on certain street or on certain highway. Just be careful.&quot;</br>   Everyone's always trying to help each other out.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. You know, we've been trying to do the same work in the U.S.</br>   and we can't because people are too afraid to talk to us.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I know. Everyone thinks they're going to get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That's basically what everyone's scared of because they don't want</br>   to lose the opportunity, because going to Mexico and the United States</br>   there's not even a comparison.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean by that?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Here, for example, if someone rapes you and you go to a police</br>   officer, sometimes they really won't help you. There's a lot of corruption</br>   that's mainly everywhere, from the president down. Everyone. It's pretty</br>   weird because the cartels, they're actually the ones that actually help</br>   their states out. They actually offer jobs and the president doesn't. It's</br>   like, why? But, it's just the way it is. You're actually scared to actually</br>   go up to a police officer because you know that if you get stopped, they're</br>   not going to read you the laws. They're going to ask you for money. You're</br>   not going to see a U.S. officer do that, ever. They're going to arrest you</br>   on the spot. Here, they don't do that. That's how Mexico is.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel American or Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: More American because I grew up in America.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does it mean, being American?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: There's a lot... Being American, to me, it means you can do, you can</br>   be free. You can live your life like you want to. That doesn't mean you're</br>   going to break the laws. That doesn't mean you're going to commit an</br>   offense, but it means that you can actually live freely and without the</br>   worry that you're going to get deported anytime. I don't think that's</br>   living because you're always afraid. You're always afraid of anyone and</br>   everyone. You never know when that person's going to stab you in the back</br>   and call I.C.E. on you. That's what everyone's afraid of. Everyone doesn't</br>   want to say that they're undocumented. No one wants to admit it because</br>   everyone's scared. You don't get the same rights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you say you feel more American than Mexican, what does that</br>   mean to you to feel it? I mean, I know that you're not an American citizen.</br>   What does it feel culturally or whatever way? In what way do you feel</br>   American?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I guess in every way. There's a lot more connection to me with an</br>   American citizen than there is with a Mexican citizen. The cultures,</br>   they're so different. I mean, pizza isn't really even pizza here to be</br>   honest. A hamburger isn't a hamburger. It's an American dish. In Mexico</br>   they have other foods. They have other cultures. They have a variety of</br>   things. Being American, to me, it feels like I can go travel. I don't even</br>   know how to explain it. I just don't know how to put it. I guess, it means</br>   to me, it feels like... I really, I don't have the words right now. I guess</br>   it would feel... I don't, I can't find the words.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It doesn't matter. I have two more questions for you. What are your</br>   hopes and dreams now that you're back in Mexico? What do you want to do</br>   with your life?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I want to have a career. Now that I can, that I actually have the</br>   opportunity. Because in the United States, it was just like, &quot;Why do I even</br>   try? Why do I even bother? I mean, at the end of the day, I'm not going to</br>   actually be what I want.&quot; The thing is, the education, it's really high in</br>   the United States; it's way better than here in Mexico. Here in Mexico it's</br>   just like, &quot;Oh, well, you've got to learn this. You've got to learn that.&quot;</br>   I mean, I feel like I would have a lot of trouble here because I mainly</br>   will understand more in English than Spanish. So, if they're talking about</br>   laws or they're talking about this or that, I kind of get a lot confused.</br>   Not a little bit, a lot. It's like, &quot;Oh my God.‚Äù I don't even understand</br>   what they're saying. I don't get a lot of professional terms. I don't</br>   understand them at all. My co-workers, if I don't understand something in</br>   Spanish, they'll be like, &quot;Oh, it's this.&quot; It's like, &quot;Oh, okay, okay. I</br>   get it now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where are you working now?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: At T-Tech.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: T-Tech.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of career are you going to have here?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Well, since T-Tech does offer, after three months of being with</br>   them, to continue studying and working for obviously much more economical</br>   payment‚Äîit has to be related to what I'm working on. So, I might go into</br>   business or I'm still not sure.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you won't be a veterinarian?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Not anymore. [Chuckles]. Once I get a career and I start‚Äîbecause</br>   right now we're in training‚Äîonce the three months are over, I want to save</br>   up at least half of my money and actually donate to a shelter for mainly</br>   dogs because here in Mexico there's a lot of dogs on the streets. A lot,</br>   like a lot. Apparently, they don't help them. There's actually a lot of‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They don‚Äôt help people‚Ä¶</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Exactly. If they don't help us, they're not going to help an</br>   innocent animal. They'll kill them. Even if you get into an accident or</br>   they run you over, they'll go back and run you over until pretty much</br>   you're dead just because they don't want to pay your hospitality in the</br>   hospital. They don't want to pay it. They'll be like, &quot;Oh, she died. Might</br>   as well pay that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I have two more questions for you. One is to go back to the States</br>   for one second. What we've noticed are some young women, who live through</br>   the horror of being undocumented and parents who are absent become teen</br>   mothers. Why does that happen and did this happen to you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. This didn't happen to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Explain this to me.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I believe it didn't happen to me just because my mom did have me at</br>   a young age. She had me when she was fifteen. So, I didn't want to go</br>   through that. I didn't want to not have the experience of going to school</br>   and having friends and going out and actually enjoying my life as a</br>   teenager and just moving straight to having a kid‚Äîbeing responsible and</br>   taking care of him and working and still having to pay day care and</br>   everything. I didn't want to go through that. I didn't think I was fit</br>   enough, I guess. I mean, you're young. I know you learn things, and there's</br>   no book that just states it there that you have to do this, and you have to</br>   do that. No. You kind of have to experience things to learn from them. I</br>   don't think I wanted to go through that. I believe a lot of young girls go</br>   through it because sometimes, especially, I guess, Hispanics, they have to</br>   work to maintain everything‚Äîhome, kids, everything, cars. So, pretty much,</br>   they get left alone and they're not taken care of so they have a lot of</br>   liberty. I think that's why.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever want to be part of the streets or a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why not?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I saw a lot of things that could happen to you. You could get raped</br>   by all of them. Nobody wants to go through that, or nobody wants to get</br>   beat up to join a gang. Why even go through the struggle? I don't find it</br>   logical to be honest. I mean, I don't want to go through suffering to be in</br>   a gang to make other people suffer. I really don't get it. I mean, you</br>   could work to get money. Why do you have to rob someone? Why do you have to</br>   beat someone up? Why do you have to stab them and shoot them?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that's just because that's the way your mind was wired?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. That's the way I saw things.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because your mother wasn't present.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was just you.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: But she did give me advice, but it wasn't a huge conversation that</br>   we had. Just every time that maybe I did something wrong, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Don't do this because this could happen.&quot; Or, &quot;Do this instead.&quot; Or,</br>   &quot;Don't do something good that seems bad because that could affect you.&quot; I</br>   think that was what formed my mind.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something that we're thinking about and we want to write about is</br>   what the U.S. loses by deporting people and what Mexico actually gains by</br>   receiving people like you. Let me ask you that. What does the U.S. lose by</br>   deporting people like Joana?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Well, they lose mainly trust because you don't trust anyone. You're</br>   always afraid. We live in fear. You don't trust anyone. What they lose is</br>   workers. We pay taxes. They lose, maybe, ties to certain things in Mexico</br>   because they do have to export, import. If this keeps going on, at the end</br>   of the day, they're going to stop because Donald Trump doesn't apparently</br>   want us in the United States, so why does Mexico have to give them anything</br>   that's Mexican? I mean, Mexico is a country where they do have a lot of</br>   oil, they have coffee, what don't they have? I mean, we have a lot of</br>   tourists that come to Mexico. Trump has towers here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does Mexico gain by you guys coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I think, I'm not sure‚Äî[Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what do you think? What do you have to give to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Maybe, because a lot people think of investing in the United States,</br>   so once they leave, they're going to invest in Mexico. I think a lot of</br>   investments.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As a person, what do you bring?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Your freedom, you gain your freedom to be honest. You're not afraid</br>   here. You're not afraid of anyone coming up to you and saying, &quot;Oh, you're</br>   a wetback. Oh, you don't belong here.&quot; Because this is your country. I</br>   think, as a person, you gain calmness. You don't have to be afraid anymore,</br>   but then again, you kind of don't want to be in Mexico because of all the</br>   corruption.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could help change that corruption in Mexico because</br>   of your experience growing up in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I think if we all join forces, we could change everything. It's only</br>   if you put your mind to it. You can change a lot of things. It's not going</br>   to take a day, but eventually it will happen. If all of us join together</br>   and work together, we can change a lot of things in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think the deported migrants, if you all join together you can</br>   change something?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Definitely. There's a lot of people here that got deported. A lot.</br>   Day after day it's the same thing. Pretty much the same reasons. Either</br>   they got stopped at work, a raid, you name it, but it's pretty much the</br>   same reasons that we come back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you have anything else you want to say? You've told me so much.</br>   I'm so appreciative.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="7578f890-362f-4a65-95dd-d1cc22d6307b" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Feelings, Frustration, Isolation, Sadness, Illness">Joana: No, I don't think there is. I think I've said enough. I don't think<br>
   anyone should go through that. It's pain, it's painful. You don't know how<br>
   many nights I've fallen asleep crying just thinking about everything that<br>
   someone could say to you or things that they have said to me. You don't<br>
   know how much your words can hurt a person. How much just a simple word<br>
   could end their life. A lot of people have committed suicide because of<br>
   that, because they couldn't bear with everything that's going on. A lot of<br>
   people have lost their lives. I don't think it's fair. No one should have<br>
   to be afraid of going outside or going to work. You're just going to work.<br>
   You're not doing anything bad. You're not going against the law. I mean,<br>
   you're working. You're trying. As a student, you try every day. Other kids<br>
   do bully you if they find out that you're not a U.S. citizen. They'll call<br>
   you names. They'll pick on you. Some have been kicked, punched, etc. That's<br>
   not what a kid should go through, especially not if you're really young. A<br>
   lot of five-year-olds go through that. Imagine a kid going through that. An<br>
   innocent child that shouldn't be put through that.<br>

   oil, they have coffee, what don't they have? I mean, we have a lot of<br>
   tourists that come to Mexico. Trump has towers here.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: I didn't want to.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why not?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: I saw a lot of things that could happen to you. You could get raped<br>
   by all of them. Nobody wants to go through that, or nobody wants to get<br>
   beat up to join a gang. Why even go through the struggle? I don't find it<br>
   logical to be honest. I mean, I don't want to go through suffering to be in<br>
   a gang to make other people suffer. I really don't get it. I mean, you<br>
   could work to get money. Why do you have to rob someone? Why do you have to<br>
   beat someone up? Why do you have to stab them and shoot them?<br>

   opportunity. Because in the United States, it was just like, &quot;Why do I even<br>
   try? Why do I even bother? I mean, at the end of the day, I'm not going to<br>
   actually be what I want.&quot; The thing is, the education, it's really high in<br>
   the United States; it's way better than here in Mexico. Here in Mexico it's<br>
   just like, &quot;Oh, well, you've got to learn this. You've got to learn that.&quot;<br>
   I mean, I feel like I would have a lot of trouble here because I mainly<br>
   will understand more in English than Spanish. So, if they're talking about<br>
   laws or they're talking about this or that, I kind of get a lot confused.<br>
   Not a little bit, a lot. It's like, &quot;Oh my God.‚Äù I don't even understand<br>
   what they're saying. I don't get a lot of professional terms. I don't<br>
   understand them at all. My co-workers, if I don't understand something in<br>
   Spanish, they'll be like, &quot;Oh, it's this.&quot; It's like, &quot;Oh, okay, okay. I<br>
   get it now.&quot;<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: More American because I grew up in America.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What does it mean, being American?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: There's a lot... Being American, to me, it means you can do, you can<br>
   be free. You can live your life like you want to. That doesn't mean you're<br>
   going to break the laws. That doesn't mean you're going to commit an<br>
   offense, but it means that you can actually live freely and without the<br>
   worry that you're going to get deported anytime. I don't think that's<br>
   living because you're always afraid. You're always afraid of anyone and<br>
   everyone. You never know when that person's going to stab you in the back<br>
   and call I.C.E. on you. That's what everyone's afraid of. Everyone doesn't<br>
   want to say that they're undocumented. No one wants to admit it because<br>
   everyone's scared. You don't get the same rights.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: When you say you feel more American than Mexican, what does that<br>
   mean to you to feel it? I mean, I know that you're not an American citizen.<br>
   What does it feel culturally or whatever way? In what way do you feel<br>
   American?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: I guess in every way. There's a lot more connection to me with an<br>
   American citizen than there is with a Mexican citizen. The cultures,<br>
   they're so different. I mean, pizza isn't really even pizza here to be<br>
   honest. A hamburger isn't a hamburger. It's an American dish. In Mexico<br>
   they have other foods. They have other cultures. They have a variety of<br>
   things. Being American, to me, it feels like I can go travel. I don't even<br>
   know how to explain it. I just don't know how to put it. I guess, it means<br>
   to me, it feels like... I really, I don't have the words right now. I guess<br>
   it would feel... I don't, I can't find the words.<br>

   officer, sometimes they really won't help you. There's a lot of corruption<br>
   that's mainly everywhere, from the president down. Everyone. It's pretty<br>
   weird because the cartels, they're actually the ones that actually help<br>
   their states out. They actually offer jobs and the president doesn't. It's<br>
   like, why? But, it's just the way it is. You're actually scared to actually<br>
   go up to a police officer because you know that if you get stopped, they're<br>
   not going to read you the laws. They're going to ask you for money. You're<br>
   not going to see a U.S. officer do that, ever. They're going to arrest you<br>
   on the spot. Here, they don't do that. That's how Mexico is.<br>

 <br>
   Joana: Yes.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Yes, but not a lot. There were mainly men, mainly. Actually, I had<br>
   already gotten stopped, but I was a minor and they hadn't taken any<br>
   information on me because I got stopped going to work. It was really early,<br>
   and we, the other guys that were with me, were about to leave the apartment<br>
   complexes where we used to live. All of a sudden, we just got stopped by<br>
   two I.C.E. officers. They never identified themselves. They didn't say why<br>
   we got stopped. They pretty much didn't give out any information at all.<br>
   They just went in and I.D.-ed them.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: It was, I think, an illegal turn, a U-turn. I was driving without a<br>
   license because we can't get a license, but yet again, we do have to get to<br>
   work. I mean, how are you going to expect anyone to get to work if they<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Yes.I was four at that time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was it hard to leave?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Yes, because basically I didn't know her at all. I grew up with my<br>
   grandma. That was my mother figure. So, I didn't really know her at all.<br>
   And when I first met her, I didn't even talk to her. I didn't have the<br>
   confidence. I didn't, well, like I said, it was like a new person to me<br>
   that I didn't know anything about. I hadn't talked to her on the phone<br>
   ever, because supposedly when she called, my grandma would say that I was<br>
   asleep or I was playing outside or anything else, but that I wasn't there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: That was because I stayed with my grandma from my dad's side.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Wow.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: My dad never called either. He never supported me economically.<br>
   Yeah, they actually did have a fight over me, a legal fight, because my<br>
   grandma didn't want to let me go, but she was my mother. So, under the law,<br>
   I was supposed to be with her. Not with my grandma. Basically, I had to<br>
   leave with her, because they couldn't do anything to hold me back.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Whoa.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's really difficult for a little girl.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: It's been crazy. Pretty much. I cried. I remember that my mom went</br>   to pick me up and she basically stole me, technically, because I really</br>   didn't know her. I didn't want to leave, but I didn't have another choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you kicking and screaming?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I definitely was. I remember I opened my arms and my legs when</br>   they were trying to force me in the taxi, because I didn't want to leave. I</br>   was crying and yelling and screaming and I couldn't do anything. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did it get better once you got to ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, because I got to know her and, well, she was my mother. I</br>   didn't have any other choice but to get to know her. I mean, it was</br>   difficult because until this day I don't really have a lot of</br>   communications with her. I still don't have that connection. Pretty much,</br>   she spent her time working so we didn't really have time to actually sit</br>   down. She didn't ask, &quot;How are you doing? How is school?&quot; Anything. &quot;Do you</br>   have problems? Are you having trouble?&quot; I mean, nothing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, why did she want to take you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Well, she said that I was her daughter and that she loved me. Well,</br>   she was sending money, she was taking care of me in a way, but I just</br>   wasn't living with her. But it wasn't her choice either, because when she</br>   left, she couldn't take me at that time. She tried to get me with her, and</br>   she actually did. So, it was basically that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think her lack of affection, as you've described it, was</br>   because you didn't spend your first few years together?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I think so. I think that has a lot to do with it, because I kind of</br>   see the way she treats my brother and my sister‚Äîshe had them since they</br>   were born‚Äîevery year, every day, every single minute. With me it wasn't</br>   like that. She already was remarried with my stepdad, of course. It was</br>   really difficult for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I can imagine.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are your sister and your brother children with this stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, they're Americans.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: So, they're, yes, yes. They're both‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you get along with them?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Quite good. I mean, they're my siblings. I cannot stop loving them.</br>   I really can't. Since I got there, my brother was around three, so it was</br>   hard because I didn't know him, but throughout time it got better. The</br>   relationship really got strong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There are two years difference?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah, about two, no, three, four years. Yeah, because he's sixteen</br>   right now. My sister's, she's turning twelve on June 15th.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you're nineteen?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the border crossing difficult? How did you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I don't remember. That's the only thing I don't. I don't know if my</br>   brain blocked it because it was traumatizing. I really have tried to</br>   remember, and I can't. I don't know why, but I really can't. [Chuckles].</br>   It's weird because the thing that I remember is a smell, a certain smell</br>   that when you get a cold and you get sick. It's so distinguishing that if I</br>   smell it, it'll just throw me back. I can't really describe the smell, but</br>   it's just one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were five. You get to the States. You're living with your mom.</br>   Your dad is somewhere in ____, too.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you see him?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. Until I was around seven to eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did he try to look for you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. Well, to my knowledge, no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ask about him?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't really know about him. No one ever told me, &quot;Oh, this is</br>   your dad.&quot; Or someone showed me pictures. My grandma says she did, but I</br>   don't remember. I don't recall.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your stepdad treat you well?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. I actually never had an issue with him, which was the great</br>   thing about it, because other stepdads, or other step parents, might treat</br>   you differently than their kids, or set you aside, or not buy you this, or</br>   if they're going out, leave you at home. He never did anything to make me</br>   feel uncomfortable or that I wasn't his kid. Nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You get to the U.S. and you go to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am. Kindergarten.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like? Do you remember that? When do your memories</br>   start?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: [Chuckles] They do start in kindergarten, but then again, I went</br>   to‚ÄîI don't remember how many schools during elementary. Then in middle</br>   school, my mom really had a struggle settling down, because in ____ there's</br>   some areas where they have a lot of crime. It was kind of rough, but now</br>   she's settled down.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But she moved around in ____ all the time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you spent your whole time in elementary school in ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I went to about three schools in elementary and about two in</br>   middle school and then one in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then here, I went to, technically, it's one, but you know how here</br>   in Mexico they have a name in the morning shift and then a name in the</br>   second, the afternoon shift? So, I went to both of them. It was chaos</br>   throughout my whole life. Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No stability at all?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. [Chuckle]. None at all. My life has been all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have friends?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I was actually surprised, because sometimes it's hard. It's</br>   really hard, because they'll look at you and they can tell you're not from</br>   here. It's difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you know that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: When I was small, no. Then when I got older, in my teenage years, I</br>   did have the knowledge, but I was afraid and embarrassed for anyone to find</br>   out. Especially in school [Chuckle]. But I didn't know that education wise,</br>   they don't have a problem with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why were you embarrassed about being undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I was embarrassed about being undocumented because I didn't want to</br>   get bullied. I was so afraid because I have seen cases where kids have been</br>   bullied. My brother was bullied. I didn't want to go through that. I was so</br>   scared, and I didn't want to leave my family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You mean you didn't want to get deported?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah, I didn't want to get deported at all. I don't think anyone</br>   does. No one wants to go through all the process. It's pretty scary.</br>   [Emotional].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was a secret that you kept?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Being undocumented was my darkest secret. I didn't want anyone to</br>   find out. I was terrified. I didn't want to be separated from my family</br>   again, [Emotional] because I didn't grow up with them for about four years.</br>   It was extremely hard. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I can't imagine... I mean, you talk about fear, you talk about being</br>   ashamed, and then there's the issue about having to keep a secret.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Imagine‚Ä¶ I don't think anyone being a citizen has a fear of</br>   anything. They're free to go anywhere they want. They're free to do</br>   whatever they want. They can study all the way to where they want to get,</br>   and we don't. We don't get that opportunity. [Crying]. I don't think anyone</br>   should go through that. It's just, it's not fair. I had dreams when I was a</br>   little kid. I wanted to be someone in life. I wanted to have a career. That</br>   was probably the main reason of why I decided to drop out because I</br>   figured, I mean, I'm not going to get to go to college, I'm not going to</br>   get to have a career here, so why do I even try? They make us feel less,</br>   like we don't matter at all, like our lives are just worthless, and that's</br>   not the case. We contribute to everything. We try to follow the law. Still,</br>   that doesn't count. That doesn't matter at all. It's really, really hard.</br>   It's extremely hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you'd had the chance, what would you have become?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I wanted to be a veterinarian. That was my dream. Or a teacher. I</br>   love kids. I love to teach. I love to help everyone. If I see someone</br>   struggling, I want to help them, and I can't. I felt like I could never do</br>   that. It's really hard seeing how some people don't even value that. A lot</br>   of American citizens don't look at it that way. They really don't care.</br>   They're like, &quot;Oh, well, you're not from here. So, we can't do anything.&quot;</br>   That's just it. That's the reality for a lot, a lot, a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I just want you to know, that's why we're doing this project. So</br>   that your voice gets heard. How did you come back to Mexico? When did you</br>   go back the first time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: The first time it was when I was fourteen, 2014, because I was born</br>   in 2000 so it kind of goes by the year. Like I said, I came back as a</br>   family reunion, but it kind of extended a little.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You came back to visit your family, you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am. I came back to visit my family. Well, my dad, and meet</br>   my little sister. That's why I came, and to visit my grandparents that I</br>   hadn't seen in ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you came back, did you know that you would have to cross the</br>   border again to go back? Were you planning to stay? What were you thinking?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't know I was going to cross again because my mom said that it</br>   might turn into a permanent stay if she didn't figure out a way to get me</br>   back. Well, at the end of the day, she did figure out a way for me to get</br>   back. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long were you here for?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Around a year and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: When I was sixteen in the United States. I was going to high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. Let's go back. A year and a half after, you're fifteen now and</br>   you go back? When did you go back to the United States the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I was turning sixteen, almost.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And here you were going to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you cross the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Basically, with fake documents. That was how because my mom didn't</br>   want me to go through the normal way, I guess, of crossing the border. She</br>   didn't want me to go through that because when I was five, she kind of knew</br>   that my brain was going to block it and I wasn't going to be able to</br>   remember, but when I was fourteen, there's no way for me to not remember</br>   that. So, she tried to get the best thing that she could. She paid a lot of</br>   money for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got somebody's U.S. papers and you crossed by bus?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. That's exactly how.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There was no trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. There wasn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you go back to ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you go back to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Then what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then I dropped out when I was sixteen and I started working.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I dropped out because I had personal issues with my mom and, well,</br>   in my mind, I didn't think there was enough. I mean, even if I finished</br>   high school, I wasn't going to be able to keep on studying what I wanted to</br>   study. I had good grades in school. I mean, at the end of the day, what</br>   does it really mean? If it's not worth anything. I mean, you can do your</br>   best. You can at the top of your class and it still doesn't mean anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you at the top of your class?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: One of them. In certain classes, yes, I was the best. In math class,</br>   in other classes [Chuckle], but in others I was like the second.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you were a really good student?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I always tried my best. Even if I missed a day, I was already</br>   caught up. I always tried. My mom was really proud of me. I remember, she</br>   kept all my diplomas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you proud of you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Of course, because I didn't think I was going to, at least reach</br>   that high. [Emotional]. I mean, I kind of regret not finishing it, but it</br>   wasn't going to help me anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were angry?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. At the laws. They say it's a free country, but it's not free</br>   for us. We got to work every day. You wake up at 6:00 A.M., you get home at</br>   8:00, and it's still the same thing. Every day. No one sees that. No one.</br>   No one pays attention to what we go through. What we struggle. Some</br>   Hispanics really can't afford a lot of things, and no one tries to help</br>   them out. And when they try like right now‚Ä¶. I mean, Donald Trump really</br>   took a lot of things away. A lot of advantages, a lot of help, gone. We</br>   can't get them back. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: We're going to fight. You have some Americans here on your side.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Thank you. It really does mean a lot. It seems like a small help,</br>   but it's a lot because no one has ever came up to me and asked, &quot;How are</br>   you doing? How do think that's going to affect you? What do you think's</br>   going to happen?&quot; No one asks. They're just like, &quot;Oh, well, you don't</br>   belong here. You're not from here. You shouldn't even be here.&quot; That's how</br>   they treat us, and that's reality. You can't say anything back to them</br>   because at the end of the day it's kind of true, but it shouldn't be that</br>   way. They say we have equal rights. I don't see it. [Chuckle]. I really</br>   don't. We're not equal to them. We're not equal, and we work a lot harder.</br>   We really try our best. We try to follow everything step by step at the</br>   foot of everything. That doesn't help us. Some actually do become American</br>   citizens, and every time you see a case like that, it's like, &quot;Wow,</br>   congratulations. You deserve it.&quot; Because who doesn't want to? Who doesn't</br>   want to be treated like an American citizen? We're not treated that way. We</br>   always get discriminated by something, and that's not fair. I don't think</br>   anyone, from any country, from anywhere in the world should ever get</br>   treated that way. I just don't believe it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You're working now?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I'm working.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="a5dd8610-b1d4-412b-a9c2-d44845f5f9ee" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Working, Jobs,  construction,  cleaning">Anita: What jobs did you work in the States?<br>

   Joana: Oh, in the States? I worked pretty much construction jobs. Framing,<br>

   construction jobs, yards.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How many women were doing that?<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you were a really good student?<br>
 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Basically, with fake documents. That was how because my mom didn't<br>
   want me to go through the normal way, I guess, of crossing the border. She<br>
   didn't want me to go through that because when I was five, she kind of knew<br>
   that my brain was going to block it and I wasn't going to be able to<br>
   remember, but when I was fourteen, there's no way for me to not remember<br>
   that. So, she tried to get the best thing that she could. She paid a lot of<br>

 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: When I was small, no. Then when I got older, in my teenage years, I<br>
   did have the knowledge, but I was afraid and embarrassed for anyone to find<br>
   out. Especially in school [Chuckle]. But I didn't know that education wise,<br>
   they don't have a problem with it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why were you embarrassed about being undocumented?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: I was embarrassed about being undocumented because I didn't want to<br>
   get bullied. I was so afraid because I have seen cases where kids have been<br>
   bullied. My brother was bullied. I didn't want to go through that. I was so<br>
   scared, and I didn't want to leave my family.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You mean you didn't want to get deported?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Yeah, I didn't want to get deported at all. I don't think anyone<br>
   does. No one wants to go through all the process. It's pretty scary.<br>
   [Emotional].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: This was a secret that you kept?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Being undocumented was my darkest secret. I didn't want anyone to<br>
   find out. I was terrified. I didn't want to be separated from my family<br>
   again, [Emotional] because I didn't grow up with them for about four years.<br>
   It was extremely hard. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: I can't imagine... I mean, you talk about fear, you talk about being<br>
   ashamed, and then there's the issue about having to keep a secret.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Imagine‚Ä¶ I don't think anyone being a citizen has a fear of<br>
   anything. They're free to go anywhere they want. They're free to do<br>
   whatever they want. They can study all the way to where they want to get,<br>
   and we don't. We don't get that opportunity. [Crying]. I don't think anyone<br>
   should go through that. It's just, it's not fair. I had dreams when I was a<br>
   little kid. I wanted to be someone in life. I wanted to have a career. That<br>
   was probably the main reason of why I decided to drop out because I<br>
   figured, I mean, I'm not going to get to go to college, I'm not going to<br>
   get to have a career here, so why do I even try? They make us feel less,<br>
   like we don't matter at all, like our lives are just worthless, and that's<br>
   not the case. We contribute to everything. We try to follow the law. Still,<br>
   that doesn't count. That doesn't matter at all. It's really, really hard.<br>
   It's extremely hard.<br>

 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: [Chuckles] They do start in kindergarten, but then again, I went<br>
   to‚ÄîI don't remember how many schools during elementary. Then in middle<br>
   school, my mom really had a struggle settling down, because in ____ there's<br>
   some areas where they have a lot of crime. It was kind of rough, but now<br>
   she's settled down.<br>

 <br>

 <br>
 <br>

   to pick me up and she basically stole me, technically, because I really<br>
   didn't know her. I didn't want to leave, but I didn't have another choice.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Were you kicking and screaming?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Yes, I definitely was. I remember I opened my arms and my legs when<br>
   they were trying to force me in the taxi, because I didn't want to leave. I<br>
   was crying and yelling and screaming and I couldn't do anything. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, did it get better once you got to ____?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Yes, because I got to know her and, well, she was my mother. I<br>
   didn't have any other choice but to get to know her. I mean, it was<br>
   difficult because until this day I don't really have a lot of<br>
   communications with her. I still don't have that connection. Pretty much,<br>
   she spent her time working so we didn't really have time to actually sit<br>
   down. She didn't ask, &quot;How are you doing? How is school?&quot; Anything. &quot;Do you<br>
   have problems? Are you having trouble?&quot; I mean, nothing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, why did she want to take you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: Well, she said that I was her daughter and that she loved me. Well,<br>
   she was sending money, she was taking care of me in a way, but I just<br>
   wasn't living with her. But it wasn't her choice either, because when she<br>
   left, she couldn't take me at that time. She tried to get me with her, and<br>
   she actually did. So, it was basically that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you think her lack of affection, as you've described it, was<br>
   because you didn't spend your first few years together?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Joana: I think so. I think that has a lot to do with it, because I kind of<br>
   see the way she treats my brother and my sister‚Äîshe had them since they<br>
   were born‚Äîevery year, every day, every single minute. With me it wasn't<br>
   like that. She already was remarried with my stepdad, of course. It was<br>
   really difficult for me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: I can imagine.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are your sister and your brother children with this stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, they're Americans.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: So, they're, yes, yes. They're both‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do you get along with them?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Quite good. I mean, they're my siblings. I cannot stop loving them.</br>   I really can't. Since I got there, my brother was around three, so it was</br>   hard because I didn't know him, but throughout time it got better. The</br>   relationship really got strong.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There are two years difference?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah, about two, no, three, four years. Yeah, because he's sixteen</br>   right now. My sister's, she's turning twelve on June 15th.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you're nineteen?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was the border crossing difficult? How did you cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I don't remember. That's the only thing I don't. I don't know if my</br>   brain blocked it because it was traumatizing. I really have tried to</br>   remember, and I can't. I don't know why, but I really can't. [Chuckles].</br>   It's weird because the thing that I remember is a smell, a certain smell</br>   that when you get a cold and you get sick. It's so distinguishing that if I</br>   smell it, it'll just throw me back. I can't really describe the smell, but</br>   it's just one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were five. You get to the States. You're living with your mom.</br>   Your dad is somewhere in ____, too.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you see him?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. Until I was around seven to eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did he try to look for you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. Well, to my knowledge, no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ask about him?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't really know about him. No one ever told me, &quot;Oh, this is</br>   your dad.&quot; Or someone showed me pictures. My grandma says she did, but I</br>   don't remember. I don't recall.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your stepdad treat you well?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yeah. I actually never had an issue with him, which was the great</br>   thing about it, because other stepdads, or other step parents, might treat</br>   you differently than their kids, or set you aside, or not buy you this, or</br>   if they're going out, leave you at home. He never did anything to make me</br>   feel uncomfortable or that I wasn't his kid. Nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You get to the U.S. and you go to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am. Kindergarten.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like?

So, I went to both of them. It was chaos</br>   throughout my whole life. Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No stability at all?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. [Chuckle]. None at all.

That was my dream. Or a teacher. I</br>   love kids. I love to teach. I love to help everyone. If I see someone</br>   struggling, I want to help them, and I can't. I felt like I could never do</br>   that. It's really hard seeing how some people don't even value that. A lot</br>   of American citizens don't look at it that way. They really don't care.</br>   They're like, &quot;Oh, well, you're not from here. So, we can't do anything.&quot;</br>   That's just it. That's the reality for a lot, a lot, a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I just want you to know, that's why we're doing this project. So</br>   that your voice gets heard. How did you come back to Mexico? When did you</br>   go back the first time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: The first time it was when I was fourteen, 2014, because I was born</br>   in 2000 so it kind of goes by the year. Like I said, I came back as a</br>   family reunion, but it kind of extended a little.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You came back to visit your family, you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am. I came back to visit my family. Well, my dad, and meet</br>   my little sister. That's why I came, and to visit my grandparents that I</br>   hadn't seen in ten years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you came back, did you know that you would have to cross the</br>   border again to go back? Were you planning to stay? What were you thinking?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't know I was going to cross again because my mom said that it</br>   might turn into a permanent stay if she didn't figure out a way to get me</br>   back. Well, at the end of the day, she did figure out a way for me to get</br>   back. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long were you here for?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Around a year and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: When I was sixteen in the United States. I was going to high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. Let's go back. A year and a half after, you're fifteen now and</br>   you go back? When did you go back to the United States the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I was turning sixteen, almost.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And here you were going to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you cross the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Basically, with fake documents. That was how because my mom didn't</br>   want me to go through the normal way, I guess, of crossing the border. She</br>   didn't want me to go through that because when I was five, she kind of knew</br>   that my brain was going to block it and I wasn't going to be able to</br>   remember, but when I was fourteen, there's no way for me to not remember</br>   that. So, she tried to get the best thing that she could. She paid a lot of</br>   money for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got somebody's U.S. papers and you crossed by bus?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. That's exactly how.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: There was no trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. There wasn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you go back to ____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you go back to school?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Then what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then I dropped out when I was sixteen and I started working.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I dropped out because I had personal issues with my mom and, well,</br>   in my mind, I didn't think there was enough. I mean, even if I finished</br>   high school, I wasn't going to be able to keep on studying what I wanted to</br>   study. I had good grades in school. I mean, at the end of the day, what</br>   does it really mean? If it's not worth anything. I mean, you can do your</br>   best. You can at the top of your class and it still doesn't mean anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you at the top of your class?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: One of them. In certain classes, yes, I was the best. In math class,</br>   in other classes [Chuckle], but in others I was like the second.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you were a really good student?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I always tried my best. Even if I missed a day, I was already</br>   caught up. I always tried. My mom was really proud of me. I remember, she</br>   kept all my diplomas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you proud of you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Of course, because I didn't think I was going to, at least reach</br>   that high. [Emotional]. I mean, I kind of regret not finishing it, but it</br>   wasn't going to help me anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were angry?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. At the laws. They say it's a free country, but it's not free</br>   for us. We got to work every day. You wake up at 6:00 A.M., you get home at</br>   8:00, and it's still the same thing. Every day. No one sees that. No one.</br>   No one pays attention to what we go through. What we struggle. Some</br>   Hispanics really can't afford a lot of things, and no one tries to help</br>   them out. And when they try like right now‚Ä¶. I mean, Donald Trump really</br>   took a lot of things away. A lot of advantages, a lot of help, gone. We</br>   can't get them back. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: We're going to fight. You have some Americans here on your side.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Thank you. It really does mean a lot. It seems like a small help,</br>   but it's a lot because no one has ever came up to me and asked, &quot;How are</br>   you doing? How do think that's going to affect you? What do you think's</br>   going to happen?&quot; No one asks. They're just like, &quot;Oh, well, you don't</br>   belong here. You're not from here. You shouldn't even be here.&quot; That's how</br>   they treat us, and that's reality. You can't say anything back to them</br>   because at the end of the day it's kind of true, but it shouldn't be that</br>   way. They say we have equal rights. I don't see it. [Chuckle]. I really</br>   don't. We're not equal to them. We're not equal, and we work a lot harder.</br>   We really try our best. We try to follow everything step by step at the</br>   foot of everything. That doesn't help us. Some actually do become American</br>   citizens, and every time you see a case like that, it's like, &quot;Wow,</br>   congratulations. You deserve it.&quot; Because who doesn't want to? Who doesn't</br>   want to be treated like an American citizen? We're not treated that way. We</br>   always get discriminated by something, and that's not fair. I don't think</br>   anyone, from any country, from anywhere in the world should ever get</br>   treated that way. I just don't believe it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You're working now?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I'm working.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What jobs did you work in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Oh, in the States? I worked pretty much construction jobs. Framing,</br>   roofing, vinyl, painting. I worked in lawns. I've worked pretty much</br>   construction jobs, yards.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many women were doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Not a lot. My mom does cleaning, that's her job and she loves it. I</br>   love cleaning, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Houses?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. Houses, apartments, she works inside and out. She's pretty</br>   great.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Does she have her papers?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No, she doesn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did all this and then how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I got arrested in _____. I moved to ______when I was about</br>   seventeen. I stayed about a year and that's when I.C.E. took me in.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For what?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: It was, I think, an illegal turn, a U-turn. I was driving without a</br>   license because we can't get a license, but yet again, we do have to get to</br>   work. I mean, how are you going to expect anyone to get to work if they</br>   don't have transportation? You have to drive. It's probably the main thing</br>   that, why a lot of people get deported. That and raids.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is this the first time you were stopped just for making an illegal</br>   turn?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's the first thing you did?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. Well I had tickets, but I had never gotten arrested. I pretty</br>   much always paid my tickets.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Then what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: And then, well, I went into custody. They tried to get me out, but</br>   they couldn't. I.C.E. took me in. That's how I got back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For how long?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: For about a month, and I got out pretty quickly because I had my</br>   passport with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just happened to have your passport with you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No, that was the only I.D. I had.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were carrying it with you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. I didn't have any American I.D.s. I mean, we can't get them, so</br>   that was the only I.D. I had‚Äîmy passport. That's how they got my</br>   nationality and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were there a lot of other women in detention?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, but not a lot. There were mainly men, mainly. Actually, I had</br>   already gotten stopped, but I was a minor and they hadn't taken any</br>   information on me because I got stopped going to work. It was really early,</br>   and we, the other guys that were with me, were about to leave the apartment</br>   complexes where we used to live. All of a sudden, we just got stopped by</br>   two I.C.E. officers. They never identified themselves. They didn't say why</br>   we got stopped. They pretty much didn't give out any information at all.</br>   They just went in and I.D.-ed them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What year are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That was around 2016. In _____.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you go stopped by I.C.E., it was in _____?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. The first time it was in ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. And in ______?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Then the second time it was in 2019.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it was Trump?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, it was Trump, when Trump was already in. Basically, he started</br>   a lot of, he provoked a lot of stops. In ____, everyone's scared until</br>   today, everyone. I see a lot of Hispanics watching out for each other. I've</br>   seen a lot of posts on Facebook saying, &quot;Hey, watch out. There's a...&quot; What</br>   do you...?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Raid.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: &quot;Raid on certain street or on certain highway. Just be careful.&quot;</br>   Everyone's always trying to help each other out.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. You know, we've been trying to do the same work in the U.S.</br>   and we can't because people are too afraid to talk to us.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, I know. Everyone thinks they're going to get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That's basically what everyone's scared of because they don't want</br>   to lose the opportunity, because going to Mexico and the United States</br>   there's not even a comparison.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean by that?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Here, for example, if someone rapes you and you go to a police</br>   officer, sometimes they really won't help you. There's a lot of corruption</br>   that's mainly everywhere, from the president down. Everyone. It's pretty</br>   weird because the cartels, they're actually the ones that actually help</br>   their states out. They actually offer jobs and the president doesn't. It's</br>   like, why? But, it's just the way it is. You're actually scared to actually</br>   go up to a police officer because you know that if you get stopped, they're</br>   not going to read you the laws. They're going to ask you for money. You're</br>   not going to see a U.S. officer do that, ever. They're going to arrest you</br>   on the spot. Here, they don't do that. That's how Mexico is.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel American or Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: More American because I grew up in America.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does it mean, being American?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: There's a lot... Being American, to me, it means you can do, you can</br>   be free. You can live your life like you want to. That doesn't mean you're</br>   going to break the laws. That doesn't mean you're going to commit an</br>   offense, but it means that you can actually live freely and without the</br>   worry that you're going to get deported anytime. I don't think that's</br>   living because you're always afraid. You're always afraid of anyone and</br>   everyone. You never know when that person's going to stab you in the back</br>   and call I.C.E. on you. That's what everyone's afraid of. Everyone doesn't</br>   want to say that they're undocumented. No one wants to admit it because</br>   everyone's scared. You don't get the same rights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you say you feel more American than Mexican, what does that</br>   mean to you to feel it? I mean, I know that you're not an American citizen.</br>   What does it feel culturally or whatever way? In what way do you feel</br>   American?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I guess in every way. There's a lot more connection to me with an</br>   American citizen than there is with a Mexican citizen. The cultures,</br>   they're so different. I mean, pizza isn't really even pizza here to be</br>   honest. A hamburger isn't a hamburger. It's an American dish. In Mexico</br>   they have other foods. They have other cultures. They have a variety of</br>   things. Being American, to me, it feels like I can go travel. I don't even</br>   know how to explain it. I just don't know how to put it. I guess, it means</br>   to me, it feels like... I really, I don't have the words right now. I guess</br>   it would feel... I don't, I can't find the words.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It doesn't matter. I have two more questions for you. What are your</br>   hopes and dreams now that you're back in Mexico? What do you want to do</br>   with your life?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I want to have a career. Now that I can, that I actually have the</br>   opportunity. Because in the United States, it was just like, &quot;Why do I even</br>   try? Why do I even bother? I mean, at the end of the day, I'm not going to</br>   actually be what I want.&quot; The thing is, the education, it's really high in</br>   the United States; it's way better than here in Mexico. Here in Mexico it's</br>   just like, &quot;Oh, well, you've got to learn this. You've got to learn that.&quot;</br>   I mean, I feel like I would have a lot of trouble here because I mainly</br>   will understand more in English than Spanish. So, if they're talking about</br>   laws or they're talking about this or that, I kind of get a lot confused.</br>   Not a little bit, a lot. It's like, &quot;Oh my God.‚Äù I don't even understand</br>   what they're saying. I don't get a lot of professional terms. I don't</br>   understand them at all. My co-workers, if I don't understand something in</br>   Spanish, they'll be like, &quot;Oh, it's this.&quot; It's like, &quot;Oh, okay, okay. I</br>   get it now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where are you working now?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: At T-Tech.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: T-Tech.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of career are you going to have here?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Well, since T-Tech does offer, after three months of being with</br>   them, to continue studying and working for obviously much more economical</br>   payment‚Äîit has to be related to what I'm working on. So, I might go into</br>   business or I'm still not sure.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you won't be a veterinarian?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Not anymore. [Chuckles]. Once I get a career and I start‚Äîbecause</br>   right now we're in training‚Äîonce the three months are over, I want to save</br>   up at least half of my money and actually donate to a shelter for mainly</br>   dogs because here in Mexico there's a lot of dogs on the streets. A lot,</br>   like a lot. Apparently, they don't help them. There's actually a lot of‚Äî</br> </br> </br>   Anita: They don‚Äôt help people‚Ä¶</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Exactly. If they don't help us, they're not going to help an</br>   innocent animal. They'll kill them. Even if you get into an accident or</br>   they run you over, they'll go back and run you over until pretty much</br>   you're dead just because they don't want to pay your hospitality in the</br>   hospital. They don't want to pay it. They'll be like, &quot;Oh, she died. Might</br>   as well pay that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I have two more questions for you. One is to go back to the States</br>   for one second. What we've noticed are some young women, who live through</br>   the horror of being undocumented and parents who are absent become teen</br>   mothers. Why does that happen and did this happen to you?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No. This didn't happen to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Explain this to me.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I believe it didn't happen to me just because my mom did have me at</br>   a young age. She had me when she was fifteen. So, I didn't want to go</br>   through that. I didn't want to not have the experience of going to school</br>   and having friends and going out and actually enjoying my life as a</br>   teenager and just moving straight to having a kid‚Äîbeing responsible and</br>   taking care of him and working and still having to pay day care and</br>   everything. I didn't want to go through that. I didn't think I was fit</br>   enough, I guess. I mean, you're young. I know you learn things, and there's</br>   no book that just states it there that you have to do this, and you have to</br>   do that. No. You kind of have to experience things to learn from them. I</br>   don't think I wanted to go through that. I believe a lot of young girls go</br>   through it because sometimes, especially, I guess, Hispanics, they have to</br>   work to maintain everything‚Äîhome, kids, everything, cars. So, pretty much,</br>   they get left alone and they're not taken care of so they have a lot of</br>   liberty. I think that's why.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever want to be part of the streets or a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I didn't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why not?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I saw a lot of things that could happen to you. You could get raped</br>   by all of them. Nobody wants to go through that, or nobody wants to get</br>   beat up to join a gang. Why even go through the struggle? I don't find it</br>   logical to be honest. I mean, I don't want to go through suffering to be in</br>   a gang to make other people suffer. I really don't get it. I mean, you</br>   could work to get money. Why do you have to rob someone? Why do you have to</br>   beat someone up? Why do you have to stab them and shoot them?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that's just because that's the way your mind was wired?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Yes. That's the way I saw things.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because your mother wasn't present.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was just you.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: But she did give me advice, but it wasn't a huge conversation that</br>   we had. Just every time that maybe I did something wrong, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Don't do this because this could happen.&quot; Or, &quot;Do this instead.&quot; Or,</br>   &quot;Don't do something good that seems bad because that could affect you.&quot; I</br>   think that was what formed my mind.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Something that we're thinking about and we want to write about is</br>   what the U.S. loses by deporting people and what Mexico actually gains by</br>   receiving people like you. Let me ask you that. What does the U.S. lose by</br>   deporting people like Joana?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Well, they lose mainly trust because you don't trust anyone. You're</br>   always afraid. We live in fear. You don't trust anyone. What they lose is</br>   workers. We pay taxes. They lose, maybe, ties to certain things in Mexico</br>   because they do have to export, import. If this keeps going on, at the end</br>   of the day, they're going to stop because Donald Trump doesn't apparently</br>   want us in the United States, so why does Mexico have to give them anything</br>   that's Mexican? I mean, Mexico is a country where they do have a lot of</br>   oil, they have coffee, what don't they have? I mean, we have a lot of</br>   tourists that come to Mexico. Trump has towers here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does Mexico gain by you guys coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I think, I'm not sure‚Äî[Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what do you think? What do you have to give to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Maybe, because a lot people think of investing in the United States,</br>   so once they leave, they're going to invest in Mexico. I think a lot of</br>   investments.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As a person, what do you bring?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Your freedom, you gain your freedom to be honest. You're not afraid</br>   here. You're not afraid of anyone coming up to you and saying, &quot;Oh, you're</br>   a wetback. Oh, you don't belong here.&quot; Because this is your country. I</br>   think, as a person, you gain calmness. You don't have to be afraid anymore,</br>   but then again, you kind of don't want to be in Mexico because of all the</br>   corruption.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you could help change that corruption in Mexico because</br>   of your experience growing up in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: I think if we all join forces, we could change everything. It's only</br>   if you put your mind to it. You can change a lot of things. It's not going</br>   to take a day, but eventually it will happen. If all of us join together</br>   and work together, we can change a lot of things in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think the deported migrants, if you all join together you can</br>   change something?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: Definitely. There's a lot of people here that got deported. A lot.</br>   Day after day it's the same thing. Pretty much the same reasons. Either</br>   they got stopped at work, a raid, you name it, but it's pretty much the</br>   same reasons that we come back.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you have anything else you want to say? You've told me so much.</br>   I'm so appreciative.</br> </br> </br>   Joana: No, I don't think there is. I think I've said enough. I don't think</br>   anyone should go through that. It's pain, it's painful. You don't know how</br>   many nights I've fallen asleep crying just thinking about everything that</br>   someone could say to you or things that they have said to me. You don't</br>   know how much your words can hurt a person. How much just a simple word</br>   could end their life. A lot of people have committed suicide because of</br>   that, because they couldn't bear with everything that's going on. A lot of</br>   people have lost their lives. I don't think it's fair. No one should have</br>   to be afraid of going outside or going to work. You're just going to work.</br>   You're not doing anything bad. You're not going against the law. I mean,</br>   you're working. You're trying. As a student, you try every day. Other kids</br>   do bully you if they find out that you're not a U.S. citizen. They'll call</br>   you names. They'll pick on you. Some have been kicked, punched, etc. That's</br>   not what a kid should go through, especially not if you're really young. A</br>   lot of five-year-olds go through that. Imagine a kid going through that. An</br>   innocent child that shouldn't be put through that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about being separated from your family?</br> </br> </br>   Joana: That's, I think, the hardest part. Imagine you growing up with your</br>   family, with your sister, your brother, your siblings, your grandparents,</br>   your aunts, your cousins and then all of a sudden, they're gone because</br>   they don't want you in the country. It's supposed to be a free country.</br>   That everyone should be equal. It says it everywhere. Yet, again, we're</br>   not. We're not equal. They don't treat us the same. They do push us aside</br>   and society doesn't really do anything about it.</br> </div><\p>
