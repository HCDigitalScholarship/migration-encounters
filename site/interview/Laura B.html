Why you</br>   came, why your parents might have brought you, how old you were, your first</br>   impressions?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Okay. When I went to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>, I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12 years old</span> approximately. I'm</br>   right now <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">26 years old</span>. I used to live on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Iguala Guerrero</span>, and if you know,</br>   Guerrero is one of the poorest states in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: So we were really struggling with a lot of payments. Sometimes we</br>   didn't have anything to eat. We ate tacos, and that was all we ate in a</br>   whole day. So the education was pretty bad. Sometimes we went to school or</br>   sometimes we didn't because, well, we didn't have money to go to the</br>   school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: My mom was getting paid well, a really low wage. She was getting</br>   paid <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">about 700 pesos</span> per week. That's about ... I'm not sure. Is that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">$35   per</span> week]? We were struggling a lot. When we went to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, we're trying</br>   to look for better living, having to eat something. I don't know. Like, a</br>   lifestyle, a proper lifestyle.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you remember the crossing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, I do remember it. Well, I'm afraid of mice. So, when we</br>   crossed the border, it was actually really awkward for me because we went</br>   into a tunnel. It was really dark, though.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: So, when we went through the tunnel, I remember it was pretty dark.</br>   We have a lot of mice on our feet and snakes. Oh my god, even if you have</br>   the eyes open you cannot see anything because everything was dark. The</br>   coyote was telling us not to make any noises. I was like, “I want to scream</br>   because I'm feeling the mice on my feet. I just want to scream and say, ‘Oh</br>   my god,’ or ‘Ah,’ something, but I couldn't.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: My brother, when we crossed the border—my mom has already been in</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> for one year, so we crossed the border by ourselves]—when we went</br>   with the coyote, he was like, &quot;Do not make any noises. We're going to</br>   walk.” I don't remember how much we walk. We were pretty tired. We can only</br>   carry <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> bottle of water and we have already taken all, and when we cross</br>   the whole border, there was a car. It was waiting for us. We went to the</br>   car, they put a bandage in our eyes so we don't see the road.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: The coyote was always telling us to not make any noises because the</br>   border patrol was going to get us caught. I do remember everything like the</br>   experience was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">yesterday</span>. So, when we got in the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it was just you, and your brother, and the coyote?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: And the coyote?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That was it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, it was me, my brother, the coyote, and another <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> people.</br>   It was a partner: the kid, one kid, and another, a man. We were like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span></br>   people, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">six</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">seven</span> people. Kind of remember—it was a long time ago. My mom</br>   was not there because we went by ourselves. She was already in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> so</br>   she pay to get us into the other side. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, did your father come, too?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: We didn't live with our father. He was really an alcoholic, crazy,</br>   alcoholic man. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you leave behind relatives and friends? Was it hard to leave?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was really hard. It was complicated because my grandmother was</br>   really sick. So when we left her, she was really sick and she died <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span></br>   month later. So it was really sad. My friends, we left them behind. We</br>   never talk once. Once we been to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> we have never talk since, so.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's sad. So did your mom eventually meet you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Where did she meet you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span>. She's living right now in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span>, so we met her in</br>   Chicago as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So that was a long trip on your own.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, it was a long trip. We did it. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Must've been good to see her.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was amazing, yeah. She was working and the coyote told us that</br>   she was working. Since we were the last <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> people with the coyote, the</br>   coyote took us to our mom. She was in a restaurant because she work as a</br>   waitress. And when we got there, she was crying. She was actually carrying</br>   dishes and the dishes just fall because she was really impressed. We</br>   haven't seen her in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span> so she was really impressed and she drop all</br>   the dishes. We were all crying, you know. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. That's great. Did the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> seem strange to you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was strange at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. Well, it was too big for us, you know?</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Iguala</span> is really small, our city was really small. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span> is such a huge</br>   city. The buildings are really amazing, so I remember that we were really</br>   impressed. We couldn't believe that we were in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span></br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: So we went in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">October</span>, so it was really beautiful</br>   because the trees has those leaves color red, and some of the trees doesn't</br>   have any leaves, so it was really cool. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is your brother older or younger?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: He's younger. When we went to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span> and he was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10</span>,</br>   approximately.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, did you know any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, we learned in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You did. How did you learn?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I learned by myself because back in the time, there was no ESL</br>   classes. So, when we went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span>, my mom took the time to get us into a</br>   bilingual school. And in the bilingual school, some of the classes were in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and others in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, and I learn by hearing my classmates. And</br>   the teacher was always like, &quot;Hey do this,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;What?&quot; And he</br>   pointed at what I had to do, so I learned by seeing and hearing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So no ESL?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No ESL. Until high school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And what grade did you start?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I started on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">seventh</span> grade. Yeah, it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven grade</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you didn't lose any time in school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, we didn't. Well, my brother, he was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">fifth</span> grade so he started</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">fifth</span> grade and I started in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">seventh</span>, so we didn't lose any timeframe.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long did it take to feel comfortable in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Oh my god, I still don't feel confident because we have a lot of</br>   bully when we start to talk in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. The kids were like making fun of us</br>   because we didn't have any good <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> of course. They were like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span></br>   so they were basically always bullying us because we were not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. So</br>   that was one of the, how do you say, the—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: The barriers?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: The barriers, yeah. The barriers, took us more time to learn</br>   English. Yeah it was actually pretty complicated. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: At first it was awkward. I didn't want to go to school because the</br>   kids were all making bully. They were all bullies. I actually got into a</br>   fight about two times because the kids were always making fun of us, that</br>   we were like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. But after that, in high school, it got better.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you make friends?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah I did, a lot. [Chuckles]. But in high school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were they from all different?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, I actually have a lot of friends. I have a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Muslim</span> friend</br>   actually. They were all different cultures because I went to a bilingual</br>   school as well, a bilingual high school. Most of my friends were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span></br>   so they didn't know I was undocumented and I didn't tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you know all along that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, I did. But, my brother, he took a lot of more time to realize</br>   that we were not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> because when he went to the US, he was really a</br>   kid, so he didn't realize that it was illegal. [chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your mother learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, too?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: She tried, but it was a little more complicated for her because</br>   there are no programs that support those kinds of like, to learn English</br>   undocumented. She's afraid that if she got into one of those programs, the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> is going to get her caught, so that's why.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, she was afraid?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, she was afraid.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did she work a lot?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, she did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: In the restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: She did work a lot in a restaurant. Right now, she's manager of a</br>   restaurant. She's the manager but she did a lot of work. She was never</br>   around the house because she has to work a lot. She was always saying that,</br>   &quot;If I came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span> it's to get you in school, and to always have money</br>   so we don't end back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot; That was her idea.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, then you became the mother of your brother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, kind of. I was always taking care of him. I teach him how to</br>   cook, or how to make the stuff. Basically, I learn from my mom, but my</br>   brother learn from me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So how did school compare to the schooling that you'd had in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was actually better, the education. I afraid to tell this, but</br>   the education is better in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span> than in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. We have a lot of sports,</br>   we have the art classes, and in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> we didn't have any of those. We only</br>   have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and math, and that's it. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you did well in school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I did. I actually went into the honors roll. When I graduated from</br>   high school, I graduate as top <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">10</span> and I graduate as number <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> in my</br>   generation. I earned a scholarship to get into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the University of Chicago</span>,</br>   but it was only for one semester and I couldn't pay the whole career.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you got a scholarship to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the University of Chicago</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. For one semester?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: For one semester?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And did you go?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I try, but since I have to work and I have to go to school, I</br>   couldn't manage that. It was too much for me. I couldn't. It was too much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you didn't even try, I mean you did not go—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I did one semester, but the rest of that I couldn't because I didn't</br>   have any money. My family needed the money, so I try to help my mom, but</br>   ... well it was not enough. The school in America's really expensive.</br>   [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you enjoy college?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: The only one semester I went, yeah, I did. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And what were you hoping to do with college?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I was trying to get into the medical school. I was in liberal arts</br>   of science, but I changed my mind and I wanted to get into the medical</br>   school, but I couldn't. It was a lot of money. We didn't have any money. We</br>   did have money to get into the basics, but we didn't have enough to pay my</br>   school of course.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, when you stopped college, what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I work, because-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I work as a waitress. We use fake social security numbers to get</br>   into job. I used to work at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Chili's</span>, I used to work at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Discovery</span>. I never</br>   work at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">McDonald's</span>, but my brother did. Most of the time I worked as a</br>   waitress to get money to start paying my school once again, but I realize</br>   that it was too complicated. So, then I move off to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Well, it was</br>   complicated, too. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did your brother also graduate from high school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: He did. He did graduate from high school. He got DACA, but he didn't</br>   use the DACA. Like he only work at factories because the social security</br>   number was the legal one, however, he didn't want to study.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, when you were at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the University of Chicago</span>, did you learn about</br>   DACA?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: When I was in the University, I was approximately 17 years old, kind</br>   of. Like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">17</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>. I didn't learn about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LAW">DACA</span> until I was voluntary</br>   deported. So when I get into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one day later</span>, they approve DACA.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And when was that? What year?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2011</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2010</span>? I don't remember quite well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2011</span> maybe.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2011</span> or something.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It started in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2012</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, and I was really upset because it was one day later. Like,</br>   come on. [Chuckles]. I was waiting like my whole life to be legal. When</br>   they basically give all the people that went into the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> as children the</br>   DACA, I was pretty upset. Like, what? I was in depression. Totally</br>   depression, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you were working as a waitress?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you have a boyfriend?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No. I used to have a boyfriend in high school and that was the only</br>   one. He was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. He study at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">MIT</span> [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Massachusetts Institute of   Technology</span>].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">MIT</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, so when he went to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">MIT</span> we have to broke out because</br>   actually, well you know.[Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: He was really focused on his career. I want to focus on my career as</br>   well so we broke up. That was the only boyfriend that I remember. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you said you had voluntary departure. So, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I got caught driving without any license. Well, I was told that if I</br>   voluntary departure from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, I wouldn't be in any trouble. So, I did</br>   what it was best for me because we went to a lawyer and that's what the</br>   lawyer suggest. So, that was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span>, the timeframe that the judge gave</br>   me to leave the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you got caught driving without a license? Was there an infraction</br>   or did you just get pulled over for…?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I got pulled over. Well, they didn't tell me. They tell me that I</br>   haven't made the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">five second</span> stop or something like that, but I did, but</br>   they say that I didn't. So, when the police find out that I didn't have any</br>   driver's license, he asked me about my status. I told him that it was</br>   illegal to ask about the status, but they tell me that if I was illegal</br>   they will have to call <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> on me. I was like, &quot;Come on, please don't do</br>   that.&quot; And, of course, I was begging for not to call <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span>. So, they find out</br>   that I was illegal. So, basically—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: They called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you said a lawyer told you to listen to...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, we talked to a lawyer. Well, I was having my judge</br>   appointment, like my court, but the lawyer tell me that if I voluntary</br>   departure, I didn't have to go through all of that because if they deport</br>   me, will be worse for me. So, I went to voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And how long did that take?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: They took <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about six months</span>, approximately.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And were you in detention or were you at home?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I was in home but I have the little thingy, the, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You had an ankle bracelet.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, ankle. I was like, &quot;Come on.&quot; [Chuckle]. Why?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, yeah. So, when you left, where were you going to go? Did you</br>   have a plan?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, we didn't have a plan, but we started to plan it when the</br>   circumstances got worse. So, my mom tell me that if I want to get my</br>   education, I will have to do it by myself here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. So when I got in</br>   here, it was complicated. It was complicated, but I kind of feel good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: But it was really, Oh my god, the separation, all of that. I felt it</br>   like, “Come on. Why?” Sometimes I felt like life was really unfair. When I</br>   got in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, what I have in my mind was to study, not to let my</br>   studies go for a deportation or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: With the voluntary departure did they tell you, you could go back to</br>   the US after a certain amount of time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, they told me that actually. But when I got in here, I wait</br>   about three, four years, then I apply for a scholarship for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Rochester   University</span> and they give me the scholarship for one semester and they gave</br>   me a visa for that, so.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, are you going?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I already went. [Chuckles]. I was studying nuclear physics, so they</br>   give me a scholarship for math school there is on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Rochester University</span>. So,</br>   I took it. It was my opportunity to get a visa, so I took the visa and I</br>   went to Rochester for one semester, and, of course, I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span> as</br>   well. [Chuckle]. I went to see my family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, are you going to go back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: To the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: To finish up your—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, the scholarship was from my school. I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Politécnico   [</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Instituto Politécnico Nacional</span>]. So, it was like—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like a study abroad?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, study abroad. So, they gave me that opportunity, so I took it.</br>   I didn't think twice. I had the opportunity to go to that school or to go</br>   to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Japan</span>, so I took it to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you have the opportunity to travel to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, I have. Well, when I went to the visa interview, they actually</br>   asked me about my status and I did say the truth. They didn't tell me</br>   anything about it, so they give me the visa. So, I don't know how the laws</br>   work but they give me the visa.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, let's go back to coming back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you transported by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> to the border?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, I pay my own transportation because the lawyer just tell me that</br>   I have to do it. I didn't question the lawyer. I know that, well if you are</br>   a lawyer, you have to know about laws. It was provided by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. It was a program in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> that... well it was only for immigrant</br>   women.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: So, when my mom went to the program, and they tell her that they</br>   have this good lawyer and all of that. Well, the lawyer recommend me to go</br>   back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and do not get anything from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> because if I do have to do</br>   it, it will be worse. So, I went here by bus. So we only took the bus and</br>   that's it. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you landed, or you came right to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well from the bus, it was from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span> to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nuevo Laredo</span>. The bus got</br>   into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nuevo Laredo</span>. I have to look for the bus central to get into Mexico</br>   City.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you had family here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No. I didn't have anyone. Well, as I mentioned before, my</br>   grandmother has already died so we didn't have any kind of relatives that</br>   were that important. So, when I got into here, I went by myself. I have a</br>   friend in here that I met from the internet, so I asked that friend to let</br>   me stay at his home and he allow me to stay on his home. So, basically, I</br>   have to trust in someone that I didn't knew, but I had met him since I was</br>   like 13 years old when I start using the internet so I have to trust him.</br>   [Chuckles]. He helped me to look for a job at a bakery, so that was all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I mean, the whole idea was you're going to come back and you're going</br>   to try and continue your studies? So how did that go?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: At <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, it didn't go pretty well because my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> was horrible.</br>   Right now, my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> is horrible but later, back in the time, my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span></br>   was horrible, so I had to learn. I save a lot of money to pay a school to</br>   get regularization—it was for learning how to write and how to speak</br>   properly. So, I took that course. I tried to do my test for getting to the</br>   UNAM (<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">National Autonomous University of Mexico</span>), but I couldn't. My <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span></br>   was still horrible. My reading was horrible. So, I had to adapt once again</br>   to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long did that take?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: That took <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about six months</span> probably? Or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span> because I have to</br>   work, too. Here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, they do the test <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every six months</span>, so I have to</br>   wait until I have learned very well. So, when I learn, once again, I did</br>   the test to get into the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">UNAM</span> or to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Politécnico</span>. I started on both</br>   school but I went to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Politécnico</span> to study nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: To study—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And are you still doing that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I have to finish my tests but I'm almost finished.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, when did you start?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I started back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2011</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2012</span>? Don't remember pretty well. My mother</br>   tried to help me with money, but sometimes it was not enough for me because</br>   I have to pay my bills, and she didn't know about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. She believes that</br>   it's cheaper than in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. It is kind of cheaper—well it's not that much</br>   cheaper. I have to pay my rent, my bills, and all of that. So, basically, I</br>   started to work, and I study in the school as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you were doing part time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, in that timeframe, I was doing part time. Right now, I work in</br>   a full job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you're trying to finish your undergraduate degree? Is that what</br>   you're trying to finish right now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, my undergraduate degree.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: In nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: In nuclear physics and I started that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> career, economics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: A second—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> career on economics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And so, when you graduate, you'll have a major in both?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And then what? What will you do then?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, right now, what I want to do is work in the government. Well</br>   my goal in life is to do the kind of like—you know when the President is</br>   speaking, someone writes those announcements and all of that? I want to do</br>   that. I want to write for the President, so he can deliver them. I don't</br>   know how you say that in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: A speech writer.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: A speech writer, yeah for the President, or for the government,</br>   yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see. So, what kind of job do you have now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Right now, I work in a call center for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Best Buy</span>. I do the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">City Bank</span></br>   for credit cards actually. So, I work for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the City Bank</span> and they pay pretty</br>   well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: But graduating from college, once you get your degree, will you look</br>   for a more...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I'm thinking about it because here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, the business of the</br>   science is not that good. In the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, they really try to get people to get</br>   interested in science, but in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> they don't even have a nuclear plant.</br>   So, where can I apply my career?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: So that's why I started to study economics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, will you have to get another degree in order to do what you want</br>   to do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, I will have to.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, once you graduate, will you apply to school again?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah. Once I finish my economics, I will start a masters, if</br>   possible a PhD. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> I think it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">PhD</span>, so.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So right now, you've finished classwork and you need to pass tests?</br>   Is that right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah. Well, my day is like, I go to work and when I finish working</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">about 3:00</span>— I start my day at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">7:00 AM</span> at my job, and I finish at 3:00,—and</br>   later I go to school <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">5:00 to 9 o'clock</span>, and I got into my house until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">11:00   </span>and I have to sleep, and then back again.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It's complicated, but you get used to it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: By myself.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I really miss them. Well, when I have money ... right now, I have my</br>   visa, so ... On <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">December</span>, I earned a scholarship to get into economics</br>   school in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Japan</span>, so I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Japan</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">last year</span>. And I got the time to go to</br>   see my family too. So, I just saw them in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">December</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see, I see. So, your mother's still working?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, she's still working right now. She was a waitress but now</br>   she's the manager of the restaurant so she's pretty lucky. And my brother,</br>   he has DACA, but he is working in a factory for salsas. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: When you were in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, what were your dreams?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I really wanted to be a doctor, but in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>… Oh my god, I really</br>   tried to be a doctor here, but it was complicated because most of the what</br>   is required in here to be a doctor is complicated. You need a lot of money</br>   to be a doctor. So, well, money again. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, your dreams have changed?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah. Right now, yeah I have a lot of different goals. More</br>   tangible, more realistic goals, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think you'll meet them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, I believe it because well I deserve it now. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What do you miss about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: My family. I really like the winter in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span>, the snow, you know?</br>   It's really cold. I really like to be in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span>, but the circumstances. It</br>   was complicated.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So do you think that you are different having been to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> for</br>   those years? How did it change you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: They changed me. I believe if I have stayed here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, probably</br>   I would never learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. Probably, I would not have the opportunity</br>   that I have right now to travel to any other places because I like to</br>   travel a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: So, when I try to compare myself with my friends, with my friends</br>   that we left in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Iguala</span>, what I see is that they didn't have the opportunity</br>   that I have, like to learn things, to meet some new culture, to meet</br>   people. Like they didn't have that opportunity. They stayed in that place,</br>   and they were absorbed by the violence, by the narco traffic, and</br>   everything. What I think is that I was really lucky. Kind of lucky because</br>   some things got complicated, but some things were really an experience, and</br>   they were a nice experience.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I learn a lot from people from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. They have a different</br>   culture, a different, like, you know, thinking. They don't think poorly.</br>   Always one more, and in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> we don't have that mentality.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: When you say, think one more, think...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Like, they are always out of the box—like you for your project. You</br>   are always out of the box. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, people is really closed-minded. Like,</br>   they believe that if you were born poor, you will stay poor. And I believe</br>   that's not true because what I learn in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span> is that if you want more,</br>   you can have it, but you have to work for it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the smartest kids in your classes before you left</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You were always really smart?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, when I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, it was one of the smartest one, and when</br>   I went to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, when I learned the language, I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the smartest</br>   one, well, kind of.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you don't think that being <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the smartest ones in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   would have gotten you out?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No. No, I believe that probably I will be absorbed by violence, too.</br>   Probably I would dead or something like that. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, when we talk to young women about your age who grew up primarily</br>   in the U.S.—though you had a mixed childhood—a lot of them end up getting</br>   pregnant at really young ages, at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And I just wanted you to reflect on that, and why that might happen,</br>   and why it was different for you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I'm not sure why. [laughs] Maybe the education. When I went to the</br>   US, I always have a good education programs. They teach you how to use</br>   condoms and all of that now. I admire my teachers a lot. They were really</br>   smart—well for me, they were actually really smart. So I always try to time</br>   to listen to what they say, and they always tell us like, &quot;Guys, please</br>   don't get pregnant because you have a lot of life. First you have to finish</br>   your career, and all of that, and then you can get pregnant.&quot; So I listen a</br>   lot the experiences and advices.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You said you went to a bilingual school. Was it a public school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was a public school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Public, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was called, well it's called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Benito Juarez</span>. That was my high</br>   school, and my elementary school was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Pickard Elementary School</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. And your brother also, you know, we also hear that the</br>   young men, like your brother, often end up in gangs and criminal</br>   activities.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, no he doesn't do any gangs. But, well I believe that he</br>   listens a lot to my mom. She's always like, &quot;Learn from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>.</br>   Look, they don't have any children.&quot; Or, &quot;Look, they are not in gangs.&quot; And</br>   we're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Because she was like, &quot;If you really want to be</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, act like an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>.&quot; And we try our best to not get caught by</br>   the -“migra”- so we are always like, &quot;No, be careful. No, don't do this.&quot;</br>   Well, things happen.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yes. I don't think I have any more questions, but is there something</br>   you would like to share to the people who might listen to this interview</br>   that you might not have said thus far that tells us more about you, your</br>   experiences as a returning migrant, anything at all?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, when I returned to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, it was really complicated. When I</br>   returned in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> they didn't have those programs. I already told to the</br>   other girl, and I tell her like, this is the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> program in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about seven   years</span> that I found that actually got interest in immigrants like us. If I</br>   would find a program that actually support you for being an immigrant or</br>   something like that, I will take it. But I didn't know if you were</br>   bilingual you get paid more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I actually learned that when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">25, 24-years-old</span>, and that was</br>   like when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five years later</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. If they had more programs that</br>   supported immigrants, that would be great. If they give them like the</br>   support because it's really complicated. It's a cultural shock. You are in</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> and they have a perspective of everything and when you get into</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, it is complicated.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: They do not accept you because you were living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. They were</br>   like, &quot;Oh you chose to get into the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>? Go back.&quot; Some of those comments,</br>   so it's really a shock. They should put more programs that support</br>   immigrants in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What kind of programs do you think?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Like this one, like they help you to look for a job. They provide</br>   you more information because I didn't know that you had to certify your</br>   certificates from high school and all your transcripts before you can be</br>   here. So, it was complicated because I have to send the transcript from my</br>   school to my mom, so she can get them certified in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>, and then go</br>   back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Those kind of programs that inform you about those issues</br>   or re-integrate you in the culture on the population in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, or</br>   something. I don't know. Those kind of programs.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up to Interview</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anne: Tell us why the university of Chicago only gave you a full</br>   scholarship for one semester.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: What I was telling you before is that, to get any scholarship or to</br>   get into university, if you don't have any social security number, you</br>   cannot get into college. So what I did high school, I didn't tell anyone</br>   about my status because I was really afraid to get deported. So basically I</br>   put a fake social security number in my... How do you say that? My forms?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Application.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: My applications, yeah. I put a play social security number in my</br>   applications. That's the reason that they accept me. But when they find out</br>   that I was undocumented, well, they only provide me with a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one semester</span></br>   scholarship. That's the reason that I only studied for one semester in</br>   university of Chicago.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah, when I was in high school, I was really smart, so, well, not</br>   that smart, but the school told me that I can skip <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span> if I wanted. So</br>   they skipped me one year because I was really, well, I was having a lot of</br>   A's in all the classes. I was exceeding in all the classes, so they skipped</br>   me from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">sophomore year</span> to senior year. So I didn't go into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">junior year</span>, and</br>   when they skipped me, I didn't know what to do. It was too soon for me. So,</br>   that's one of the reasons that I decided to use that fake number. I didn't</br>   tell my mom, either, because she was going to be mad at me. She was going</br>   to have to be like, &quot;Hey, why are you doing that? You know that it's</br>   illegal.&quot; But come on, we were illegal already.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So your school didn't help you. They must have known that you were</br>   undocumented there at high school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: They did know that we were undocumented and I have a counselor that</br>   she was trying her best, but they tried to help me. They actually gave me a</br>   scholarship to purchase my books. They gave me $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">1,000</span>, some scholarship,</br>   but it was a need required scholarship [inaudible. But for some reason it</br>   was not enough. I went to live on the campus, but it was not enough with</br>   that scholarship.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: But they didn't advise you as you were applying for colleges about</br>   your undocumented status and how to deal with that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, they didn't. They tried to guide me to apply to the scholarship.</br>   Well, I mean this school, but they don't have that much undocumented people</br>   in high school, and when they are undocumented, they don't actually like to</br>   study in school. Most of them don't like to go to college or they realize</br>   that there aren't able to study in college.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you were sort of an anomaly. They didn't know what to do with you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Economic">Laura: Okay. When I went to the U.S., I was 12 years old approximately. I'm   right now 26 years old. I used to live on Iguala Guerrero, and if you know,   Guerrero is one of the poorest states in Mexico.     Laura: So we were really struggling with a lot of payments. Sometimes we   didn't have anything to eat. We ate tacos, and that was all we ate in a   whole day. So the education was pretty bad. Sometimes we went to school or   sometimes we didn't because, well, we didn't have money to go to the   school.     Laura: My mom was getting paid well, a really low wage. She was getting   paid about 700 pesos per week. That's about ... I'm not sure. Is that $35   per week]? We were struggling a lot. When we went to the US, we're trying   to look for better living, having to eat something. I don't know. Like, a   lifestyle, a proper lifestyle.    </span> Anne: Do you remember the crossing?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I do remember it. Well, I'm afraid of mice. So, when we</br>   crossed the border, it was actually really awkward for me because we went</br>   into a tunnel. It was really dark, though.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So, when we went through the tunnel, I remember it was pretty dark.</br>   We have a lot of mice on our feet and snakes. Oh my god, even if you have</br>   the eyes open you cannot see anything because everything was dark. The</br>   coyote was telling us not to make any noises. I was like, “I want to scream</br>   because I'm feeling the mice on my feet. I just want to scream and say, ‘Oh</br>   my god,’ or ‘Ah,’ something, but I couldn't.”</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My brother, when we crossed the border—my mom has already been in</br>   the US for one year, so we crossed the border by ourselves]—when we went</br>   with the coyote, he was like, &quot;Do not make any noises. We're going to</br>   walk.” I don't remember how much we walk. We were pretty tired. We can only</br>   carry one bottle of water and we have already taken all, and when we cross</br>   the whole border, there was a car. It was waiting for us. We went to the</br>   car, they put a bandage in our eyes so we don't see the road.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: The coyote was always telling us to not make any noises because the</br>   border patrol was going to get us caught. I do remember everything like the</br>   experience was yesterday. So, when we got in the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it was just you, and your brother, and the coyote?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: And the coyote?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That was it?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, it was me, my brother, the coyote, and another three people.</br>   It was a partner: the kid, one kid, and another, a man. We were like five</br>   people, six, seven people. Kind of remember—it was a long time ago. My mom</br>   was not there because we went by ourselves. She was already in the US so</br>   she pay to get us into the other side. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did your father come, too?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: We didn't live with our father. He was really an alcoholic, crazy,</br>   alcoholic man. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you leave behind relatives and friends? Was it hard to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was really hard. It was complicated because my grandmother was</br>   really sick. So when we left her, she was really sick and she died one</br>   month later. So it was really sad. My friends, we left them behind. We</br>   never talk once. Once we been to the US we have never talk since, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's sad. So did your mom eventually meet you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where did she meet you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: In Chicago. She's living right now in Chicago, so we met her in</br>   Chicago as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that was a long trip on your own.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, it was a long trip. We did it. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Must've been good to see her.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was amazing, yeah. She was working and the coyote told us that</br>   she was working. Since we were the last two people with the coyote, the</br>   coyote took us to our mom. She was in a restaurant because she work as a</br>   waitress. And when we got there, she was crying. She was actually carrying</br>   dishes and the dishes just fall because she was really impressed. We</br>   haven't seen her in one year so she was really impressed and she drop all</br>   the dishes. We were all crying, you know. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. That's great. Did the US seem strange to you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was strange at first. Well, it was too big for us, you know?</br>   Iguala is really small, our city was really small. Chicago is such a huge</br>   city. The buildings are really amazing, so I remember that we were really</br>   impressed. We couldn't believe that we were in the U.S.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So we went in the Chicago in October, so it was really beautiful</br>   because the trees has those leaves color red, and some of the trees doesn't</br>   have any leaves, so it was really cool. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your brother older or younger?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He's younger. When we went to the US, I was 12 and he was 10,</br>   approximately.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, we learned in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did. How did you learn?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I learned by myself because back in the time, there was no ESL</br>   classes. So, when we went to Chicago, my mom took the time to get us into a</br>   bilingual school. And in the bilingual school, some of the classes were in</br>   Spanish and others in English, and I learn by hearing my classmates. And</br>   the teacher was always like, &quot;Hey do this,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;What?&quot; And he</br>   pointed at what I had to do, so I learned by seeing and hearing.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So no ESL?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No ESL. Until high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what grade did you start?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I started on seventh grade. Yeah, it was seven grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you didn't lose any time in school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, we didn't. Well, my brother, he was in fifth grade so he started</br>   in fifth grade and I started in seventh, so we didn't lose any timeframe.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take to feel comfortable in English?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Oh my god, I still don't feel confident because we have a lot of</br>   bully when we start to talk in English. The kids were like making fun of us</br>   because we didn't have any good English of course. They were like Americans</br>   so they were basically always bullying us because we were not American. So</br>   that was one of the, how do you say, the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The barriers?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: The barriers, yeah. The barriers, took us more time to learn</br>   English. Yeah it was actually pretty complicated. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: At first it was awkward. I didn't want to go to school because the</br>   kids were all making bully. They were all bullies. I actually got into a</br>   fight about two times because the kids were always making fun of us, that</br>   we were like Mexicans. But after that, in high school, it got better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah I did, a lot. [Chuckles]. But in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were they from all different?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I actually have a lot of friends. I have a Muslim friend</br>   actually. They were all different cultures because I went to a bilingual</br>   school as well, a bilingual high school. Most of my friends were Americans</br>   so they didn't know I was undocumented and I didn't tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know all along that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I did. But, my brother, he took a lot of more time to realize</br>   that we were not Americans because when he went to the US, he was really a</br>   kid, so he didn't realize that it was illegal. [chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your mother learn English, too?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She tried, but it was a little more complicated for her because</br>   there are no programs that support those kinds of like, to learn English</br>   undocumented. She's afraid that if she got into one of those programs, the</br>   ICE is going to get her caught, so that's why.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, she was afraid?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she was afraid.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she work a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She did work a lot in a restaurant. Right now, she's manager of a</br>   restaurant. She's the manager but she did a lot of work. She was never</br>   around the house because she has to work a lot. She was always saying that,</br>   &quot;If I came to America it's to get you in school, and to always have money</br>   so we don't end back in Mexico.&quot; That was her idea.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, then you became the mother of your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, kind of. I was always taking care of him. I teach him how to</br>   cook, or how to make the stuff. Basically, I learn from my mom, but my</br>   brother learn from me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did school compare to the schooling that you'd had in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was actually better, the education. I afraid to tell this, but</br>   the education is better in America than in Mexico. We have a lot of sports,</br>   we have the art classes, and in Mexico we didn't have any of those. We only</br>   have Spanish and math, and that's it. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you did well in school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did. I actually went into the honors roll. When I graduated from</br>   high school, I graduate as top 10 and I graduate as number three in my</br>   generation. I earned a scholarship to get into the University of Chicago,</br>   but it was only for one semester and I couldn't pay the whole career.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you got a scholarship to the University of Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. For one semester?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: For one semester?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you go?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I try, but since I have to work and I have to go to school, I</br>   couldn't manage that. It was too much for me. I couldn't. It was too much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you didn't even try, I mean you did not go—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did one semester, but the rest of that I couldn't because I didn't</br>   have any money. My family needed the money, so I try to help my mom, but</br>   ... well it was not enough. The school in America's really expensive.</br>   [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you enjoy college?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: The only one semester I went, yeah, I did. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what were you hoping to do with college?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was trying to get into the medical school. I was in liberal arts</br>   of science, but I changed my mind and I wanted to get into the medical</br>   school, but I couldn't. It was a lot of money. We didn't have any money. We</br>   did have money to get into the basics, but we didn't have enough to pay my</br>   school of course.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when you stopped college, what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I work, because-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I work as a waitress. We use fake social security numbers to get</br>   into job. I used to work at Chili's, I used to work at Discovery. I never</br>   work at McDonald's, but my brother did. Most of the time I worked as a</br>   waitress to get money to start paying my school once again, but I realize</br>   that it was too complicated. So, then I move off to Mexico. Well, it was</br>   complicated, too. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your brother also graduate from high school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He did. He did graduate from high school. He got DACA, but he didn't</br>   use the DACA. Like he only work at factories because the social security</br>   number was the legal one, however, he didn't want to study.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when you were at the University of Chicago, did you learn about</br>   DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: When I was in the University, I was approximately 17 years old, kind</br>   of. Like 17 or 18. I didn't learn about DACA until I was voluntary</br>   deported. So when I get into Mexico, one day later, they approve DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And when was that? What year?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: 2011, 2010? I don't remember quite well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, 2011 maybe.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: 2011 or something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It started in 2012.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, and I was really upset because it was one day later. Like,</br>   come on. [Chuckles]. I was waiting like my whole life to be legal. When</br>   they basically give all the people that went into the US as children the</br>   DACA, I was pretty upset. Like, what? I was in depression. Totally</br>   depression, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you were working as a waitress?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a boyfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. I used to have a boyfriend in high school and that was the only</br>   one. He was American. He study at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of</br>   Technology].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: MIT?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, so when he went to the MIT we have to broke out because</br>   actually, well you know.[Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He was really focused on his career. I want to focus on my career as</br>   well so we broke up. That was the only boyfriend that I remember. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you had voluntary departure. So, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I got caught driving without any license. Well, I was told that if I</br>   voluntary departure from the US, I wouldn't be in any trouble. So, I did</br>   what it was best for me because we went to a lawyer and that's what the</br>   lawyer suggest. So, that was six months, the timeframe that the judge gave</br>   me to leave the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you got caught driving without a license? Was there an infraction</br>   or did you just get pulled over for…?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I got pulled over. Well, they didn't tell me. They tell me that I</br>   haven't made the five second stop or something like that, but I did, but</br>   they say that I didn't. So, when the police find out that I didn't have any</br>   driver's license, he asked me about my status. I told him that it was</br>   illegal to ask about the status, but they tell me that if I was illegal</br>   they will have to call ICE on me. I was like, &quot;Come on, please don't do</br>   that.&quot; And, of course, I was begging for not to call ICE. So, they find out</br>   that I was illegal. So, basically—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They called ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They called ICE.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said a lawyer told you to listen to...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, we talked to a lawyer. Well, I was having my judge</br>   appointment, like my court, but the lawyer tell me that if I voluntary</br>   departure, I didn't have to go through all of that because if they deport</br>   me, will be worse for me. So, I went to voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how long did that take?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They took about six months, approximately.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And were you in detention or were you at home?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was in home but I have the little thingy, the, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had an ankle bracelet.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, ankle. I was like, &quot;Come on.&quot; [Chuckle]. Why?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. So, when you left, where were you going to go? Did you</br>   have a plan?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, we didn't have a plan, but we started to plan it when the</br>   circumstances got worse. So, my mom tell me that if I want to get my</br>   education, I will have to do it by myself here in Mexico. So when I got in</br>   here, it was complicated. It was complicated, but I kind of feel good.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: But it was really, Oh my god, the separation, all of that. I felt it</br>   like, “Come on. Why?” Sometimes I felt like life was really unfair. When I</br>   got in the Mexico, what I have in my mind was to study, not to let my</br>   studies go for a deportation or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: With the voluntary departure did they tell you, you could go back to</br>   the US after a certain amount of time?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, they told me that actually. But when I got in here, I wait</br>   about three, four years, then I apply for a scholarship for Rochester</br>   University and they give me the scholarship for one semester and they gave</br>   me a visa for that, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, are you going?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I already went. [Chuckles]. I was studying nuclear physics, so they</br>   give me a scholarship for math school there is on Rochester University. So,</br>   I took it. It was my opportunity to get a visa, so I took the visa and I</br>   went to Rochester for one semester, and, of course, I went to Chicago as</br>   well. [Chuckle]. I went to see my family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, are you going to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: To the US?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To finish up your—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, the scholarship was from my school. I went to the Politécnico</br>   [Instituto Politécnico Nacional]. So, it was like—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like a study abroad?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, study abroad. So, they gave me that opportunity, so I took it.</br>   I didn't think twice. I had the opportunity to go to that school or to go</br>   to Japan, so I took it to the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you have the opportunity to travel to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I have. Well, when I went to the visa interview, they actually</br>   asked me about my status and I did say the truth. They didn't tell me</br>   anything about it, so they give me the visa. So, I don't know how the laws</br>   work but they give me the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, let's go back to coming back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you transported by ICE to the border?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, I pay my own transportation because the lawyer just tell me that</br>   I have to do it. I didn't question the lawyer. I know that, well if you are</br>   a lawyer, you have to know about laws. It was provided by one of the</br>   Mexicans. It was a program in the US that... well it was only for immigrant</br>   women.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So, when my mom went to the program, and they tell her that they</br>   have this good lawyer and all of that. Well, the lawyer recommend me to go</br>   back to Mexico and do not get anything from ICE because if I do have to do</br>   it, it will be worse. So, I went here by bus. So we only took the bus and</br>   that's it. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you landed, or you came right to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well from the bus, it was from Chicago to Nuevo Laredo. The bus got</br>   into Nuevo Laredo. I have to look for the bus central to get into Mexico</br>   City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had family here?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. I didn't have anyone. Well, as I mentioned before, my</br>   grandmother has already died so we didn't have any kind of relatives that</br>   were that important. So, when I got into here, I went by myself. I have a</br>   friend in here that I met from the internet, so I asked that friend to let</br>   me stay at his home and he allow me to stay on his home. So, basically, I</br>   have to trust in someone that I didn't knew, but I had met him since I was</br>   like 13 years old when I start using the internet so I have to trust him.</br>   [Chuckles]. He helped me to look for a job at a bakery, so that was all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, the whole idea was you're going to come back and you're going</br>   to try and continue your studies? So how did that go?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: At first, it didn't go pretty well because my Spanish was horrible.</br>   Right now, my English is horrible but later, back in the time, my Spanish</br>   was horrible, so I had to learn. I save a lot of money to pay a school to</br>   get regularization—it was for learning how to write and how to speak</br>   properly. So, I took that course. I tried to do my test for getting to the</br>   UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico), but I couldn't. My Spanish</br>   was still horrible. My reading was horrible. So, I had to adapt once again</br>   to learn Spanish.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did that take?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: That took about six months probably? Or one year because I have to</br>   work, too. Here in Mexico, they do the test every six months, so I have to</br>   wait until I have learned very well. So, when I learn, once again, I did</br>   the test to get into the UNAM or to the Politécnico. I started on both</br>   school but I went to the Politécnico to study nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To study—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And are you still doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I have to finish my tests but I'm almost finished.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when did you start?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I started back in 2011, 2012? Don't remember pretty well. My mother</br>   tried to help me with money, but sometimes it was not enough for me because</br>   I have to pay my bills, and she didn't know about Mexico. She believes that</br>   it's cheaper than in the US. It is kind of cheaper—well it's not that much</br>   cheaper. I have to pay my rent, my bills, and all of that. So, basically, I</br>   started to work, and I study in the school as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you were doing part time?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, in that timeframe, I was doing part time. Right now, I work in</br>   a full job.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you're trying to finish your undergraduate degree? Is that what</br>   you're trying to finish right now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, my undergraduate degree.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: In nuclear physics and I started that second career, economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A second—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, a second career on economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so, when you graduate, you'll have a major in both?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then what? What will you do then?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, right now, what I want to do is work in the government. Well</br>   my goal in life is to do the kind of like—you know when the President is</br>   speaking, someone writes those announcements and all of that? I want to do</br>   that. I want to write for the President, so he can deliver them. I don't</br>   know how you say that in English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A speech writer.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: A speech writer, yeah for the President, or for the government,</br>   yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So, what kind of job do you have now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Right now, I work in a call center for Best Buy. I do the City Bank</br>   for credit cards actually. So, I work for the City Bank and they pay pretty</br>   well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But graduating from college, once you get your degree, will you look</br>   for a more...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I'm thinking about it because here in Mexico, the business of the</br>   science is not that good. In the US, they really try to get people to get</br>   interested in science, but in Mexico they don't even have a nuclear plant.</br>   So, where can I apply my career?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So that's why I started to study economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, will you have to get another degree in order to do what you want</br>   to do?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I will have to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, once you graduate, will you apply to school again?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Once I finish my economics, I will start a masters, if</br>   possible a PhD. In English I think it's PhD, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So right now, you've finished classwork and you need to pass tests?</br>   Is that right?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Well, my day is like, I go to work and when I finish working</br>   about 3:00— I start my day at 7:00 AM at my job, and I finish at 3:00,—and</br>   later I go to school 5:00 to 9 o'clock, and I got into my house until 11:00</br>   and I have to sleep, and then back again.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It's complicated, but you get used to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: By myself.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I really miss them. Well, when I have money ... right now, I have my</br>   visa, so ... On December, I earned a scholarship to get into economics</br>   school in Japan, so I went to Japan last year. And I got the time to go to</br>   see my family too. So, I just saw them in December.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see, I see. So, your mother's still working?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she's still working right now. She was a waitress but now</br>   she's the manager of the restaurant so she's pretty lucky. And my brother,</br>   he has DACA, but he is working in a factory for salsas. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were in the US, what were your dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I really wanted to be a doctor, but in Mexico… Oh my god, I really</br>   tried to be a doctor here, but it was complicated because most of the what</br>   is required in here to be a doctor is complicated. You need a lot of money</br>   to be a doctor. So, well, money again. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, your dreams have changed?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Right now, yeah I have a lot of different goals. More</br>   tangible, more realistic goals, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think you'll meet them?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I believe it because well I deserve it now. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My family. I really like the winter in Chicago, the snow, you know?</br>   It's really cold. I really like to be in Chicago, but the circumstances. It</br>   was complicated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So do you think that you are different having been to the US for</br>   those years? How did it change you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They changed me. I believe if I have stayed here in Mexico, probably</br>   I would never learn English. Probably, I would not have the opportunity</br>   that I have right now to travel to any other places because I like to</br>   travel a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So, when I try to compare myself with my friends, with my friends</br>   that we left in Iguala, what I see is that they didn't have the opportunity</br>   that I have, like to learn things, to meet some new culture, to meet</br>   people. Like they didn't have that opportunity. They stayed in that place,</br>   and they were absorbed by the violence, by the narco traffic, and</br>   everything. What I think is that I was really lucky. Kind of lucky because</br>   some things got complicated, but some things were really an experience, and</br>   they were a nice experience.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I learn a lot from people from the US. They have a different</br>   culture, a different, like, you know, thinking. They don't think poorly.</br>   Always one more, and in Mexico we don't have that mentality.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you say, think one more, think...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Like, they are always out of the box—like you for your project. You</br>   are always out of the box. In Mexico, people is really closed-minded. Like,</br>   they believe that if you were born poor, you will stay poor. And I believe</br>   that's not true because what I learn in America is that if you want more,</br>   you can have it, but you have to work for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you one of the smartest kids in your classes before you left</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were always really smart?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, when I was in Mexico, it was one of the smartest one, and when</br>   I went to the US, when I learned the language, I was one of the smartest</br>   one, well, kind of.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you don't think that being one of the smartest ones in Mexico</br>   would have gotten you out?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. No, I believe that probably I will be absorbed by violence, too.</br>   Probably I would dead or something like that. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when we talk to young women about your age who grew up primarily</br>   in the U.S.—though you had a mixed childhood—a lot of them end up getting</br>   pregnant at really young ages, at 14 or 15.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And I just wanted you to reflect on that, and why that might happen,</br>   and why it was different for you.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I'm not sure why. [laughs] Maybe the education. When I went to the</br>   US, I always have a good education programs. They teach you how to use</br>   condoms and all of that now. I admire my teachers a lot. They were really</br>   smart—well for me, they were actually really smart. So I always try to time</br>   to listen to what they say, and they always tell us like, &quot;Guys, please</br>   don't get pregnant because you have a lot of life. First you have to finish</br>   your career, and all of that, and then you can get pregnant.&quot; So I listen a</br>   lot the experiences and advices.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said you went to a bilingual school. Was it a public school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was a public school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was called, well it's called Benito Juarez. That was my high</br>   school, and my elementary school was Pickard Elementary School.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. And your brother also, you know, we also hear that the</br>   young men, like your brother, often end up in gangs and criminal</br>   activities.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, no he doesn't do any gangs. But, well I believe that he</br>   listens a lot to my mom. She's always like, &quot;Learn from the Americans.</br>   Look, they don't have any children.&quot; Or, &quot;Look, they are not in gangs.&quot; And</br>   we're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Because she was like, &quot;If you really want to be</br>   American, act like an American.&quot; And we try our best to not get caught by</br>   the -“migra”- so we are always like, &quot;No, be careful. No, don't do this.&quot;</br>   Well, things happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes. I don't think I have any more questions, but is there something</br>   you would like to share to the people who might listen to this interview</br>   that you might not have said thus far that tells us more about you, your</br>   experiences as a returning migrant, anything at all?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, when I returned to Mexico, it was really complicated. When I</br>   returned in Mexico they didn't have those programs. I already told to the</br>   other girl, and I tell her like, this is the first program in about seven</br>   years that I found that actually got interest in immigrants like us. If I</br>   would find a program that actually support you for being an immigrant or</br>   something like that, I will take it. But I didn't know if you were</br>   bilingual you get paid more.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I actually learned that when I was 25, 24-years-old, and that was</br>   like when I was five years later in Mexico. If they had more programs that</br>   supported immigrants, that would be great. If they give them like the</br>   support because it's really complicated. It's a cultural shock. You are in</br>   the U.S. and they have a perspective of everything and when you get into</br>   Mexico, it is complicated.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They do not accept you because you were living in the US. They were</br>   like, &quot;Oh you chose to get into the US? Go back.&quot; Some of those comments,</br>   so it's really a shock. They should put more programs that support</br>   immigrants in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What kind of programs do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Like this one, like they help you to look for a job. They provide</br>   you more information because I didn't know that you had to certify your</br>   certificates from high school and all your transcripts before you can be</br>   here. So, it was complicated because I have to send the transcript from my</br>   school to my mom, so she can get them certified in the U.S., and then go</br>   back to Mexico. Those kind of programs that inform you about those issues</br>   or re-integrate you in the culture on the population in Mexico, or</br>   something. I don't know. Those kind of programs.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up to Interview</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="College, Higher Education, Fear of, Academic, Immigration status, Living undocumented, Hiding/lying, Documents">Anne: Tell us why the university of Chicago only gave you a full   scholarship for one semester.     Laura: What I was telling you before is that, to get any scholarship or to   get into university, if you don't have any social security number, you   cannot get into college. So what I did high school, I didn't tell anyone   about my status because I was really afraid to get deported. So basically I   put a fake social security number in my... How do you say that? My forms?     Anne: Application.     Laura: My applications, yeah. I put a play social security number in my   applications. That's the reason that they accept me. But when they find out   that I was undocumented, well, they only provide me with a one semester   scholarship. That's the reason that I only studied for one semester in   university of Chicago.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Policy for reintegration, Language, Jobs, School, Social acceptance,  Reform">Anne: Yes.

I really like the winter in Chicago, the snow, you know?   It's really cold. I really like to be in Chicago, but the circumstances. It   was complicated.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Dreams">Anne: When you were in the US, what were your dreams?     Laura: I really wanted to be a doctor, but in Mexico… Oh my god, I really   tried to be a doctor here, but it was complicated because most of the what   is required in here to be a doctor is complicated. You need a lot of money   to be a doctor. So, well, money again. [Chuckles]     Anne: So, your dreams have changed?     Laura: Yeah. Right now, yeah I have a lot of different goals. More   tangible, more realistic goals, yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Dreams,  careers">Anne: And then what? What will you do then?     Laura: Well, right now, what I want to do is work in the government. Well   my goal in life is to do the kind of like—you know when the President is   speaking, someone writes those announcements and all of that? I want to do   that. I want to write for the President, so he can deliver them. I don't   know how you say that in English.     Anne: A speech writer.

So how did that go?     Laura: At first, it didn't go pretty well because my Spanish was horrible.   Right now, my English is horrible but later, back in the time, my Spanish   was horrible, so I had to learn. I save a lot of money to pay a school to   get regularization—it was for learning how to write and how to speak   properly. So, I took that course. I tried to do my test for getting to the   UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico), but I couldn't. My Spanish   was still horrible. My reading was horrible. So, I had to adapt once again   to learn Spanish.     Anne: How long did that take?     Laura: That took about six months probably? Or one year because I have to   work, too. Here in Mexico, they do the test every six months, so I have to   wait until I have learned very well. So, when I learn, once again, I did   the test to get into the UNAM or to the Politécnico. I started on both   school but I went to the Politécnico to study nuclear physics.     Anne: To study—     Laura: Nuclear physics.     Anne: And are you still doing that?     Laura: I have to finish my tests but I'm almost finished.     Anne: So, when did you start?     Laura: I started back in 2011, 2012? Don't remember pretty well. My mother   tried to help me with money, but sometimes it was not enough for me because   I have to pay my bills, and she didn't know about Mexico. She believes that   it's cheaper than in the US. It is kind of cheaper—well it's not that much   cheaper. I have to pay my rent, my bills, and all of that. So, basically, I   started to work, and I study in the school as well.     Anne: So, you were doing part time?     Laura: Well, in that timeframe, I was doing part time. Right now, I work in   a full job.     Anne: So, you're trying to finish your undergraduate degree? Is that what   you're trying to finish right now?     Laura: Yeah, my undergraduate degree.     Anne: In nuclear physics.     Laura: In nuclear physics and I started that second career, economics.     Anne: A second—     Laura: Yeah, a second career on economics.     Anne: And so, when you graduate, you'll have a major in both?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Ice, Treatment by, Lawyer, Court Proceedings, Paying For, Voluntary Departure, Fear, Return to Mexico">Anne: Were you transported by ICE to the border?     Laura: No, I pay my own transportation because the lawyer just tell me that   I have to do it. I didn't question the lawyer. I know that, well if you are   a lawyer, you have to know about laws. It was provided by one of the   Mexicans. It was a program in the US that... well it was only for immigrant   women.     Laura: So, when my mom went to the program, and they tell her that they   have this good lawyer and all of that. Well, the lawyer recommend me to go   back to Mexico and do not get anything from ICE because if I do have to do   it, it will be worse. So, I went here by bus. So we only took the bus and   that's it. [Chuckle].     Anne: And you landed, or you came right to Mexico City?     Laura: Well from the bus, it was from Chicago to Nuevo Laredo. The bus got   into Nuevo Laredo. I have to look for the bus central to get into Mexico   City.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Continuing education, College, Mexico, Academic">Anne: With the voluntary departure did they tell you, you could go back to   the US after a certain amount of time?     Laura: Yeah, they told me that actually. But when I got in here, I wait   about three, four years, then I apply for a scholarship for Rochester   University and they give me the scholarship for one semester and they gave   me a visa for that, so.     Anne: So, are you going?     Laura: I already went. [Chuckles]. I was studying nuclear physics, so they   give me a scholarship for math school there is on Rochester University. So,   I took it. It was my opportunity to get a visa, so I took the visa and I   went to Rochester for one semester, and, of course, I went to Chicago as   well. [Chuckle]. I went to see my family.     Anne: So, are you going to go back?     Laura: To the US?     Anne: To finish up your—     Laura: No, the scholarship was from my school. I went to the Politécnico   [Instituto Politécnico Nacional]. So, it was like—     Anne: Like a study abroad?     Laura: Yeah, study abroad. So, they gave me that opportunity, so I took it.   I didn't think twice. I had the opportunity to go to that school or to go   to Japan, so I took it to the US.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Continuing education, Feelings, Sadness, Isolation,  anxiety, Sadness, Education, College">o, my mom tell me that if I want to get my   education, I will have to do it by myself here in Mexico. So when I got in   here, it was complicated. It was complicated, but I kind of feel good.     Laura: But it was really, Oh my god, the separation, all of that. I felt it   like, “Come on. Why?” Sometimes I felt like life was really unfair. When I   got in the Mexico, what I have in my mind was to study, not to let my   studies go for a deportation or something like that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Arrests, Traffic Offenses, Driver’s license, Police: US, Treatment by, Ice, Immigration Offenses, Lawyer, Court Proceedings, Paying For, Voluntary Departure">Anne: So, you said you had voluntary departure. So, what happened?     Laura: I got caught driving without any license. Well, I was told that if I   voluntary departure from the US, I wouldn't be in any trouble. So, I did   what it was best for me because we went to a lawyer and that's what the   lawyer suggest. So, that was six months, the timeframe that the judge gave   me to leave the US.     Anne: So, you got caught driving without a license? Was there an infraction   or did you just get pulled over for…?     Laura: I got pulled over. Well, they didn't tell me. They tell me that I   haven't made the five second stop or something like that, but I did, but   they say that I didn't. So, when the police find out that I didn't have any   driver's license, he asked me about my status. I told him that it was   illegal to ask about the status, but they tell me that if I was illegal   they will have to call ICE on me. I was like, &quot;Come on, please don't do   that.&quot; And, of course, I was begging for not to call ICE. So, they find out   that I was illegal. So, basically—     Anne: They called ICE?     Laura: They called ICE.     Anne: And you said a lawyer told you to listen to...?     Laura: Yeah, we talked to a lawyer. Well, I was having my judge   appointment, like my court, but the lawyer tell me that if I voluntary   departure, I didn't have to go through all of that because if they deport   me, will be worse for me. So, I went to voluntary departure.     Anne: And how long did that take?     Laura: They took about six months, approximately.     Anne: And were you in detention or were you at home?     Laura: I was in home but I have the little thingy, the, I don't know.     Anne: You had an ankle bracelet.     Laura: Yeah, ankle. I was like, &quot;Come on.&quot; [Chuckle]. Why?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DACA, Eligibility, Immigration status, Lost opportunities, Broken system">Laura: He did. He did graduate from high school. He got DACA, but he didn't   use the DACA. Like he only work at factories because the social security   number was the legal one, however, he didn't want to study.     Anne: So, when you were at the University of Chicago, did you learn about   DACA?     Laura: When I was in the University, I was approximately 17 years old, kind   of. Like 17 or 18. I didn't learn about DACA until I was voluntary   deported. So when I get into Mexico, one day later, they approve DACA.     Anne: And when was that? What year?     Laura: 2011, 2010? I don't remember quite well.     Anne: Yeah, 2011 maybe.     Laura: 2011 or something.     Anne: It started in 2012.     Laura: Yeah, and I was really upset because it was one day later. Like,   come on. [Chuckles]. I was waiting like my whole life to be legal. When   they basically give all the people that went into the US as children the   DACA, I was pretty upset. Like, what? I was in depression. Totally   depression, yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Working, Documents, Social security card/ ID, Earnings, Higher Education, Paying For">Anne: Where do you work?

Laura: I try, but since I have to work and I have to go to school, I   couldn't manage that. It was too much for me. I couldn't. It was too much.     Anne: So, you didn't even try, I mean you did not go—     Laura: I did one semester, but the rest of that I couldn't because I didn't   have any money. My family needed the money, so I try to help my mom, but   ... well it was not enough. The school in America's really expensive.   [Chuckles]     Anne: Did you enjoy college?     Laura: The only one semester I went, yeah, I did. [Chuckles].     Anne: And what were you hoping to do with college?     Laura: I was trying to get into the medical school. I was in liberal arts   of science, but I changed my mind and I wanted to get into the medical   school, but I couldn't. It was a lot of money. We didn't have any money.

Laura: It was actually better, the education. I afraid to tell this, but   the education is better in America than in Mexico. We have a lot of sports,   we have the art classes, and in Mexico we didn't have any of those. We only   have Spanish and math, and that's it.

She was never   around the house because she has to work a lot. She was always saying that,   &quot;If I came to America it's to get you in school, and to always have money   so we don't end back in Mexico.&quot; That was her idea.     Anne: So, then you became the mother of your brother?     Laura: Yeah, kind of. I was always taking care of him. I teach him how to   cook, or how to make the stuff.

Anne: Did you know all along that you were undocumented?     Laura: Yeah, I did. But, my brother, he took a lot of more time to realize   that we were not Americans because when he went to the US, he was really a   kid, so he didn't realize that it was illegal. [chuckles]     Anne: Did your mother learn English, too?     Laura: She tried, but it was a little more complicated for her because   there are no programs that support those kinds of like, to learn English   undocumented. She's afraid that if she got into one of those programs, the   ICE is going to get her caught, so that's why.     Anne: So, she was afraid?     Laura: Yeah, she was afraid.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, Elementary, High school, Discrimination, Bullying, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out">Anne: How long did it take to feel comfortable in English?     Laura: Oh my god, I still don't feel confident because we have a lot of   bully when we start to talk in English. The kids were like making fun of us   because we didn't have any good English of course. They were like Americans   so they were basically always bullying us because we were not American. So   that was one of the, how do you say, the—     Anne: The barriers?     Laura: The barriers, yeah. The barriers, took us more time to learn   English. Yeah it was actually pretty complicated. [Chuckles].     Anne: How was school?     Laura: At first it was awkward. I didn't want to go to school because the   kids were all making bully. They were all bullies. I actually got into a   fight about two times because the kids were always making fun of us, that   we were like Mexicans.

That's great. Did the US seem strange to you?     Laura: It was strange at first. Well, it was too big for us, you know?   Iguala is really small, our city was really small. Chicago is such a huge   city. The buildings are really amazing, so I remember that we were really   impressed. We couldn't believe that we were in the U.S.     Laura: So we went in the Chicago in October, so it was really beautiful   because the trees has those leaves color red, and some of the trees doesn't   have any leaves, so it was really cool.

Was it hard to leave?     Laura: It was really hard. It was complicated because my grandmother was   really sick. So when we left her, she was really sick and she died one   month later. So it was really sad. My friends, we left them behind. We   never talk once. Once we been to the US we have never talk since, so.     Anne: That's sad. So did your mom eventually meet you?     Laura: Yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexican childhood, Memories, Family">Laura: Okay. When I went to the U.S., I was 12 years old approximately. I'm   right now 26 years old. I used to live on Iguala Guerrero, and if you know,   Guerrero is one of the poorest states in Mexico.     Laura: So we were really struggling with a lot of payments. Sometimes we   didn't have anything to eat. We ate tacos, and that was all we ate in a   whole day. So the education was pretty bad. Sometimes we went to school or   sometimes we didn't because, well, we didn't have money to go to the   school.     Laura: My mom was getting paid well, a really low wage. She was getting   paid about 700 pesos per week. That's about ... I'm not sure. Is that $35   per week]? We were struggling a lot. When we went to the US, we're trying   to look for better living, having to eat something. I don't know. Like, a   lifestyle, a proper lifestyle.    </span> Anne: Do you remember the crossing?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I do remember it. Well, I'm afraid of mice. So, when we</br>   crossed the border, it was actually really awkward for me because we went</br>   into a tunnel. It was really dark, though.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So, when we went through the tunnel, I remember it was pretty dark.</br>   We have a lot of mice on our feet and snakes. Oh my god, even if you have</br>   the eyes open you cannot see anything because everything was dark. The</br>   coyote was telling us not to make any noises. I was like, “I want to scream</br>   because I'm feeling the mice on my feet. I just want to scream and say, ‘Oh</br>   my god,’ or ‘Ah,’ something, but I couldn't.”</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My brother, when we crossed the border—my mom has already been in</br>   the US for one year, so we crossed the border by ourselves]—when we went</br>   with the coyote, he was like, &quot;Do not make any noises. We're going to</br>   walk.” I don't remember how much we walk. We were pretty tired. We can only</br>   carry one bottle of water and we have already taken all, and when we cross</br>   the whole border, there was a car. It was waiting for us. We went to the</br>   car, they put a bandage in our eyes so we don't see the road.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: The coyote was always telling us to not make any noises because the</br>   border patrol was going to get us caught. I do remember everything like the</br>   experience was yesterday. So, when we got in the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it was just you, and your brother, and the coyote?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: And the coyote?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That was it?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, it was me, my brother, the coyote, and another three people.</br>   It was a partner: the kid, one kid, and another, a man. We were like five</br>   people, six, seven people. Kind of remember—it was a long time ago. My mom</br>   was not there because we went by ourselves. She was already in the US so</br>   she pay to get us into the other side. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did your father come, too?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: We didn't live with our father. He was really an alcoholic, crazy,</br>   alcoholic man. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you leave behind relatives and friends? Was it hard to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was really hard. It was complicated because my grandmother was</br>   really sick. So when we left her, she was really sick and she died one</br>   month later. So it was really sad. My friends, we left them behind. We</br>   never talk once. Once we been to the US we have never talk since, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's sad. So did your mom eventually meet you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where did she meet you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: In Chicago. She's living right now in Chicago, so we met her in</br>   Chicago as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that was a long trip on your own.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, it was a long trip. We did it. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Must've been good to see her.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was amazing, yeah. She was working and the coyote told us that</br>   she was working. Since we were the last two people with the coyote, the</br>   coyote took us to our mom. She was in a restaurant because she work as a</br>   waitress. And when we got there, she was crying. She was actually carrying</br>   dishes and the dishes just fall because she was really impressed. We</br>   haven't seen her in one year so she was really impressed and she drop all</br>   the dishes. We were all crying, you know. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. That's great. Did the US seem strange to you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was strange at first. Well, it was too big for us, you know?</br>   Iguala is really small, our city was really small. Chicago is such a huge</br>   city. The buildings are really amazing, so I remember that we were really</br>   impressed. We couldn't believe that we were in the U.S.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So we went in the Chicago in October, so it was really beautiful</br>   because the trees has those leaves color red, and some of the trees doesn't</br>   have any leaves, so it was really cool. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your brother older or younger?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He's younger. When we went to the US, I was 12 and he was 10,</br>   approximately.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, we learned in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did. How did you learn?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I learned by myself because back in the time, there was no ESL</br>   classes. So, when we went to Chicago, my mom took the time to get us into a</br>   bilingual school. And in the bilingual school, some of the classes were in</br>   Spanish and others in English, and I learn by hearing my classmates. And</br>   the teacher was always like, &quot;Hey do this,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;What?&quot; And he</br>   pointed at what I had to do, so I learned by seeing and hearing.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So no ESL?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No ESL. Until high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what grade did you start?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I started on seventh grade. Yeah, it was seven grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you didn't lose any time in school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, we didn't. Well, my brother, he was in fifth grade so he started</br>   in fifth grade and I started in seventh, so we didn't lose any timeframe.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take to feel comfortable in English?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Oh my god, I still don't feel confident because we have a lot of</br>   bully when we start to talk in English. The kids were like making fun of us</br>   because we didn't have any good English of course. They were like Americans</br>   so they were basically always bullying us because we were not American. So</br>   that was one of the, how do you say, the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The barriers?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: The barriers, yeah. The barriers, took us more time to learn</br>   English. Yeah it was actually pretty complicated. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: At first it was awkward. I didn't want to go to school because the</br>   kids were all making bully. They were all bullies. I actually got into a</br>   fight about two times because the kids were always making fun of us, that</br>   we were like Mexicans. But after that, in high school, it got better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah I did, a lot. [Chuckles]. But in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were they from all different?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I actually have a lot of friends. I have a Muslim friend</br>   actually. They were all different cultures because I went to a bilingual</br>   school as well, a bilingual high school. Most of my friends were Americans</br>   so they didn't know I was undocumented and I didn't tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know all along that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I did. But, my brother, he took a lot of more time to realize</br>   that we were not Americans because when he went to the US, he was really a</br>   kid, so he didn't realize that it was illegal. [chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your mother learn English, too?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She tried, but it was a little more complicated for her because</br>   there are no programs that support those kinds of like, to learn English</br>   undocumented. She's afraid that if she got into one of those programs, the</br>   ICE is going to get her caught, so that's why.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, she was afraid?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she was afraid.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she work a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She did work a lot in a restaurant. Right now, she's manager of a</br>   restaurant. She's the manager but she did a lot of work. She was never</br>   around the house because she has to work a lot. She was always saying that,</br>   &quot;If I came to America it's to get you in school, and to always have money</br>   so we don't end back in Mexico.&quot; That was her idea.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, then you became the mother of your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, kind of. I was always taking care of him. I teach him how to</br>   cook, or how to make the stuff. Basically, I learn from my mom, but my</br>   brother learn from me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did school compare to the schooling that you'd had in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was actually better, the education. I afraid to tell this, but</br>   the education is better in America than in Mexico. We have a lot of sports,</br>   we have the art classes, and in Mexico we didn't have any of those. We only</br>   have Spanish and math, and that's it. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you did well in school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did. I actually went into the honors roll. When I graduated from</br>   high school, I graduate as top 10 and I graduate as number three in my</br>   generation. I earned a scholarship to get into the University of Chicago,</br>   but it was only for one semester and I couldn't pay the whole career.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you got a scholarship to the University of Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. For one semester?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: For one semester?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you go?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I try, but since I have to work and I have to go to school, I</br>   couldn't manage that. It was too much for me. I couldn't. It was too much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you didn't even try, I mean you did not go—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did one semester, but the rest of that I couldn't because I didn't</br>   have any money. My family needed the money, so I try to help my mom, but</br>   ... well it was not enough. The school in America's really expensive.</br>   [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you enjoy college?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: The only one semester I went, yeah, I did. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what were you hoping to do with college?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was trying to get into the medical school. I was in liberal arts</br>   of science, but I changed my mind and I wanted to get into the medical</br>   school, but I couldn't. It was a lot of money. We didn't have any money. We</br>   did have money to get into the basics, but we didn't have enough to pay my</br>   school of course.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when you stopped college, what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I work, because-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I work as a waitress. We use fake social security numbers to get</br>   into job. I used to work at Chili's, I used to work at Discovery. I never</br>   work at McDonald's, but my brother did. Most of the time I worked as a</br>   waitress to get money to start paying my school once again, but I realize</br>   that it was too complicated. So, then I move off to Mexico. Well, it was</br>   complicated, too. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your brother also graduate from high school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He did. He did graduate from high school. He got DACA, but he didn't</br>   use the DACA. Like he only work at factories because the social security</br>   number was the legal one, however, he didn't want to study.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when you were at the University of Chicago, did you learn about</br>   DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: When I was in the University, I was approximately 17 years old, kind</br>   of. Like 17 or 18. I didn't learn about DACA until I was voluntary</br>   deported. So when I get into Mexico, one day later, they approve DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And when was that? What year?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: 2011, 2010? I don't remember quite well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, 2011 maybe.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: 2011 or something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It started in 2012.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, and I was really upset because it was one day later. Like,</br>   come on. [Chuckles]. I was waiting like my whole life to be legal. When</br>   they basically give all the people that went into the US as children the</br>   DACA, I was pretty upset. Like, what? I was in depression. Totally</br>   depression, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you were working as a waitress?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a boyfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. I used to have a boyfriend in high school and that was the only</br>   one. He was American. He study at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of</br>   Technology].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: MIT?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, so when he went to the MIT we have to broke out because</br>   actually, well you know.[Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He was really focused on his career. I want to focus on my career as</br>   well so we broke up. That was the only boyfriend that I remember. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you had voluntary departure. So, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I got caught driving without any license. Well, I was told that if I</br>   voluntary departure from the US, I wouldn't be in any trouble. So, I did</br>   what it was best for me because we went to a lawyer and that's what the</br>   lawyer suggest. So, that was six months, the timeframe that the judge gave</br>   me to leave the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you got caught driving without a license? Was there an infraction</br>   or did you just get pulled over for…?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I got pulled over. Well, they didn't tell me. They tell me that I</br>   haven't made the five second stop or something like that, but I did, but</br>   they say that I didn't. So, when the police find out that I didn't have any</br>   driver's license, he asked me about my status. I told him that it was</br>   illegal to ask about the status, but they tell me that if I was illegal</br>   they will have to call ICE on me. I was like, &quot;Come on, please don't do</br>   that.&quot; And, of course, I was begging for not to call ICE. So, they find out</br>   that I was illegal. So, basically—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They called ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They called ICE.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said a lawyer told you to listen to...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, we talked to a lawyer. Well, I was having my judge</br>   appointment, like my court, but the lawyer tell me that if I voluntary</br>   departure, I didn't have to go through all of that because if they deport</br>   me, will be worse for me. So, I went to voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how long did that take?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They took about six months, approximately.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And were you in detention or were you at home?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was in home but I have the little thingy, the, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had an ankle bracelet.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, ankle. I was like, &quot;Come on.&quot; [Chuckle]. Why?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. So, when you left, where were you going to go? Did you</br>   have a plan?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, we didn't have a plan, but we started to plan it when the</br>   circumstances got worse. So, my mom tell me that if I want to get my</br>   education, I will have to do it by myself here in Mexico. So when I got in</br>   here, it was complicated. It was complicated, but I kind of feel good.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: But it was really, Oh my god, the separation, all of that. I felt it</br>   like, “Come on. Why?” Sometimes I felt like life was really unfair. When I</br>   got in the Mexico, what I have in my mind was to study, not to let my</br>   studies go for a deportation or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: With the voluntary departure did they tell you, you could go back to</br>   the US after a certain amount of time?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, they told me that actually. But when I got in here, I wait</br>   about three, four years, then I apply for a scholarship for Rochester</br>   University and they give me the scholarship for one semester and they gave</br>   me a visa for that, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, are you going?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I already went. [Chuckles]. I was studying nuclear physics, so they</br>   give me a scholarship for math school there is on Rochester University. So,</br>   I took it. It was my opportunity to get a visa, so I took the visa and I</br>   went to Rochester for one semester, and, of course, I went to Chicago as</br>   well. [Chuckle]. I went to see my family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, are you going to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: To the US?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To finish up your—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, the scholarship was from my school. I went to the Politécnico</br>   [Instituto Politécnico Nacional]. So, it was like—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like a study abroad?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, study abroad. So, they gave me that opportunity, so I took it.</br>   I didn't think twice. I had the opportunity to go to that school or to go</br>   to Japan, so I took it to the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you have the opportunity to travel to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I have. Well, when I went to the visa interview, they actually</br>   asked me about my status and I did say the truth. They didn't tell me</br>   anything about it, so they give me the visa. So, I don't know how the laws</br>   work but they give me the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, let's go back to coming back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you transported by ICE to the border?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, I pay my own transportation because the lawyer just tell me that</br>   I have to do it. I didn't question the lawyer. I know that, well if you are</br>   a lawyer, you have to know about laws. It was provided by one of the</br>   Mexicans. It was a program in the US that... well it was only for immigrant</br>   women.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So, when my mom went to the program, and they tell her that they</br>   have this good lawyer and all of that. Well, the lawyer recommend me to go</br>   back to Mexico and do not get anything from ICE because if I do have to do</br>   it, it will be worse. So, I went here by bus. So we only took the bus and</br>   that's it. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you landed, or you came right to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well from the bus, it was from Chicago to Nuevo Laredo. The bus got</br>   into Nuevo Laredo. I have to look for the bus central to get into Mexico</br>   City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had family here?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. I didn't have anyone. Well, as I mentioned before, my</br>   grandmother has already died so we didn't have any kind of relatives that</br>   were that important. So, when I got into here, I went by myself. I have a</br>   friend in here that I met from the internet, so I asked that friend to let</br>   me stay at his home and he allow me to stay on his home. So, basically, I</br>   have to trust in someone that I didn't knew, but I had met him since I was</br>   like 13 years old when I start using the internet so I have to trust him.</br>   [Chuckles]. He helped me to look for a job at a bakery, so that was all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, the whole idea was you're going to come back and you're going</br>   to try and continue your studies? So how did that go?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: At first, it didn't go pretty well because my Spanish was horrible.</br>   Right now, my English is horrible but later, back in the time, my Spanish</br>   was horrible, so I had to learn. I save a lot of money to pay a school to</br>   get regularization—it was for learning how to write and how to speak</br>   properly. So, I took that course. I tried to do my test for getting to the</br>   UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico), but I couldn't. My Spanish</br>   was still horrible. My reading was horrible. So, I had to adapt once again</br>   to learn Spanish.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did that take?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: That took about six months probably? Or one year because I have to</br>   work, too. Here in Mexico, they do the test every six months, so I have to</br>   wait until I have learned very well. So, when I learn, once again, I did</br>   the test to get into the UNAM or to the Politécnico. I started on both</br>   school but I went to the Politécnico to study nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To study—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And are you still doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I have to finish my tests but I'm almost finished.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when did you start?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I started back in 2011, 2012? Don't remember pretty well. My mother</br>   tried to help me with money, but sometimes it was not enough for me because</br>   I have to pay my bills, and she didn't know about Mexico. She believes that</br>   it's cheaper than in the US. It is kind of cheaper—well it's not that much</br>   cheaper. I have to pay my rent, my bills, and all of that. So, basically, I</br>   started to work, and I study in the school as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you were doing part time?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, in that timeframe, I was doing part time. Right now, I work in</br>   a full job.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you're trying to finish your undergraduate degree? Is that what</br>   you're trying to finish right now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, my undergraduate degree.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: In nuclear physics and I started that second career, economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A second—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, a second career on economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so, when you graduate, you'll have a major in both?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then what? What will you do then?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, right now, what I want to do is work in the government. Well</br>   my goal in life is to do the kind of like—you know when the President is</br>   speaking, someone writes those announcements and all of that? I want to do</br>   that. I want to write for the President, so he can deliver them. I don't</br>   know how you say that in English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A speech writer.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: A speech writer, yeah for the President, or for the government,</br>   yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So, what kind of job do you have now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Right now, I work in a call center for Best Buy. I do the City Bank</br>   for credit cards actually. So, I work for the City Bank and they pay pretty</br>   well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But graduating from college, once you get your degree, will you look</br>   for a more...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I'm thinking about it because here in Mexico, the business of the</br>   science is not that good. In the US, they really try to get people to get</br>   interested in science, but in Mexico they don't even have a nuclear plant.</br>   So, where can I apply my career?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So that's why I started to study economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, will you have to get another degree in order to do what you want</br>   to do?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I will have to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, once you graduate, will you apply to school again?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Once I finish my economics, I will start a masters, if</br>   possible a PhD. In English I think it's PhD, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So right now, you've finished classwork and you need to pass tests?</br>   Is that right?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Well, my day is like, I go to work and when I finish working</br>   about 3:00— I start my day at 7:00 AM at my job, and I finish at 3:00,—and</br>   later I go to school 5:00 to 9 o'clock, and I got into my house until 11:00</br>   and I have to sleep, and then back again.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It's complicated, but you get used to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: By myself.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I really miss them. Well, when I have money ... right now, I have my</br>   visa, so ... On December, I earned a scholarship to get into economics</br>   school in Japan, so I went to Japan last year. And I got the time to go to</br>   see my family too. So, I just saw them in December.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see, I see. So, your mother's still working?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she's still working right now. She was a waitress but now</br>   she's the manager of the restaurant so she's pretty lucky. And my brother,</br>   he has DACA, but he is working in a factory for salsas. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were in the US, what were your dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I really wanted to be a doctor, but in Mexico… Oh my god, I really</br>   tried to be a doctor here, but it was complicated because most of the what</br>   is required in here to be a doctor is complicated. You need a lot of money</br>   to be a doctor. So, well, money again. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, your dreams have changed?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Right now, yeah I have a lot of different goals. More</br>   tangible, more realistic goals, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think you'll meet them?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I believe it because well I deserve it now. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My family. I really like the winter in Chicago, the snow, you know?</br>   It's really cold. I really like to be in Chicago, but the circumstances. It</br>   was complicated.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  lessons, Reflections, Cultural">Anne: So do you think that you are different having been to the US for   those years? How did it change you?     Laura: They changed me. I believe if I have stayed here in Mexico, probably   I would never learn English. Probably, I would not have the opportunity   that I have right now to travel to any other places because I like to   travel a lot.     Laura: So, when I try to compare myself with my friends, with my friends   that we left in Iguala, what I see is that they didn't have the opportunity   that I have, like to learn things, to meet some new culture, to meet   people. Like they didn't have that opportunity. They stayed in that place,   and they were absorbed by the violence, by the narco traffic, and   everything. What I think is that I was really lucky. Kind of lucky because   some things got complicated, but some things were really an experience, and   they were a nice experience.     Laura: I learn a lot from people from the US. They have a different   culture, a different, like, you know, thinking. They don't think poorly.   Always one more, and in Mexico we don't have that mentality.    </span> Anne: When you say, think one more, think...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Like, they are always out of the box—like you for your project. You</br>   are always out of the box. In Mexico, people is really closed-minded. Like,</br>   they believe that if you were born poor, you will stay poor. And I believe</br>   that's not true because what I learn in America is that if you want more,</br>   you can have it, but you have to work for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you one of the smartest kids in your classes before you left</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were always really smart?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, when I was in Mexico, it was one of the smartest one, and when</br>   I went to the US, when I learned the language, I was one of the smartest</br>   one, well, kind of.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you don't think that being one of the smartest ones in Mexico</br>   would have gotten you out?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. No, I believe that probably I will be absorbed by violence, too.</br>   Probably I would dead or something like that. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when we talk to young women about your age who grew up primarily</br>   in the U.S.—though you had a mixed childhood—a lot of them end up getting</br>   pregnant at really young ages, at 14 or 15.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And I just wanted you to reflect on that, and why that might happen,</br>   and why it was different for you.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I'm not sure why. [laughs] Maybe the education. When I went to the</br>   US, I always have a good education programs. They teach you how to use</br>   condoms and all of that now. I admire my teachers a lot. They were really</br>   smart—well for me, they were actually really smart. So I always try to time</br>   to listen to what they say, and they always tell us like, &quot;Guys, please</br>   don't get pregnant because you have a lot of life. First you have to finish</br>   your career, and all of that, and then you can get pregnant.&quot; So I listen a</br>   lot the experiences and advices.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said you went to a bilingual school. Was it a public school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was a public school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was called, well it's called Benito Juarez. That was my high</br>   school, and my elementary school was Pickard Elementary School.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. And your brother also, you know, we also hear that the</br>   young men, like your brother, often end up in gangs and criminal</br>   activities.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, no he doesn't do any gangs. But, well I believe that he</br>   listens a lot to my mom. She's always like, &quot;Learn from the Americans.</br>   Look, they don't have any children.&quot; Or, &quot;Look, they are not in gangs.&quot; And</br>   we're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Because she was like, &quot;If you really want to be</br>   American, act like an American.&quot; And we try our best to not get caught by</br>   the -“migra”- so we are always like, &quot;No, be careful. No, don't do this.&quot;</br>   Well, things happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes. I don't think I have any more questions, but is there something</br>   you would like to share to the people who might listen to this interview</br>   that you might not have said thus far that tells us more about you, your</br>   experiences as a returning migrant, anything at all?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, when I returned to Mexico, it was really complicated. When I</br>   returned in Mexico they didn't have those programs. I already told to the</br>   other girl, and I tell her like, this is the first program in about seven</br>   years that I found that actually got interest in immigrants like us. If I</br>   would find a program that actually support you for being an immigrant or</br>   something like that, I will take it. But I didn't know if you were</br>   bilingual you get paid more.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I actually learned that when I was 25, 24-years-old, and that was</br>   like when I was five years later in Mexico. If they had more programs that</br>   supported immigrants, that would be great. If they give them like the</br>   support because it's really complicated. It's a cultural shock. You are in</br>   the U.S. and they have a perspective of everything and when you get into</br>   Mexico, it is complicated.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They do not accept you because you were living in the US. They were</br>   like, &quot;Oh you chose to get into the US? Go back.&quot; Some of those comments,</br>   so it's really a shock. They should put more programs that support</br>   immigrants in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What kind of programs do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Like this one, like they help you to look for a job. They provide</br>   you more information because I didn't know that you had to certify your</br>   certificates from high school and all your transcripts before you can be</br>   here. So, it was complicated because I have to send the transcript from my</br>   school to my mom, so she can get them certified in the U.S., and then go</br>   back to Mexico. Those kind of programs that inform you about those issues</br>   or re-integrate you in the culture on the population in Mexico, or</br>   something. I don't know. Those kind of programs.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up to Interview</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anne: Tell us why the university of Chicago only gave you a full</br>   scholarship for one semester.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: What I was telling you before is that, to get any scholarship or to</br>   get into university, if you don't have any social security number, you</br>   cannot get into college. So what I did high school, I didn't tell anyone</br>   about my status because I was really afraid to get deported. So basically I</br>   put a fake social security number in my... How do you say that? My forms?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Application.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My applications, yeah. I put a play social security number in my</br>   applications. That's the reason that they accept me. But when they find out</br>   that I was undocumented, well, they only provide me with a one semester</br>   scholarship. That's the reason that I only studied for one semester in</br>   university of Chicago.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Education, Living undocumented, Opportunity">Laura: Yeah, when I was in high school, I was really smart, so, well, not   that smart, but the school told me that I can skip one year if I wanted. So   they skipped me one year because I was really, well, I was having a lot of   A's in all the classes. I was exceeding in all the classes, so they skipped   me from sophomore year to senior year. So I didn't go into junior year, and   when they skipped me, I didn't know what to do. It was too soon for me. So,   that's one of the reasons that I decided to use that fake number. I didn't   tell my mom, either, because she was going to be mad at me. She was going   to have to be like, &quot;Hey, why are you doing that? You know that it's   illegal.&quot; But come on, we were illegal already.     Anne: So your school didn't help you. They must have known that you were   undocumented there at high school.     Laura: They did know that we were undocumented and I have a counselor that   she was trying her best, but they tried to help me. They actually gave me a   scholarship to purchase my books. They gave me $1,000, some scholarship,   but it was a need required scholarship [inaudible. But for some reason it   was not enough. I went to live on the campus, but it was not enough with   that scholarship.     Anne: But they didn't advise you as you were applying for colleges about   your undocumented status and how to deal with that.     Laura: No, they didn't. They tried to guide me to apply to the scholarship.   Well, I mean this school, but they don't have that much undocumented people   in high school, and when they are undocumented, they don't actually like to   study in school. Most of them don't like to go to college or they realize   that there aren't able to study in college.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, Education, Lost opportunities">Laura: I was trying to get into the medical school. I was in liberal arts   of science, but I changed my mind and I wanted to get into the medical   school, but I couldn't. It was a lot of money. We didn't have any money. We   did have money to get into the basics, but we didn't have enough to pay my   school of course.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Bullying, Friends, Growing up undocumented">Laura: At first it was awkward. I didn't want to go to school because the   kids were all making bully. They were all bullies. I actually got into a   fight about two times because the kids were always making fun of us, that   we were like Mexicans. But after that, in high school, it got better.     Anne: Did you make friends?     Laura: Yeah I did, a lot. [Chuckles]. But in high school.     Anne: Were they from all different?     Laura: Yeah, I actually have a lot of friends. I have a Muslim friend   actually. They were all different cultures because I went to a bilingual   school as well, a bilingual high school.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Education, Language, Learning English">Laura: I learned by myself because back in the time, there was no ESL   classes. So, when we went to Chicago, my mom took the time to get us into a   bilingual school. And in the bilingual school, some of the classes were in   Spanish and others in English, and I learn by hearing my classmates. And   the teacher was always like, &quot;Hey do this,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;What?&quot; And he   pointed at what I had to do, so I learned by seeing and hearing.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Arriving in the United States, Family, Family reunification">Anne: Must've been good to see her.     Laura: It was amazing, yeah. She was working and the coyote told us that   she was working. Since we were the last two people with the coyote, the   coyote took us to our mom. She was in a restaurant because she work as a   waitress. And when we got there, she was crying. She was actually carrying   dishes and the dishes just fall because she was really impressed. We   haven't seen her in one year so she was really impressed and she drop all   the dishes. We were all crying, you know. [Chuckles].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Border crossing, Coyotes, Border crossing, Fear">Laura: Yeah, I do remember it. Well, I'm afraid of mice. So, when we   crossed the border, it was actually really awkward for me because we went   into a tunnel. It was really dark, though.     Laura: So, when we went through the tunnel, I remember it was pretty dark.   We have a lot of mice on our feet and snakes. Oh my god, even if you have   the eyes open you cannot see anything because everything was dark. The   coyote was telling us not to make any noises. I was like, “I want to scream   because I'm feeling the mice on my feet. I just want to scream and say, ‘Oh   my god,’ or ‘Ah,’ something, but I couldn't.”     Laura: My brother, when we crossed the border—my mom has already been in   the US for one year, so we crossed the border by ourselves]—when we went   with the coyote, he was like, &quot;Do not make any noises. We're going to   walk.” I don't remember how much we walk. We were pretty tired. We can only   carry one bottle of water and we have already taken all, and when we cross   the whole border, there was a car. It was waiting for us. We went to the   car, they put a bandage in our eyes so we don't see the road.     Laura: The coyote was always telling us to not make any noises because the   border patrol was going to get us caught. I do remember everything like the   experience was yesterday. So, when we got in the—     Anne: So, it was just you, and your brother, and the coyote?     Laura: And the coyote?     Anne: That was it?     Laura: Yeah, it was me, my brother, the coyote, and another three people.   It was a partner: the kid, one kid, and another, a man. We were like five   people, six, seven people. Kind of remember—it was a long time ago. My mom   was not there because we went by ourselves. She was already in the US so   she pay to get us into the other side. [Chuckles].    </span> Anne: So, did your father come, too?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: We didn't live with our father. He was really an alcoholic, crazy,</br>   alcoholic man. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you leave behind relatives and friends? Was it hard to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was really hard. It was complicated because my grandmother was</br>   really sick. So when we left her, she was really sick and she died one</br>   month later. So it was really sad. My friends, we left them behind. We</br>   never talk once. Once we been to the US we have never talk since, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's sad. So did your mom eventually meet you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where did she meet you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: In Chicago. She's living right now in Chicago, so we met her in</br>   Chicago as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that was a long trip on your own.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, it was a long trip. We did it. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Must've been good to see her.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was amazing, yeah. She was working and the coyote told us that</br>   she was working. Since we were the last two people with the coyote, the</br>   coyote took us to our mom. She was in a restaurant because she work as a</br>   waitress. And when we got there, she was crying. She was actually carrying</br>   dishes and the dishes just fall because she was really impressed. We</br>   haven't seen her in one year so she was really impressed and she drop all</br>   the dishes. We were all crying, you know. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. That's great. Did the US seem strange to you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was strange at first. Well, it was too big for us, you know?</br>   Iguala is really small, our city was really small. Chicago is such a huge</br>   city. The buildings are really amazing, so I remember that we were really</br>   impressed. We couldn't believe that we were in the U.S.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So we went in the Chicago in October, so it was really beautiful</br>   because the trees has those leaves color red, and some of the trees doesn't</br>   have any leaves, so it was really cool. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your brother older or younger?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He's younger. When we went to the US, I was 12 and he was 10,</br>   approximately.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, we learned in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did. How did you learn?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I learned by myself because back in the time, there was no ESL</br>   classes. So, when we went to Chicago, my mom took the time to get us into a</br>   bilingual school. And in the bilingual school, some of the classes were in</br>   Spanish and others in English, and I learn by hearing my classmates. And</br>   the teacher was always like, &quot;Hey do this,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;What?&quot; And he</br>   pointed at what I had to do, so I learned by seeing and hearing.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So no ESL?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No ESL. Until high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what grade did you start?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I started on seventh grade. Yeah, it was seven grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you didn't lose any time in school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, we didn't. Well, my brother, he was in fifth grade so he started</br>   in fifth grade and I started in seventh, so we didn't lose any timeframe.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take to feel comfortable in English?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Oh my god, I still don't feel confident because we have a lot of</br>   bully when we start to talk in English. The kids were like making fun of us</br>   because we didn't have any good English of course. They were like Americans</br>   so they were basically always bullying us because we were not American. So</br>   that was one of the, how do you say, the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The barriers?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: The barriers, yeah. The barriers, took us more time to learn</br>   English. Yeah it was actually pretty complicated. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: At first it was awkward. I didn't want to go to school because the</br>   kids were all making bully. They were all bullies. I actually got into a</br>   fight about two times because the kids were always making fun of us, that</br>   we were like Mexicans. But after that, in high school, it got better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah I did, a lot. [Chuckles]. But in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were they from all different?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I actually have a lot of friends. I have a Muslim friend</br>   actually. They were all different cultures because I went to a bilingual</br>   school as well, a bilingual high school. Most of my friends were Americans</br>   so they didn't know I was undocumented and I didn't tell anyone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you know all along that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I did. But, my brother, he took a lot of more time to realize</br>   that we were not Americans because when he went to the US, he was really a</br>   kid, so he didn't realize that it was illegal. [chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your mother learn English, too?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She tried, but it was a little more complicated for her because</br>   there are no programs that support those kinds of like, to learn English</br>   undocumented. She's afraid that if she got into one of those programs, the</br>   ICE is going to get her caught, so that's why.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, she was afraid?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she was afraid.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she work a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the restaurant?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She did work a lot in a restaurant. Right now, she's manager of a</br>   restaurant. She's the manager but she did a lot of work. She was never</br>   around the house because she has to work a lot. She was always saying that,</br>   &quot;If I came to America it's to get you in school, and to always have money</br>   so we don't end back in Mexico.&quot; That was her idea.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, then you became the mother of your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, kind of. I was always taking care of him. I teach him how to</br>   cook, or how to make the stuff. Basically, I learn from my mom, but my</br>   brother learn from me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did school compare to the schooling that you'd had in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was actually better, the education. I afraid to tell this, but</br>   the education is better in America than in Mexico. We have a lot of sports,</br>   we have the art classes, and in Mexico we didn't have any of those. We only</br>   have Spanish and math, and that's it. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you did well in school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did. I actually went into the honors roll. When I graduated from</br>   high school, I graduate as top 10 and I graduate as number three in my</br>   generation. I earned a scholarship to get into the University of Chicago,</br>   but it was only for one semester and I couldn't pay the whole career.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you got a scholarship to the University of Chicago?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. For one semester?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: For one semester?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you go?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I try, but since I have to work and I have to go to school, I</br>   couldn't manage that. It was too much for me. I couldn't. It was too much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you didn't even try, I mean you did not go—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did one semester, but the rest of that I couldn't because I didn't</br>   have any money. My family needed the money, so I try to help my mom, but</br>   ... well it was not enough. The school in America's really expensive.</br>   [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you enjoy college?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: The only one semester I went, yeah, I did. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what were you hoping to do with college?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was trying to get into the medical school. I was in liberal arts</br>   of science, but I changed my mind and I wanted to get into the medical</br>   school, but I couldn't. It was a lot of money. We didn't have any money. We</br>   did have money to get into the basics, but we didn't have enough to pay my</br>   school of course.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when you stopped college, what did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I work, because-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I work as a waitress. We use fake social security numbers to get</br>   into job. I used to work at Chili's, I used to work at Discovery. I never</br>   work at McDonald's, but my brother did. Most of the time I worked as a</br>   waitress to get money to start paying my school once again, but I realize</br>   that it was too complicated. So, then I move off to Mexico. Well, it was</br>   complicated, too. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your brother also graduate from high school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He did. He did graduate from high school. He got DACA, but he didn't</br>   use the DACA. Like he only work at factories because the social security</br>   number was the legal one, however, he didn't want to study.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when you were at the University of Chicago, did you learn about</br>   DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: When I was in the University, I was approximately 17 years old, kind</br>   of. Like 17 or 18. I didn't learn about DACA until I was voluntary</br>   deported. So when I get into Mexico, one day later, they approve DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And when was that? What year?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: 2011, 2010? I don't remember quite well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, 2011 maybe.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: 2011 or something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It started in 2012.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, and I was really upset because it was one day later. Like,</br>   come on. [Chuckles]. I was waiting like my whole life to be legal. When</br>   they basically give all the people that went into the US as children the</br>   DACA, I was pretty upset. Like, what? I was in depression. Totally</br>   depression, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you were working as a waitress?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a boyfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. I used to have a boyfriend in high school and that was the only</br>   one. He was American. He study at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of</br>   Technology].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: MIT?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, so when he went to the MIT we have to broke out because</br>   actually, well you know.[Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: He was really focused on his career. I want to focus on my career as</br>   well so we broke up. That was the only boyfriend that I remember. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you had voluntary departure. So, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I got caught driving without any license. Well, I was told that if I</br>   voluntary departure from the US, I wouldn't be in any trouble. So, I did</br>   what it was best for me because we went to a lawyer and that's what the</br>   lawyer suggest. So, that was six months, the timeframe that the judge gave</br>   me to leave the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you got caught driving without a license? Was there an infraction</br>   or did you just get pulled over for…?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I got pulled over. Well, they didn't tell me. They tell me that I</br>   haven't made the five second stop or something like that, but I did, but</br>   they say that I didn't. So, when the police find out that I didn't have any</br>   driver's license, he asked me about my status. I told him that it was</br>   illegal to ask about the status, but they tell me that if I was illegal</br>   they will have to call ICE on me. I was like, &quot;Come on, please don't do</br>   that.&quot; And, of course, I was begging for not to call ICE. So, they find out</br>   that I was illegal. So, basically—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They called ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They called ICE.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said a lawyer told you to listen to...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, we talked to a lawyer. Well, I was having my judge</br>   appointment, like my court, but the lawyer tell me that if I voluntary</br>   departure, I didn't have to go through all of that because if they deport</br>   me, will be worse for me. So, I went to voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how long did that take?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They took about six months, approximately.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And were you in detention or were you at home?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was in home but I have the little thingy, the, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You had an ankle bracelet.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, ankle. I was like, &quot;Come on.&quot; [Chuckle]. Why?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah. So, when you left, where were you going to go? Did you</br>   have a plan?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, we didn't have a plan, but we started to plan it when the</br>   circumstances got worse. So, my mom tell me that if I want to get my</br>   education, I will have to do it by myself here in Mexico. So when I got in</br>   here, it was complicated. It was complicated, but I kind of feel good.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: But it was really, Oh my god, the separation, all of that. I felt it</br>   like, “Come on. Why?” Sometimes I felt like life was really unfair. When I</br>   got in the Mexico, what I have in my mind was to study, not to let my</br>   studies go for a deportation or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: With the voluntary departure did they tell you, you could go back to</br>   the US after a certain amount of time?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, they told me that actually. But when I got in here, I wait</br>   about three, four years, then I apply for a scholarship for Rochester</br>   University and they give me the scholarship for one semester and they gave</br>   me a visa for that, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, are you going?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I already went. [Chuckles]. I was studying nuclear physics, so they</br>   give me a scholarship for math school there is on Rochester University. So,</br>   I took it. It was my opportunity to get a visa, so I took the visa and I</br>   went to Rochester for one semester, and, of course, I went to Chicago as</br>   well. [Chuckle]. I went to see my family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, are you going to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: To the US?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To finish up your—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, the scholarship was from my school. I went to the Politécnico</br>   [Instituto Politécnico Nacional]. So, it was like—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like a study abroad?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, study abroad. So, they gave me that opportunity, so I took it.</br>   I didn't think twice. I had the opportunity to go to that school or to go</br>   to Japan, so I took it to the US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you have the opportunity to travel to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I have. Well, when I went to the visa interview, they actually</br>   asked me about my status and I did say the truth. They didn't tell me</br>   anything about it, so they give me the visa. So, I don't know how the laws</br>   work but they give me the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, let's go back to coming back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you transported by ICE to the border?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, I pay my own transportation because the lawyer just tell me that</br>   I have to do it. I didn't question the lawyer. I know that, well if you are</br>   a lawyer, you have to know about laws. It was provided by one of the</br>   Mexicans. It was a program in the US that... well it was only for immigrant</br>   women.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So, when my mom went to the program, and they tell her that they</br>   have this good lawyer and all of that. Well, the lawyer recommend me to go</br>   back to Mexico and do not get anything from ICE because if I do have to do</br>   it, it will be worse. So, I went here by bus. So we only took the bus and</br>   that's it. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you landed, or you came right to Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well from the bus, it was from Chicago to Nuevo Laredo. The bus got</br>   into Nuevo Laredo. I have to look for the bus central to get into Mexico</br>   City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had family here?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. I didn't have anyone. Well, as I mentioned before, my</br>   grandmother has already died so we didn't have any kind of relatives that</br>   were that important. So, when I got into here, I went by myself. I have a</br>   friend in here that I met from the internet, so I asked that friend to let</br>   me stay at his home and he allow me to stay on his home. So, basically, I</br>   have to trust in someone that I didn't knew, but I had met him since I was</br>   like 13 years old when I start using the internet so I have to trust him.</br>   [Chuckles]. He helped me to look for a job at a bakery, so that was all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, the whole idea was you're going to come back and you're going</br>   to try and continue your studies? So how did that go?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: At first, it didn't go pretty well because my Spanish was horrible.</br>   Right now, my English is horrible but later, back in the time, my Spanish</br>   was horrible, so I had to learn. I save a lot of money to pay a school to</br>   get regularization—it was for learning how to write and how to speak</br>   properly. So, I took that course. I tried to do my test for getting to the</br>   UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico), but I couldn't. My Spanish</br>   was still horrible. My reading was horrible. So, I had to adapt once again</br>   to learn Spanish.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did that take?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: That took about six months probably? Or one year because I have to</br>   work, too. Here in Mexico, they do the test every six months, so I have to</br>   wait until I have learned very well. So, when I learn, once again, I did</br>   the test to get into the UNAM or to the Politécnico. I started on both</br>   school but I went to the Politécnico to study nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To study—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And are you still doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I have to finish my tests but I'm almost finished.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when did you start?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I started back in 2011, 2012? Don't remember pretty well. My mother</br>   tried to help me with money, but sometimes it was not enough for me because</br>   I have to pay my bills, and she didn't know about Mexico. She believes that</br>   it's cheaper than in the US. It is kind of cheaper—well it's not that much</br>   cheaper. I have to pay my rent, my bills, and all of that. So, basically, I</br>   started to work, and I study in the school as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you were doing part time?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, in that timeframe, I was doing part time. Right now, I work in</br>   a full job.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you're trying to finish your undergraduate degree? Is that what</br>   you're trying to finish right now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, my undergraduate degree.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In nuclear physics.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: In nuclear physics and I started that second career, economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A second—</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, a second career on economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so, when you graduate, you'll have a major in both?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then what? What will you do then?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, right now, what I want to do is work in the government. Well</br>   my goal in life is to do the kind of like—you know when the President is</br>   speaking, someone writes those announcements and all of that? I want to do</br>   that. I want to write for the President, so he can deliver them. I don't</br>   know how you say that in English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A speech writer.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: A speech writer, yeah for the President, or for the government,</br>   yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So, what kind of job do you have now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Right now, I work in a call center for Best Buy. I do the City Bank</br>   for credit cards actually. So, I work for the City Bank and they pay pretty</br>   well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But graduating from college, once you get your degree, will you look</br>   for a more...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I'm thinking about it because here in Mexico, the business of the</br>   science is not that good. In the US, they really try to get people to get</br>   interested in science, but in Mexico they don't even have a nuclear plant.</br>   So, where can I apply my career?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So that's why I started to study economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, will you have to get another degree in order to do what you want</br>   to do?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I will have to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, once you graduate, will you apply to school again?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Once I finish my economics, I will start a masters, if</br>   possible a PhD. In English I think it's PhD, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So right now, you've finished classwork and you need to pass tests?</br>   Is that right?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Well, my day is like, I go to work and when I finish working</br>   about 3:00— I start my day at 7:00 AM at my job, and I finish at 3:00,—and</br>   later I go to school 5:00 to 9 o'clock, and I got into my house until 11:00</br>   and I have to sleep, and then back again.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It's complicated, but you get used to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: By myself.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I really miss them. Well, when I have money ... right now, I have my</br>   visa, so ... On December, I earned a scholarship to get into economics</br>   school in Japan, so I went to Japan last year. And I got the time to go to</br>   see my family too. So, I just saw them in December.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see, I see. So, your mother's still working?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, she's still working right now. She was a waitress but now</br>   she's the manager of the restaurant so she's pretty lucky. And my brother,</br>   he has DACA, but he is working in a factory for salsas. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were in the US, what were your dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I really wanted to be a doctor, but in Mexico… Oh my god, I really</br>   tried to be a doctor here, but it was complicated because most of the what</br>   is required in here to be a doctor is complicated. You need a lot of money</br>   to be a doctor. So, well, money again. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, your dreams have changed?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Right now, yeah I have a lot of different goals. More</br>   tangible, more realistic goals, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think you'll meet them?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, I believe it because well I deserve it now. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My family. I really like the winter in Chicago, the snow, you know?</br>   It's really cold. I really like to be in Chicago, but the circumstances. It</br>   was complicated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So do you think that you are different having been to the US for</br>   those years? How did it change you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They changed me. I believe if I have stayed here in Mexico, probably</br>   I would never learn English. Probably, I would not have the opportunity</br>   that I have right now to travel to any other places because I like to</br>   travel a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: So, when I try to compare myself with my friends, with my friends</br>   that we left in Iguala, what I see is that they didn't have the opportunity</br>   that I have, like to learn things, to meet some new culture, to meet</br>   people. Like they didn't have that opportunity. They stayed in that place,</br>   and they were absorbed by the violence, by the narco traffic, and</br>   everything. What I think is that I was really lucky. Kind of lucky because</br>   some things got complicated, but some things were really an experience, and</br>   they were a nice experience.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I learn a lot from people from the US. They have a different</br>   culture, a different, like, you know, thinking. They don't think poorly.</br>   Always one more, and in Mexico we don't have that mentality.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you say, think one more, think...?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Like, they are always out of the box—like you for your project. You</br>   are always out of the box. In Mexico, people is really closed-minded. Like,</br>   they believe that if you were born poor, you will stay poor. And I believe</br>   that's not true because what I learn in America is that if you want more,</br>   you can have it, but you have to work for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you one of the smartest kids in your classes before you left</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were always really smart?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, when I was in Mexico, it was one of the smartest one, and when</br>   I went to the US, when I learned the language, I was one of the smartest</br>   one, well, kind of.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you don't think that being one of the smartest ones in Mexico</br>   would have gotten you out?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No. No, I believe that probably I will be absorbed by violence, too.</br>   Probably I would dead or something like that. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when we talk to young women about your age who grew up primarily</br>   in the U.S.—though you had a mixed childhood—a lot of them end up getting</br>   pregnant at really young ages, at 14 or 15.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And I just wanted you to reflect on that, and why that might happen,</br>   and why it was different for you.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I'm not sure why. [laughs] Maybe the education. When I went to the</br>   US, I always have a good education programs. They teach you how to use</br>   condoms and all of that now. I admire my teachers a lot. They were really</br>   smart—well for me, they were actually really smart. So I always try to time</br>   to listen to what they say, and they always tell us like, &quot;Guys, please</br>   don't get pregnant because you have a lot of life. First you have to finish</br>   your career, and all of that, and then you can get pregnant.&quot; So I listen a</br>   lot the experiences and advices.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said you went to a bilingual school. Was it a public school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was a public school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was called, well it's called Benito Juarez. That was my high</br>   school, and my elementary school was Pickard Elementary School.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. And your brother also, you know, we also hear that the</br>   young men, like your brother, often end up in gangs and criminal</br>   activities.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, no he doesn't do any gangs. But, well I believe that he</br>   listens a lot to my mom. She's always like, &quot;Learn from the Americans.</br>   Look, they don't have any children.&quot; Or, &quot;Look, they are not in gangs.&quot; And</br>   we're like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Because she was like, &quot;If you really want to be</br>   American, act like an American.&quot; And we try our best to not get caught by</br>   the -“migra”- so we are always like, &quot;No, be careful. No, don't do this.&quot;</br>   Well, things happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes. I don't think I have any more questions, but is there something</br>   you would like to share to the people who might listen to this interview</br>   that you might not have said thus far that tells us more about you, your</br>   experiences as a returning migrant, anything at all?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, when I returned to Mexico, it was really complicated. When I</br>   returned in Mexico they didn't have those programs. I already told to the</br>   other girl, and I tell her like, this is the first program in about seven</br>   years that I found that actually got interest in immigrants like us. If I</br>   would find a program that actually support you for being an immigrant or</br>   something like that, I will take it. But I didn't know if you were</br>   bilingual you get paid more.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I actually learned that when I was 25, 24-years-old, and that was</br>   like when I was five years later in Mexico. If they had more programs that</br>   supported immigrants, that would be great. If they give them like the</br>   support because it's really complicated. It's a cultural shock. You are in</br>   the U.S. and they have a perspective of everything and when you get into</br>   Mexico, it is complicated.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They do not accept you because you were living in the US. They were</br>   like, &quot;Oh you chose to get into the US? Go back.&quot; Some of those comments,</br>   so it's really a shock. They should put more programs that support</br>   immigrants in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What kind of programs do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Like this one, like they help you to look for a job. They provide</br>   you more information because I didn't know that you had to certify your</br>   certificates from high school and all your transcripts before you can be</br>   here. So, it was complicated because I have to send the transcript from my</br>   school to my mom, so she can get them certified in the U.S., and then go</br>   back to Mexico. Those kind of programs that inform you about those issues</br>   or re-integrate you in the culture on the population in Mexico, or</br>   something. I don't know. Those kind of programs.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Follow up to Interview</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anne: Tell us why the university of Chicago only gave you a full</br>   scholarship for one semester.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: What I was telling you before is that, to get any scholarship or to</br>   get into university, if you don't have any social security number, you</br>   cannot get into college. So what I did high school, I didn't tell anyone</br>   about my status because I was really afraid to get deported. So basically I</br>   put a fake social security number in my... How do you say that? My forms?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Application.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My applications, yeah. I put a play social security number in my</br>   applications. That's the reason that they accept me. But when they find out</br>   that I was undocumented, well, they only provide me with a one semester</br>   scholarship. That's the reason that I only studied for one semester in</br>   university of Chicago.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, when I was in high school, I was really smart, so, well, not</br>   that smart, but the school told me that I can skip one year if I wanted. So</br>   they skipped me one year because I was really, well, I was having a lot of</br>   A's in all the classes. I was exceeding in all the classes, so they skipped</br>   me from sophomore year to senior year. So I didn't go into junior year, and</br>   when they skipped me, I didn't know what to do. It was too soon for me. So,</br>   that's one of the reasons that I decided to use that fake number. I didn't</br>   tell my mom, either, because she was going to be mad at me. She was going</br>   to have to be like, &quot;Hey, why are you doing that? You know that it's</br>   illegal.&quot; But come on, we were illegal already.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So your school didn't help you. They must have known that you were</br>   undocumented there at high school.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They did know that we were undocumented and I have a counselor that</br>   she was trying her best, but they tried to help me. They actually gave me a</br>   scholarship to purchase my books. They gave me $1,000, some scholarship,</br>   but it was a need required scholarship [inaudible. But for some reason it</br>   was not enough. I went to live on the campus, but it was not enough with</br>   that scholarship.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But they didn't advise you as you were applying for colleges about</br>   your undocumented status and how to deal with that.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, they didn't. They tried to guide me to apply to the scholarship.</br>   Well, I mean this school, but they don't have that much undocumented people</br>   in high school, and when they are undocumented, they don't actually like to</br>   study in school. Most of them don't like to go to college or they realize</br>   that there aren't able to study in college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were sort of an anomaly. They didn't know what to do with you.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah, they didn't know what to do with me.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
