So this is <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span> with <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>, doing the interview now. So</br>   we're just going to talk a little bit more in depth about some of the</br>   things you mentioned in the survey that I want to go back to.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: The one thing that I remember you said that stood out to me was your</br>   reasons for coming back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. So can you tell me a little bit more</br>   about that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Why you weren't feeling like the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> was the right place for you at</br>   the moment?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Well, I guess I was in school and I started doing substance abuse</br>   and I guess I got depressed. It's like I wasn't really trying at school. My</br>   friends were working all the time. I guess nobody like, could supervise me.</br>   Yeah, I had bad influences. I hung out with the wrong crowd and I guess I</br>   had no purpose for going to school. I said, &quot;Why am I even going to</br>   school?&quot; I didn't even know. I didn't even like see a reason, a good reason</br>   to go. So it's like it didn't matter to me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: So I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">9th</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">10th</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">11th</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">12th</span> grade, not really learning. I</br>   just got past, you know? And at the end, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">12th</span> grade, the vice principal</br>   called me, he's like, &quot;Hey, you're not going to graduate here, you should</br>   go to this school.&quot; And they sent me to that school and that school was</br>   like, it was full of people like me that didn't really care and -</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay. Like an alternative school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative). Uh-huh (affirmative). You'd get less</br>   credits, you had to earn less credits to graduate. And there I guess, it's</br>   more about crowds, so it's like I had even less reason to really graduate</br>   and I ended up just dropping out like when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>. And from there I guess</br>   I got addicted to video games, like really addicted to video games. I</br>   guess... I don't know, to escape, I feel like I had my reason, I guess that</br>   was my reason to get good at that game, because that was my reason for</br>   living, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: And the other... We moved away from town, where I would hang out</br>   with all my friends and yeah, so I just isolated myself with some games. I</br>   spent like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five, like three, seven, four, five, six, seven years</span> just doing</br>   that. I got really bad, I guess my social skills got really bad, just lost</br>   all my friends. Got new friends online that weren't really friends. I</br>   didn't even know who they were. And yeah, I was just in a really bad state</br>   of mind, you know? I hated going outside, it was so... I guess I didn't</br>   know where to get help. I guess I had a computer, so I'd be on the computer</br>   and I'd just research a bunch of stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I guess I'll talk about how I was trying to... I thought I had</br>   really bad anxiety, and I was finding a way to cure it. And I researched,</br>   it's all like, &quot;Oh, you got to expose yourself and do this.&quot; And then</br>   there's these mushrooms, I guess, that will help you, like psychedelic</br>   therapy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: And I read it online that you shouldn't do it on your own. You</br>   know? I was really like, that was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, was... to do it on my own. You</br>   might just kill yourself, you know? So I did that, I went on research and I</br>   waited for the perfect time like when the rain comes. I went looking and</br>   stuff, I knew it was really dangerous, I was scared. At one point I found,</br>   outside, a mushroom that I thought was it, but I was just so scared to do</br>   it, you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Did you buy them from someone or you found them outside?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: No, I found them. I read research on them and I found them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: You had to look at the texture, the color, and the feel of it, the</br>   size, everything. And I found it and it's like, well I feel like this is</br>   it, but there's many look-alikes and I don't want to die. I found this</br>   other mushroom, it was really colorful and this one was super easy to</br>   identify, and I read up on it and it said it had properties that would get</br>   rid of anxiety.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: So, I found this mushroom and I prepared it, cut it up, put it in</br>   the oven, dried it, made tea out of it and I had it. And the crazy thing is</br>   when I had it, I guess it was toxic. I read a lot about it, it is toxic, a</br>   lot of people were like, &quot;But it's not toxic enough to harm you.&quot; And</br>   people report a feeling of less anxiety after they take it. And I did feel</br>   that, it did help.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So it did help a bit?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative). Yes. I felt less anxiety. So I was dumb. I</br>   was like, &quot;Okay. I guess if that took away this much anxiety, like if the</br>   more I do it the more it's going to have an effect. So I did that, the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time my mom found out about it and she didn't like it. I told her</br>   about it and I guess I have to hide it now, because she came home saying</br>   was like, &quot;Oh no, what are you doing? Oh stop.&quot; Got really mad at me. This</br>   one day I did it, I was like, &quot;I did it&quot;, and she came home from work and I</br>   had already done it, and I told her, you know? Just in case, because I was</br>   like &quot;Dang, what if I took too much?&quot;, because I did take a lot. And I took</br>   a lot, the dose was probably like more potent than the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> one, it was.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: So she came home and I was playing with the ball and all of a</br>   sudden I felt like the world was spinning, not like the other time, the</br>   first time it just made me sleepy. I drooled a bit and went to sleep. I</br>   woke up <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the next day</span> and I felt those effects that I was talking about, but</br>   this time I felt the world spinning, I felt little like... Like here it was</br>   swirling and here was swirling. It was kind of hard to describe, I felt it</br>   swirling, it's really weird. And I don't remember anything after that. Like</br>   anything after that, it was her telling me what happened, that I went to</br>   the room and fell asleep and she got worried because I wasn't waking up. So</br>   she went, slapped me, threw water on me, just did everything to wake me up.</br>   She called a friend, scared, he came over and he suggested calling 911.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: So 911 came and they checked me, my pulse was getting slower. I</br>   guess they injected something to wake me up, it wasn't working. I guess</br>   they decided to take me to a hospital. They took me to the hospital and I</br>   guess they didn't have the tools to help with that, to help with the</br>   overdose, so they transported me to another place. And there, they had to</br>   put a tube down my throat and remove the liquid, and they put me to sleep.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I remember having dreams, I felt like it was a dream and I was</br>   fighting to get out of this bed, like trying to fight out of this hospital</br>   bed really hard. And just little moments where I had consciousness and I</br>   remember little parts, and yeah, I just remember fighting really hard just</br>   to get out. I felt really strong and unstoppable. And I guess one of the</br>   reasons is, I guess, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Vikings</span> before going to battle would take this</br>   mushroom and they'd feel enraged and empowered. So I guess I was too then,</br>   right? And yeah, so yeah, that happened.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: If you don't mind me asking, you didn't have papers at this time,</br>   right? Did you have health insurance, some kind of health care?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: No. No, no, no.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So how did that work with having these hospital visits? Did you have</br>   really expensive bills? Did they cover it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I mean, it was only that one day, and actually the church paid for</br>   it because I would go to this church. And yeah, I guess a little silly</br>   thing happened, my pastor came... My mom called the pastor because I wasn't</br>   listening to the doctor. I guess I was unconscious or something, and the</br>   doctor was giving me instructions because they wanted to remove the tube,</br>   and I had to sit up or something. I was sedated and they would remove the</br>   sedative and I'd wake up and they would ask me to do things, I wouldn't</br>   listen. So they called the pastor and I actually listened to him. The</br>   doctor would ask me to do something, I'd be like, &quot;No, I'm laughing here.&quot;</br>   I'd be like, &quot;No.&quot; And the pastor came and I was like, &quot;All right, I did</br>   it.&quot; So they found out about it and they were nice enough to pay for that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Okay. That's great.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. So I was really grateful.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: How did your legal status impact your anxiety? Do you feel like it</br>   gave you more anxiety?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. It's like when I became aware of it, I told my friend and my</br>   friend was like, &quot;You should get a -- your green card, you know?&quot; And I</br>   guess ever since then I felt like... just judged, you know, like I felt</br>   afraid that somebody would find out. I was scared, you know? There was</br>   other people like me that... they wouldn't care, they'd share it, and I'd</br>   be like, &quot;Why? You know... Why?&quot; So it was really embarrassing for me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Did you tell your friends or people at school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: No, I’ve only one friend. I guess the feedback that he gave me,</br>   it's like I guess I didn't want to tell anybody. I felt really like...</br>   Yeah, I guess just ashamed for it. And then just scared, the police,</br>   they're going to ask me if I'm legal or not. And it became even more scary</br>   when I was in high school, middle school, and I was with the bad crowd and</br>   we bought some cans and spray painted this church. And the church was</br>   really nice. They didn't put charges and when we were cleaning they took us</br>   to eat. They were just really nice, you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: And so, when that happened, the police, they talked with me and my</br>   mom, they were like, &quot;Hey, we know you're illegal. You know? We're not</br>   going to report you to immigration. We just want a clean community, we just</br>   don't want any problems.&quot; But still, it's like now they know. It's like,</br>   they know. Next time I do something, it's going to be, I guess, I'm just</br>   going to get kicked out or something. So it just created a fear.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So that made you really nervous.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Anytime I had an encounter with the police, it just like... Oh, I</br>   have to say like red and white or something. I'd just really just feel very</br>   panicked inside. And it didn't help that sometimes I guess they'd tell my</br>   mom you know like, &quot;Hey, immigration's around, don't open the door, if</br>   somebody knocks check who it is.&quot; It's like dang, you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's a scary fear to grow up with.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. Yeah, it's like...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: When did you find out that you were undocumented? Or did you always</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Nope, in high school. Around high school, like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">9th</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">10th</span> grade. I</br>   guess that's what sent me down to depression because it was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">9th</span> grade,</br>   you transition from middle school to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">9th</span>, it's a big change and then you</br>   find out this. And obviously, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So finding out about being undocumented kind of made everything</br>   worse?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. It just added onto it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And then you mention in the survey about, when we were talking about</br>   whether you feel safe in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, and you said that at least you don't have</br>   the fear of the authorities that you have in the States.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. When I came I was so relieved. I'm like, &quot;Awesome. I'm</br>   legal. I feel legal.&quot; That was nice, and then it's like, &quot;Now what?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: But in that way, do you feel less afraid?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah, I felt relieved, I felt free. And that was nice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Had you ever felt free like that before in your life?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Ever since I found out [I was undocumented], no, because I felt</br>   like I'm always doing something wrong. I could just be here and [in US] I</br>   feel like, I don't know, like I'm doing something wrong. And I didn't even</br>   want to work, with pap-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: In order to work, you got to forage for papers and I didn't want</br>   to do all that at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. I didn't want to do that, but it's like I guess I</br>   have to.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah. What choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. Yeah, what choice, you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And then what was your adjustment like coming back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>? What</br>   was, let's say <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, what was the hardest part about adjusting to life</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I guess just knowing what to do. I guess just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> accepting the</br>   fact that I was just going to work in the field and I had nowhere else to</br>   go. Just like life was harder there... Just learning how to interact with</br>   people here, because they have a different way of communicating. It's like,</br>   you've got to communicate the way they do, otherwise you're like, I don't</br>   know, like, outcast.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Communicate in what way?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Like here people talk to each other with like jokes and stuff all</br>   the time, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, all the time. And sometimes you're left out because you</br>   don't understand what... It's like puns or something like that. They say</br>   something, but it means something else, and there's a lot of that. It's</br>   like you say one thing and then it's not... it doesn't mean that, it means</br>   something else. And so, you've got to like kind of learn to decipher that.</br>   It was really hard at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, I would always be out of the loop like, &quot;Wh-</br>   What?&quot;, because that was hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And then speaking <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> when you got here, was that tough?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah, at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, yeah because I wasn't used to it. Sometimes I</br>   would say words in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, they'd just come out of me, and it's like, &quot;Oh</br>   dude, I didn't realize.&quot; You know? And they'd just be like, &quot;What?&quot; And</br>   just, yeah, I guess learning all these new words, you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative). What's been the best part about being back in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Well... I guess learning to speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> better. Just feeling</br>   more free, like I can go wherever I want. Police aren't going to be looking</br>   at me, I don't have to worry about them. Whoa... Now with police are</br>   assholes sometimes, I guess everywhere they're that way. They're like that</br>   everywhere, right? But just that fear of like, &quot;I don't know what's going</br>   to happen. They're just going to send me away&quot;, and stuff like, &quot;I don't</br>   know what's going to happen.&quot; I guess that's gone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: But you're separated from your family. Was that your parents, and</br>   sister?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. I mean, I guess I chose to do that to myself. I just didn't</br>   know it was going to be that hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So being away from your family is harder than you thought it would</br>   be?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah, at first like, &quot;I'm free.&quot; By <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> I was like, &quot;I'm good.&quot;</br>   And then it's like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span>, it's like, &quot;Okay, well, when am I going to</br>   see them?&quot; I'm like, &quot;This is...&quot; Yeah, I guess you start feeling it. It</br>   took me awhile. I was like, &quot;Dang, am I ever going to see them?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And you said you have an uncle that was deported?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah, but I wasn't really that close to him. I just know he's my</br>   uncle.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So you don't have any close family members here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: No, not really. Here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>? Like here, here? No, I'm here</br>   alone. Like most of my family's in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nayarit</span>. My grandma, my aunts and</br>   cousins.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you ever go to visit them there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Since I came here? No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: That's pretty far from here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah, it's like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">three, four, like 12 hours</span>. Around there. Depends</br>   if you're going on an airplane or... Depends by what.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Is there anything that you feel like the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government should</br>   be doing or that they could be doing differently to support return migrants</br>   like you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Well yeah, I guess... A lot of people here have trouble with their</br>   papers, like school papers. They probably graduated or they have college</br>   and they come here and it's like they have nothing. Maybe something to</br>   accommodate that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yes, I've heard that from a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. That's definitely the number <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Did you have trouble with that, your papers from high school in the</br>   U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I mean, I came and yeah they had to ask me for like get my</br>   transcript. I mean the school did give me my transcripts. Other people here</br>   have trouble with that, they won't get their transcript unless they were</br>   there in person. I mean, I guess I was lucky that I got those. I guess I</br>   didn't really struggle too much with that, but I see how other people do.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So making the education system easier to try to transfer-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: To validate their studies, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: So they can integrate to the schooling system here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's huge. What about in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>?</br>   What do you think the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> government could be doing differently in how</br>   they treat or how they support migrants, migrant families like yours?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I really don't really know how to answer that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: It's kind of a broad question. So maybe, is there anything that you</br>   wish average people in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> understood about migrants? Migrants from</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>? Is there anything that you wish people understood better about you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I mean, I guess why they go there. It's not like they just go,</br>   just because they want to take away from them. You know? They do it for a</br>   reason. It's like if <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> was as big as them, they would probably do the</br>   same, possibly. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: So like, yeah, I guess. Yeah... Give them different people's</br>   viewpoints on why they go there. Yeah, don't just assume they just come</br>   over to take over.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah, yeah. Understand that people have a reason for doing it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And do you consider yourself more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Well, I have no clue. I guess I feel more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> because I know</br>   that I was born here. I knew that I was not born over there. So it's like,</br>   I guess I feel more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, but at the same time I feel sort of</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>-ish and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican American</span>-ish. I don't know. I don't know, I don't</br>   know, I guess it's both.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Hard to know how to...? Like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">50/50</span> or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">50/50</span>. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Which <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">50%</span> would be... Like, what's the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> part of you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I guess just the culture, I guess. Yeah, I had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> parents,</br>   but it's like I interacted more with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>, so it's like... I guess,</br>   the music. Yeah, the music, I guess. Yeah, not too sure. The lifestyle, I'm</br>   used to having more money, and the style too like... here I guess. Well,</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, it's more varied, but where I'm from, el rancho , they</br>   dress a certain way. They have their own style. I don't really follow that.</br>   You know, like they dress in their hats and stuff like that and like I</br>   don't really do that. Like the music too, I don't really feel like I really</br>   like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> music. It's like I'm forcing myself to do it because I want to</br>   fit in, but in the end I don't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you feel like you stand out there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah, definitely. Like the type of music I listen to, sometimes my</br>   ideas are very different.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Like what kind of ideas?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I guess like my religion, I guess I was born into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Christianity</span>,</br>   and here it's like Catholicism, so it's like, my family is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Catholic</span>. It's</br>   like, &quot;Oy.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: So not, yeah, not quite the same here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative). It's like, I guess-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do people treat you differently because of that here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I mean I had some friends who were like, &quot;Sometimes I've been</br>   discriminated.&quot; Like, &quot;Oh you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>&quot; tu vienes de alla because they</br>   know that I come from over there. Like, &quot;Nah, you're from over there,</br>   you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, you can't be a part of this&quot;, or something like that. So</br>   yeah, then I'm , &quot;Nah, I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> too. I was born here. Yeah, I lived over</br>   there, but I was born here.&quot; So it's like, yeah they don't see me as too</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. I see myself as <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. It's because of that I said not too much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: I've heard a lot of people say things where it's like you don't feel</br>   like you belong here, but you don't belong there either.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. There's a saying. Ni de aqui ni de alla. [neither from her</br>   nor there]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Do you feel like that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah. I mean now I feel like more part of here now that I have</br>   spent more time here, so I'm getting used to it here. I guess I'm seeing</br>   myself more as a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> citizen now. I'd still like to go there though, I</br>   still want to... I don't know. I guess I was a citizen, I wish I was a</br>   citizen of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and the United States. That'd be fucking awesome. I live</br>   here and then over there, it's like... Yeah, that'd be sweet.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: The best of both worlds.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: The best of both worlds.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: And then you could see your family more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Yeah, definitely. That'd be pretty cool.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Well as we start wrapping up, because I know we got to get you back</br>   to class too. Is there any last thing that you feel like you haven't had</br>   the chance to share or that you want people to understand about you or</br>   people in your situation?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Let's see... Well, I really feel like this was all my fault. I</br>   hung out with the wrong crowd. I mean part of it was my status, but mostly</br>   it was my life decisions, you know? I hung out with the wrong crowd. I</br>   guess I didn't really have guidance. I ended up in a position where I</br>   didn't like being there. I guess I found the solution was to leave.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I mean that was my reason for coming over here. I felt so trapped</br>   in the game. I was like, &quot;If I just go over there, I'm going to be forced</br>   to not play video games. I'm going to be forced to reintegrate into society</br>   and just change, you know? Like, just coming back here is going to change</br>   me.&quot; And it did, I guess it worked, I saved myself, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I mean I was kind of dumb because I could've seeked help. I</br>   could've like... I guess I didn't know where, I didn't know where.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: Yeah. And I know I said we were done, but just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> last question. So</br>   you're just finishing school now. What do you hope for, for your future?</br>   What are your thoughts for your future here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: Well, yeah. Yeah, definitely becoming a good software developer.</br>   Just establishing myself as good. I mean, I don't want to be the best. I</br>   want to be up there. I don't want to be the best. Like I want to set goals</br>   for myself, I want to accomplish them. And yeah, maybe if getting a visa</br>   doesn't work out, like my parents get deported, I'll be there to support my</br>   mom.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span>: I guess them bringing me over there did teach me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. It did</br>   give me like... It put me in a better place than most people here. So I'd</br>   say, I guess I want to give back to them. I guess that's part of the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> culture too, is to give back. So I guess I want to do that, also</br>   for myself, you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzy</span>: To be able to support yourself, but also your family if they need</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yordani</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Drugs, Taking, Addiction">Yordani: Well, I guess I was in school and I started doing substance abuse   and I guess I got depressed. It's like I wasn't really trying at school. My   friends were working all the time. I guess nobody like, could supervise me.   Yeah, I had bad influences. I hung out with the wrong crowd and I guess I   had no purpose for going to school. I said, &quot;Why am I even going to   school?&quot; I didn't even know. I didn't even like see a reason, a good reason   to go. So it's like it didn't matter to me.    </span> Yordani: So I went to 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade, not really learning. I</br>   just got past, you know? And at the end, in 12th grade, the vice principal</br>   called me, he's like, &quot;Hey, you're not going to graduate here, you should</br>   go to this school.&quot; And they sent me to that school and that school was</br>   like, it was full of people like me that didn't really care and -</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Okay. Like an alternative school?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). Uh-huh (affirmative). You'd get less</br>   credits, you had to earn less credits to graduate. And there I guess, it's</br>   more about crowds, so it's like I had even less reason to really graduate</br>   and I ended up just dropping out like when I was 18. And from there I guess</br>   I got addicted to video games, like really addicted to video games. I</br>   guess... I don't know, to escape, I feel like I had my reason, I guess that</br>   was my reason to get good at that game, because that was my reason for</br>   living, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: And the other... We moved away from town, where I would hang out</br>   with all my friends and yeah, so I just isolated myself with some games. I</br>   spent like five, like three, seven, four, five, six, seven years just doing</br>   that. I got really bad, I guess my social skills got really bad, just lost</br>   all my friends. Got new friends online that weren't really friends. I</br>   didn't even know who they were. And yeah, I was just in a really bad state</br>   of mind, you know? I hated going outside, it was so... I guess I didn't</br>   know where to get help. I guess I had a computer, so I'd be on the computer</br>   and I'd just research a bunch of stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess I'll talk about how I was trying to... I thought I had</br>   really bad anxiety, and I was finding a way to cure it. And I researched,</br>   it's all like, &quot;Oh, you got to expose yourself and do this.&quot; And then</br>   there's these mushrooms, I guess, that will help you, like psychedelic</br>   therapy.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: And I read it online that you shouldn't do it on your own. You</br>   know? I was really like, that was the first, was... to do it on my own. You</br>   might just kill yourself, you know? So I did that, I went on research and I</br>   waited for the perfect time like when the rain comes. I went looking and</br>   stuff, I knew it was really dangerous, I was scared. At one point I found,</br>   outside, a mushroom that I thought was it, but I was just so scared to do</br>   it, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you buy them from someone or you found them outside?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, I found them. I read research on them and I found them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: You had to look at the texture, the color, and the feel of it, the</br>   size, everything. And I found it and it's like, well I feel like this is</br>   it, but there's many look-alikes and I don't want to die. I found this</br>   other mushroom, it was really colorful and this one was super easy to</br>   identify, and I read up on it and it said it had properties that would get</br>   rid of anxiety.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So, I found this mushroom and I prepared it, cut it up, put it in</br>   the oven, dried it, made tea out of it and I had it. And the crazy thing is</br>   when I had it, I guess it was toxic. I read a lot about it, it is toxic, a</br>   lot of people were like, &quot;But it's not toxic enough to harm you.&quot; And</br>   people report a feeling of less anxiety after they take it. And I did feel</br>   that, it did help.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So it did help a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). Yes. I felt less anxiety. So I was dumb. I</br>   was like, &quot;Okay. I guess if that took away this much anxiety, like if the</br>   more I do it the more it's going to have an effect. So I did that, the</br>   first time my mom found out about it and she didn't like it. I told her</br>   about it and I guess I have to hide it now, because she came home saying</br>   was like, &quot;Oh no, what are you doing? Oh stop.&quot; Got really mad at me. This</br>   one day I did it, I was like, &quot;I did it&quot;, and she came home from work and I</br>   had already done it, and I told her, you know? Just in case, because I was</br>   like &quot;Dang, what if I took too much?&quot;, because I did take a lot. And I took</br>   a lot, the dose was probably like more potent than the first one, it was.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So she came home and I was playing with the ball and all of a</br>   sudden I felt like the world was spinning, not like the other time, the</br>   first time it just made me sleepy. I drooled a bit and went to sleep. I</br>   woke up the next day and I felt those effects that I was talking about, but</br>   this time I felt the world spinning, I felt little like... Like here it was</br>   swirling and here was swirling. It was kind of hard to describe, I felt it</br>   swirling, it's really weird. And I don't remember anything after that. Like</br>   anything after that, it was her telling me what happened, that I went to</br>   the room and fell asleep and she got worried because I wasn't waking up. So</br>   she went, slapped me, threw water on me, just did everything to wake me up.</br>   She called a friend, scared, he came over and he suggested calling 911.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So 911 came and they checked me, my pulse was getting slower. I</br>   guess they injected something to wake me up, it wasn't working. I guess</br>   they decided to take me to a hospital. They took me to the hospital and I</br>   guess they didn't have the tools to help with that, to help with the</br>   overdose, so they transported me to another place. And there, they had to</br>   put a tube down my throat and remove the liquid, and they put me to sleep.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I remember having dreams, I felt like it was a dream and I was</br>   fighting to get out of this bed, like trying to fight out of this hospital</br>   bed really hard. And just little moments where I had consciousness and I</br>   remember little parts, and yeah, I just remember fighting really hard just</br>   to get out. I felt really strong and unstoppable. And I guess one of the</br>   reasons is, I guess, the Vikings before going to battle would take this</br>   mushroom and they'd feel enraged and empowered. So I guess I was too then,</br>   right? And yeah, so yeah, that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: If you don't mind me asking, you didn't have papers at this time,</br>   right? Did you have health insurance, some kind of health care?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No. No, no, no.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So how did that work with having these hospital visits? Did you have</br>   really expensive bills? Did they cover it?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, it was only that one day, and actually the church paid for</br>   it because I would go to this church. And yeah, I guess a little silly</br>   thing happened, my pastor came... My mom called the pastor because I wasn't</br>   listening to the doctor. I guess I was unconscious or something, and the</br>   doctor was giving me instructions because they wanted to remove the tube,</br>   and I had to sit up or something. I was sedated and they would remove the</br>   sedative and I'd wake up and they would ask me to do things, I wouldn't</br>   listen. So they called the pastor and I actually listened to him. The</br>   doctor would ask me to do something, I'd be like, &quot;No, I'm laughing here.&quot;</br>   I'd be like, &quot;No.&quot; And the pastor came and I was like, &quot;All right, I did</br>   it.&quot; So they found out about it and they were nice enough to pay for that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Okay. That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. So I was really grateful.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How did your legal status impact your anxiety? Do you feel like it</br>   gave you more anxiety?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. It's like when I became aware of it, I told my friend and my</br>   friend was like, &quot;You should get a -- your green card, you know?&quot; And I</br>   guess ever since then I felt like... just judged, you know, like I felt</br>   afraid that somebody would find out. I was scared, you know? There was</br>   other people like me that... they wouldn't care, they'd share it, and I'd</br>   be like, &quot;Why? You know... Why?&quot; So it was really embarrassing for me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you tell your friends or people at school?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, I’ve only one friend. I guess the feedback that he gave me,</br>   it's like I guess I didn't want to tell anybody. I felt really like...</br>   Yeah, I guess just ashamed for it. And then just scared, the police,</br>   they're going to ask me if I'm legal or not. And it became even more scary</br>   when I was in high school, middle school, and I was with the bad crowd and</br>   we bought some cans and spray painted this church. And the church was</br>   really nice. They didn't put charges and when we were cleaning they took us</br>   to eat. They were just really nice, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: And so, when that happened, the police, they talked with me and my</br>   mom, they were like, &quot;Hey, we know you're illegal. You know? We're not</br>   going to report you to immigration. We just want a clean community, we just</br>   don't want any problems.&quot; But still, it's like now they know. It's like,</br>   they know. Next time I do something, it's going to be, I guess, I'm just</br>   going to get kicked out or something. So it just created a fear.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So that made you really nervous.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Anytime I had an encounter with the police, it just like... Oh, I</br>   have to say like red and white or something. I'd just really just feel very</br>   panicked inside. And it didn't help that sometimes I guess they'd tell my</br>   mom you know like, &quot;Hey, immigration's around, don't open the door, if</br>   somebody knocks check who it is.&quot; It's like dang, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's a scary fear to grow up with.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, it's like...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When did you find out that you were undocumented? Or did you always</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Nope, in high school. Around high school, like 9th, 10th grade. I</br>   guess that's what sent me down to depression because it was like 9th grade,</br>   you transition from middle school to 9th, it's a big change and then you</br>   find out this. And obviously, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So finding out about being undocumented kind of made everything</br>   worse?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. It just added onto it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then you mention in the survey about, when we were talking about</br>   whether you feel safe in Mexico, and you said that at least you don't have</br>   the fear of the authorities that you have in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. When I came I was so relieved. I'm like, &quot;Awesome. I'm</br>   legal. I feel legal.&quot; That was nice, and then it's like, &quot;Now what?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: But in that way, do you feel less afraid?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, I felt relieved, I felt free. And that was nice.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Had you ever felt free like that before in your life?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Ever since I found out [I was undocumented], no, because I felt</br>   like I'm always doing something wrong. I could just be here and [in US] I</br>   feel like, I don't know, like I'm doing something wrong. And I didn't even</br>   want to work, with pap-</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: In order to work, you got to forage for papers and I didn't want</br>   to do all that at first. I didn't want to do that, but it's like I guess I</br>   have to.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah. What choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, what choice, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then what was your adjustment like coming back to Mexico? What</br>   was, let's say first, what was the hardest part about adjusting to life</br>   here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess just knowing what to do. I guess just first accepting the</br>   fact that I was just going to work in the field and I had nowhere else to</br>   go. Just like life was harder there... Just learning how to interact with</br>   people here, because they have a different way of communicating. It's like,</br>   you've got to communicate the way they do, otherwise you're like, I don't</br>   know, like, outcast.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Communicate in what way?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Like here people talk to each other with like jokes and stuff all</br>   the time, Mexicans, all the time. And sometimes you're left out because you</br>   don't understand what... It's like puns or something like that. They say</br>   something, but it means something else, and there's a lot of that. It's</br>   like you say one thing and then it's not... it doesn't mean that, it means</br>   something else. And so, you've got to like kind of learn to decipher that.</br>   It was really hard at first, I would always be out of the loop like, &quot;Wh-</br>   What?&quot;, because that was hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then speaking Spanish when you got here, was that tough?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, at first, yeah because I wasn't used to it. Sometimes I</br>   would say words in English, they'd just come out of me, and it's like, &quot;Oh</br>   dude, I didn't realize.&quot; You know? And they'd just be like, &quot;What?&quot; And</br>   just, yeah, I guess learning all these new words, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Mm-hmm (affirmative). What's been the best part about being back in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well... I guess learning to speak Spanish better. Just feeling</br>   more free, like I can go wherever I want. Police aren't going to be looking</br>   at me, I don't have to worry about them. Whoa... Now with police are</br>   assholes sometimes, I guess everywhere they're that way. They're like that</br>   everywhere, right? But just that fear of like, &quot;I don't know what's going</br>   to happen. They're just going to send me away&quot;, and stuff like, &quot;I don't</br>   know what's going to happen.&quot; I guess that's gone.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: But you're separated from your family. Was that your parents, and</br>   sister?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. I mean, I guess I chose to do that to myself. I just didn't</br>   know it was going to be that hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So being away from your family is harder than you thought it would</br>   be?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, at first like, &quot;I'm free.&quot; By a year I was like, &quot;I'm good.&quot;</br>   And then it's like two years, it's like, &quot;Okay, well, when am I going to</br>   see them?&quot; I'm like, &quot;This is...&quot; Yeah, I guess you start feeling it. It</br>   took me awhile. I was like, &quot;Dang, am I ever going to see them?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And you said you have an uncle that was deported?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, but I wasn't really that close to him. I just know he's my</br>   uncle.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So you don't have any close family members here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, not really. Here in Mexico? Like here, here? No, I'm here</br>   alone. Like most of my family's in Nayarit. My grandma, my aunts and</br>   cousins.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you ever go to visit them there?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Since I came here? No.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's pretty far from here.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, it's like three, four, like 12 hours. Around there. Depends</br>   if you're going on an airplane or... Depends by what.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Is there anything that you feel like the Mexican government should</br>   be doing or that they could be doing differently to support return migrants</br>   like you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well yeah, I guess... A lot of people here have trouble with their</br>   papers, like school papers. They probably graduated or they have college</br>   and they come here and it's like they have nothing. Maybe something to</br>   accommodate that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yes, I've heard that from a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. That's definitely the number one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you have trouble with that, your papers from high school in the</br>   U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, I came and yeah they had to ask me for like get my</br>   transcript. I mean the school did give me my transcripts. Other people here</br>   have trouble with that, they won't get their transcript unless they were</br>   there in person. I mean, I guess I was lucky that I got those. I guess I</br>   didn't really struggle too much with that, but I see how other people do.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So making the education system easier to try to transfer-</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: To validate their studies, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So they can integrate to the schooling system here.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's huge. What about in the U.S.?</br>   What do you think the U.S. government could be doing differently in how</br>   they treat or how they support migrants, migrant families like yours?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I really don't really know how to answer that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's kind of a broad question. So maybe, is there anything that you</br>   wish average people in the U.S. understood about migrants? Migrants from</br>   Mexico? Is there anything that you wish people understood better about you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, I guess why they go there. It's not like they just go,</br>   just because they want to take away from them. You know? They do it for a</br>   reason. It's like if Mexico was as big as them, they would probably do the</br>   same, possibly. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So like, yeah, I guess. Yeah... Give them different people's</br>   viewpoints on why they go there. Yeah, don't just assume they just come</br>   over to take over.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, yeah. Understand that people have a reason for doing it.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And do you consider yourself more Mexican or more American?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well, I have no clue. I guess I feel more Mexican because I know</br>   that I was born here. I knew that I was not born over there. So it's like,</br>   I guess I feel more Mexican, but at the same time I feel sort of</br>   American-ish and Mexican American-ish. I don't know. I don't know, I don't</br>   know, I guess it's both.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Hard to know how to...? Like 50/50 or?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: 50/50. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Which 50% would be... Like, what's the American part of you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess just the culture, I guess. Yeah, I had Mexican parents,</br>   but it's like I interacted more with Americans, so it's like... I guess,</br>   the music. Yeah, the music, I guess. Yeah, not too sure. The lifestyle, I'm</br>   used to having more money, and the style too like... here I guess. Well,</br>   here in Mexico, it's more varied, but where I'm from, el rancho , they</br>   dress a certain way. They have their own style. I don't really follow that.</br>   You know, like they dress in their hats and stuff like that and like I</br>   don't really do that. Like the music too, I don't really feel like I really</br>   like Mexican music. It's like I'm forcing myself to do it because I want to</br>   fit in, but in the end I don't.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you feel like you stand out there?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, definitely. Like the type of music I listen to, sometimes my</br>   ideas are very different.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Like what kind of ideas?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess like my religion, I guess I was born into Christianity,</br>   and here it's like Catholicism, so it's like, my family is Catholic. It's</br>   like, &quot;Oy.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So not, yeah, not quite the same here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). It's like, I guess-</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do people treat you differently because of that here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean I had some friends who were like, &quot;Sometimes I've been</br>   discriminated.&quot; Like, &quot;Oh you're American&quot; tu vienes de alla because they</br>   know that I come from over there. Like, &quot;Nah, you're from over there,</br>   you're American, you can't be a part of this&quot;, or something like that. So</br>   yeah, then I'm , &quot;Nah, I'm Mexican too. I was born here. Yeah, I lived over</br>   there, but I was born here.&quot; So it's like, yeah they don't see me as too</br>   Mexican. I see myself as Mexican. It's because of that I said not too much.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: I've heard a lot of people say things where it's like you don't feel</br>   like you belong here, but you don't belong there either.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. There's a saying. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TYPO">Ni de aqui ni de alla.

And there I guess, it's   more about crowds, so it's like I had even less reason to really graduate   and I ended up just dropping out like when I was 18. And from there I guess   I got addicted to video games, like really addicted to video games. I   guess... I don't know, to escape, I feel like I had my reason, I guess that   was my reason to get good at that game, because that was my reason for   living, I guess.     Yordani: And the other... We moved away from town, where I would hang out   with all my friends and yeah, so I just isolated myself with some games. I   spent like five, like three, seven, four, five, six, seven years just doing   that. I got really bad, I guess my social skills got really bad, just lost   all my friends. Got new friends online that weren't really friends. I   didn't even know who they were. And yeah, I was just in a really bad state   of mind, you know? I hated going outside, it was so... I guess I didn't   know where to get help. I guess I had a computer, so I'd be on the computer   and I'd just research a bunch of stuff.    </span> Yordani: I guess I'll talk about how I was trying to...

You</br>   know? I was really like, that was the first, was... to do it on my own. You</br>   might just kill yourself, you know? So I did that, I went on research and I</br>   waited for the perfect time like when the rain comes. I went looking and</br>   stuff, I knew it was really dangerous, I was scared. At one point I found,</br>   outside, a mushroom that I thought was it, but I was just so scared to do</br>   it, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you buy them from someone or you found them outside?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, I found them. I read research on them and I found them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: You had to look at the texture, the color, and the feel of it, the</br>   size, everything. And I found it and it's like, well I feel like this is</br>   it, but there's many look-alikes and I don't want to die. I found this</br>   other mushroom, it was really colorful and this one was super easy to</br>   identify, and I read up on it and it said it had properties that would get</br>   rid of anxiety.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So, I found this mushroom and I prepared it, cut it up, put it in</br>   the oven, dried it, made tea out of it and I had it. And the crazy thing is</br>   when I had it, I guess it was toxic. I read a lot about it, it is toxic, a</br>   lot of people were like, &quot;But it's not toxic enough to harm you.&quot; And</br>   people report a feeling of less anxiety after they take it. And I did feel</br>   that, it did help.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So it did help a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). Yes. I felt less anxiety. So I was dumb. I</br>   was like, &quot;Okay. I guess if that took away this much anxiety, like if the</br>   more I do it the more it's going to have an effect. So I did that, the</br>   first time my mom found out about it and she didn't like it. I told her</br>   about it and I guess I have to hide it now, because she came home saying</br>   was like, &quot;Oh no, what are you doing? Oh stop.&quot; Got really mad at me. This</br>   one day I did it, I was like, &quot;I did it&quot;, and she came home from work and I</br>   had already done it, and I told her, you know? Just in case, because I was</br>   like &quot;Dang, what if I took too much?&quot;, because I did take a lot. And I took</br>   a lot, the dose was probably like more potent than the first one, it was.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So she came home and I was playing with the ball and all of a</br>   sudden I felt like the world was spinning, not like the other time, the</br>   first time it just made me sleepy. I drooled a bit and went to sleep. I</br>   woke up the next day and I felt those effects that I was talking about, but</br>   this time I felt the world spinning, I felt little like... Like here it was</br>   swirling and here was swirling. It was kind of hard to describe, I felt it</br>   swirling, it's really weird. And I don't remember anything after that. Like</br>   anything after that, it was her telling me what happened, that I went to</br>   the room and fell asleep and she got worried because I wasn't waking up. So</br>   she went, slapped me, threw water on me, just did everything to wake me up.</br>   She called a friend, scared, he came over and he suggested calling 911.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So 911 came and they checked me, my pulse was getting slower. I</br>   guess they injected something to wake me up, it wasn't working. I guess</br>   they decided to take me to a hospital. They took me to the hospital and I</br>   guess they didn't have the tools to help with that, to help with the</br>   overdose, so they transported me to another place. And there, they had to</br>   put a tube down my throat and remove the liquid, and they put me to sleep.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I remember having dreams, I felt like it was a dream and I was</br>   fighting to get out of this bed, like trying to fight out of this hospital</br>   bed really hard. And just little moments where I had consciousness and I</br>   remember little parts, and yeah, I just remember fighting really hard just</br>   to get out. I felt really strong and unstoppable. And I guess one of the</br>   reasons is, I guess, the Vikings before going to battle would take this</br>   mushroom and they'd feel enraged and empowered. So I guess I was too then,</br>   right? And yeah, so yeah, that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: If you don't mind me asking, you didn't have papers at this time,</br>   right? Did you have health insurance, some kind of health care?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No. No, no, no.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So how did that work with having these hospital visits? Did you have</br>   really expensive bills? Did they cover it?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, it was only that one day, and actually the church paid for</br>   it because I would go to this church. And yeah, I guess a little silly</br>   thing happened, my pastor came... My mom called the pastor because I wasn't</br>   listening to the doctor. I guess I was unconscious or something, and the</br>   doctor was giving me instructions because they wanted to remove the tube,</br>   and I had to sit up or something. I was sedated and they would remove the</br>   sedative and I'd wake up and they would ask me to do things, I wouldn't</br>   listen. So they called the pastor and I actually listened to him. The</br>   doctor would ask me to do something, I'd be like, &quot;No, I'm laughing here.&quot;</br>   I'd be like, &quot;No.&quot; And the pastor came and I was like, &quot;All right, I did</br>   it.&quot; So they found out about it and they were nice enough to pay for that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Okay. That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. So I was really grateful.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How did your legal status impact your anxiety? Do you feel like it</br>   gave you more anxiety?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. It's like when I became aware of it, I told my friend and my</br>   friend was like, &quot;You should get a -- your green card, you know?&quot; And I</br>   guess ever since then I felt like... just judged, you know, like I felt</br>   afraid that somebody would find out. I was scared, you know? There was</br>   other people like me that... they wouldn't care, they'd share it, and I'd</br>   be like, &quot;Why? You know... Why?&quot; So it was really embarrassing for me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you tell your friends or people at school?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, I’ve only one friend. I guess the feedback that he gave me,</br>   it's like I guess I didn't want to tell anybody. I felt really like...</br>   Yeah, I guess just ashamed for it. And then just scared, the police,</br>   they're going to ask me if I'm legal or not. And it became even more scary</br>   when I was in high school, middle school, and I was with the bad crowd and</br>   we bought some cans and spray painted this church. And the church was</br>   really nice. They didn't put charges and when we were cleaning they took us</br>   to eat. They were just really nice, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: And so, when that happened, the police, they talked with me and my</br>   mom, they were like, &quot;Hey, we know you're illegal. You know? We're not</br>   going to report you to immigration. We just want a clean community, we just</br>   don't want any problems.&quot; But still, it's like now they know. It's like,</br>   they know. Next time I do something, it's going to be, I guess, I'm just</br>   going to get kicked out or something. So it just created a fear.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So that made you really nervous.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Anytime I had an encounter with the police, it just like... Oh, I</br>   have to say like red and white or something. I'd just really just feel very</br>   panicked inside. And it didn't help that sometimes I guess they'd tell my</br>   mom you know like, &quot;Hey, immigration's around, don't open the door, if</br>   somebody knocks check who it is.&quot; It's like dang, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's a scary fear to grow up with.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, it's like...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When did you find out that you were undocumented? Or did you always</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Nope, in high school. Around high school, like 9th, 10th grade. I</br>   guess that's what sent me down to depression because it was like 9th grade,</br>   you transition from middle school to 9th, it's a big change and then you</br>   find out this. And obviously, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So finding out about being undocumented kind of made everything</br>   worse?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. It just added onto it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then you mention in the survey about, when we were talking about</br>   whether you feel safe in Mexico, and you said that at least you don't have</br>   the fear of the authorities that you have in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. When I came I was so relieved. I'm like, &quot;Awesome. I'm</br>   legal. I feel legal.&quot; That was nice, and then it's like, &quot;Now what?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: But in that way, do you feel less afraid?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, I felt relieved, I felt free. And that was nice.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Had you ever felt free like that before in your life?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Ever since I found out [I was undocumented], no, because I felt</br>   like I'm always doing something wrong. I could just be here and [in US] I</br>   feel like, I don't know, like I'm doing something wrong. And I didn't even</br>   want to work, with pap-</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: In order to work, you got to forage for papers and I didn't want</br>   to do all that at first. I didn't want to do that, but it's like I guess I</br>   have to.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah. What choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, what choice, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then what was your adjustment like coming back to Mexico? What</br>   was, let's say first, what was the hardest part about adjusting to life</br>   here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess just knowing what to do. I guess just first accepting the</br>   fact that I was just going to work in the field and I had nowhere else to</br>   go. Just like life was harder there... Just learning how to interact with</br>   people here, because they have a different way of communicating. It's like,</br>   you've got to communicate the way they do, otherwise you're like, I don't</br>   know, like, outcast.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Communicate in what way?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Like here people talk to each other with like jokes and stuff all</br>   the time, Mexicans, all the time. And sometimes you're left out because you</br>   don't understand what... It's like puns or something like that. They say</br>   something, but it means something else, and there's a lot of that. It's</br>   like you say one thing and then it's not... it doesn't mean that, it means</br>   something else. And so, you've got to like kind of learn to decipher that.</br>   It was really hard at first, I would always be out of the loop like, &quot;Wh-</br>   What?&quot;, because that was hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then speaking Spanish when you got here, was that tough?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, at first, yeah because I wasn't used to it. Sometimes I</br>   would say words in English, they'd just come out of me, and it's like, &quot;Oh</br>   dude, I didn't realize.&quot; You know? And they'd just be like, &quot;What?&quot; And</br>   just, yeah, I guess learning all these new words, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Mm-hmm (affirmative). What's been the best part about being back in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well... I guess learning to speak Spanish better. Just feeling</br>   more free, like I can go wherever I want. Police aren't going to be looking</br>   at me, I don't have to worry about them. Whoa... Now with police are</br>   assholes sometimes, I guess everywhere they're that way. They're like that</br>   everywhere, right? But just that fear of like, &quot;I don't know what's going</br>   to happen. They're just going to send me away&quot;, and stuff like, &quot;I don't</br>   know what's going to happen.&quot; I guess that's gone.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: But you're separated from your family. Was that your parents, and</br>   sister?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. I mean, I guess I chose to do that to myself. I just didn't</br>   know it was going to be that hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So being away from your family is harder than you thought it would</br>   be?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, at first like, &quot;I'm free.&quot; By a year I was like, &quot;I'm good.&quot;</br>   And then it's like two years, it's like, &quot;Okay, well, when am I going to</br>   see them?&quot; I'm like, &quot;This is...&quot; Yeah, I guess you start feeling it. It</br>   took me awhile. I was like, &quot;Dang, am I ever going to see them?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And you said you have an uncle that was deported?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, but I wasn't really that close to him. I just know he's my</br>   uncle.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So you don't have any close family members here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, not really. Here in Mexico? Like here, here? No, I'm here</br>   alone. Like most of my family's in Nayarit. My grandma, my aunts and</br>   cousins.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you ever go to visit them there?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Since I came here? No.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's pretty far from here.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, it's like three, four, like 12 hours. Around there. Depends</br>   if you're going on an airplane or... Depends by what.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Is there anything that you feel like the Mexican government should</br>   be doing or that they could be doing differently to support return migrants</br>   like you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well yeah, I guess... A lot of people here have trouble with their</br>   papers, like school papers. They probably graduated or they have college</br>   and they come here and it's like they have nothing. Maybe something to</br>   accommodate that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yes, I've heard that from a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. That's definitely the number one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you have trouble with that, your papers from high school in the</br>   U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, I came and yeah they had to ask me for like get my</br>   transcript. I mean the school did give me my transcripts. Other people here</br>   have trouble with that, they won't get their transcript unless they were</br>   there in person. I mean, I guess I was lucky that I got those. I guess I</br>   didn't really struggle too much with that, but I see how other people do.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So making the education system easier to try to transfer-</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: To validate their studies, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So they can integrate to the schooling system here.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's huge. What about in the U.S.?</br>   What do you think the U.S. government could be doing differently in how</br>   they treat or how they support migrants, migrant families like yours?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I really don't really know how to answer that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's kind of a broad question. So maybe, is there anything that you</br>   wish average people in the U.S. understood about migrants? Migrants from</br>   Mexico? Is there anything that you wish people understood better about you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, I guess why they go there. It's not like they just go,</br>   just because they want to take away from them. You know? They do it for a</br>   reason. It's like if Mexico was as big as them, they would probably do the</br>   same, possibly. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So like, yeah, I guess. Yeah... Give them different people's</br>   viewpoints on why they go there. Yeah, don't just assume they just come</br>   over to take over.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, yeah. Understand that people have a reason for doing it.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And do you consider yourself more Mexican or more American?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well, I have no clue. I guess I feel more Mexican because I know</br>   that I was born here. I knew that I was not born over there. So it's like,</br>   I guess I feel more Mexican, but at the same time I feel sort of</br>   American-ish and Mexican American-ish. I don't know. I don't know, I don't</br>   know, I guess it's both.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Hard to know how to...? Like 50/50 or?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: 50/50. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Which 50% would be... Like, what's the American part of you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess just the culture, I guess. Yeah, I had Mexican parents,</br>   but it's like I interacted more with Americans, so it's like... I guess,</br>   the music. Yeah, the music, I guess. Yeah, not too sure. The lifestyle, I'm</br>   used to having more money, and the style too like... here I guess. Well,</br>   here in Mexico, it's more varied, but where I'm from, el rancho , they</br>   dress a certain way. They have their own style. I don't really follow that.</br>   You know, like they dress in their hats and stuff like that and like I</br>   don't really do that. Like the music too, I don't really feel like I really</br>   like Mexican music. It's like I'm forcing myself to do it because I want to</br>   fit in, but in the end I don't.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you feel like you stand out there?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, definitely. Like the type of music I listen to, sometimes my</br>   ideas are very different.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Like what kind of ideas?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess like my religion, I guess I was born into Christianity,</br>   and here it's like Catholicism, so it's like, my family is Catholic. It's</br>   like, &quot;Oy.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So not, yeah, not quite the same here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). It's like, I guess-</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do people treat you differently because of that here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US">Yordani: I mean I had some friends who were like, &quot;Sometimes I've been   discriminated.&quot; Like, &quot;Oh you're American&quot; tu vienes de alla because they   know that I come from over there. Like, &quot;Nah, you're from over there,   you're American, you can't be a part of this&quot;, or something like that. So   yeah, then I'm , &quot;Nah, I'm Mexican too. I was born here. Yeah, I lived over   there, but I was born here.&quot; So it's like, yeah they don't see me as too   Mexican. I see myself as Mexican.

Yeah, I lived over</br>   there, but I was born here.&quot; So it's like, yeah they don't see me as too</br>   Mexican. I see myself as Mexican. It's because of that I said not too much.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: I've heard a lot of people say things where it's like you don't feel</br>   like you belong here, but you don't belong there either.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. There's a saying. Ni de aqui ni de alla. [neither from her</br>   nor there]</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you feel like that?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. I mean now I feel like more part of here now that I have</br>   spent more time here, so I'm getting used to it here. I guess I'm seeing</br>   myself more as a Mexican citizen now. I'd still like to go there though, I</br>   still want to... I don't know. I guess I was a citizen, I wish I was a</br>   citizen of Mexico and the United States. That'd be fucking awesome. I live</br>   here and then over there, it's like... Yeah, that'd be sweet.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: The best of both worlds.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: The best of both worlds.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then you could see your family more.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, definitely. That'd be pretty cool.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Well as we start wrapping up, because I know we got to get you back</br>   to class too. Is there any last thing that you feel like you haven't had</br>   the chance to share or that you want people to understand about you or</br>   people in your situation?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Let's see... Well, I really feel like this was all my fault. I</br>   hung out with the wrong crowd. I mean part of it was my status, but mostly</br>   it was my life decisions, you know? I hung out with the wrong crowd. I</br>   guess I didn't really have guidance. I ended up in a position where I</br>   didn't like being there. I guess I found the solution was to leave.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean that was my reason for coming over here. I felt so trapped</br>   in the game. I was like, &quot;If I just go over there, I'm going to be forced</br>   to not play video games. I'm going to be forced to reintegrate into society</br>   and just change, you know? Like, just coming back here is going to change</br>   me.&quot; And it did, I guess it worked, I saved myself, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean I was kind of dumb because I could've seeked help. I</br>   could've like... I guess I didn't know where, I didn't know where.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah. And I know I said we were done, but just one last question. So</br>   you're just finishing school now. What do you hope for, for your future?</br>   What are your thoughts for your future here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Yordani: Well, yeah. Yeah, definitely becoming a good software developer.   Just establishing myself as good. I mean, I don't want to be the best. I   want to be up there. I don't want to be the best. Like I want to set goals   for myself, I want to accomplish them. And yeah, maybe if getting a visa   doesn't work out, like my parents get deported, I'll be there to support my   mom.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Lack of mental health resources">Yordani: I mean that was my reason for coming over here. I felt so trapped   in the game. I was like, &quot;If I just go over there, I'm going to be forced   to not play video games. I'm going to be forced to reintegrate into society   and just change, you know? Like, just coming back here is going to change   me.&quot; And it did, I guess it worked, I saved myself, I guess.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Values, Time in the US, Friends">Yordani: Let's see... Well, I really feel like this was all my fault. I   hung out with the wrong crowd. I mean part of it was my status, but mostly   it was my life decisions, you know? I hung out with the wrong crowd. I   guess I didn't really have guidance. I ended up in a position where I   didn't like being there. I guess I found the solution was to leave.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Identity, Mexican, American, Bi-cultural">Yordani: Yeah. I mean now I feel like more part of here now that I have   spent more time here, so I'm getting used to it here. I guess I'm seeing   myself more as a Mexican citizen now. I'd still like to go there though, I   still want to... I don't know. I guess I was a citizen, I wish I was a   citizen of Mexico and the United States. That'd be fucking awesome. I live   here and then over there, it's like... Yeah, that'd be sweet.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Cultural differences">Yordani: Yeah, definitely. Like the type of music I listen to, sometimes my   ideas are very different.     Lizzy: Like what kind of ideas?     Yordani: I guess like my religion, I guess I was born into Christianity,   and here it's like Catholicism, so it's like, my family is Catholic. It's   like, &quot;Oy.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Identity, Mexican">Yordani: I guess just the culture, I guess. Yeah, I had Mexican parents,   but it's like I interacted more with Americans, so it's like... I guess,   the music. Yeah, the music, I guess. Yeah, not too sure. The lifestyle, I'm   used to having more money, and the style too like... here I guess. Well,   here in Mexico, it's more varied, but where I'm from, el rancho , they   dress a certain way. They have their own style. I don't really follow that.   You know, like they dress in their hats and stuff like that and like I   don't really do that. Like the music too, I don't really feel like I really   like Mexican music. It's like I'm forcing myself to do it because I want to   fit in, but in the end I don't.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Identity, Mexican, American, Bi-cultural">Yordani: Well, I have no clue. I guess I feel more Mexican because I know   that I was born here. I knew that I was not born over there. So it's like,   I guess I feel more Mexican, but at the same time I feel sort of   American-ish and Mexican American-ish. I don't know. I don't know, I don't   know, I guess it's both.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, US government and immigration">Lizzy: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's huge. What about in the U.S.?   What do you think the U.S. government could be doing differently in how   they treat or how they support migrants, migrant families like yours?     Yordani: I really don't really know how to answer that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in the US">Yordani: Yeah, at first like, &quot;I'm free.&quot; By a year I was like, &quot;I'm good.&quot;   And then it's like two years, it's like, &quot;Okay, well, when am I going to   see them?&quot; I'm like, &quot;This is...&quot; Yeah, I guess you start feeling it. It   took me awhile. I was like, &quot;Dang, am I ever going to see them?&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Language, Spanish">Yordani: Well... I guess learning to speak Spanish better. Just feeling   more free, like I can go wherever I want. Police aren't going to be looking   at me, I don't have to worry about them. Whoa... Now with police are   assholes sometimes, I guess everywhere they're that way. They're like that   everywhere, right? But just that fear of like, &quot;I don't know what's going   to happen. They're just going to send me away&quot;, and stuff like, &quot;I don't   know what's going to happen.&quot; I guess that's gone.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences, Language">Yordani: Yeah, at first, yeah because I wasn't used to it. Sometimes I   would say words in English, they'd just come out of me, and it's like, &quot;Oh   dude, I didn't realize.&quot; You know? And they'd just be like, &quot;What?&quot; And   just, yeah, I guess learning all these new words, you know?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Yordani: Like here people talk to each other with like jokes and stuff all   the time, Mexicans, all the time. And sometimes you're left out because you   don't understand what... It's like puns or something like that. They say   something, but it means something else, and there's a lot of that. It's   like you say one thing and then it's not... it doesn't mean that, it means   something else. And so, you've got to like kind of learn to decipher that.   It was really hard at first, I would always be out of the loop like, &quot;Wh-   What?&quot;, because that was hard.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being, Mental Health">Yordani: I guess just knowing what to do. I guess just first accepting the   fact that I was just going to work in the field and I had nowhere else to   go. Just like life was harder there... Just learning how to interact with   people here, because they have a different way of communicating. It's like,   you've got to communicate the way they do, otherwise you're like, I don't   know, like, outcast.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Crime and Violence">Lizzy: And then you mention in the survey about, when we were talking about   whether you feel safe in Mexico, and you said that at least you don't have   the fear of the authorities that you have in the States.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, High school">Yordani: Nope, in high school. Around high school, like 9th, 10th grade. I   guess that's what sent me down to depression because it was like 9th grade,   you transition from middle school to 9th, it's a big change and then you   find out this. And obviously, yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Hiding/lying">Yordani: Anytime I had an encounter with the police, it just like... Oh, I   have to say like red and white or something. I'd just really just feel very   panicked inside. And it didn't help that sometimes I guess they'd tell my   mom you know like, &quot;Hey, immigration's around, don't open the door, if   somebody knocks check who it is.&quot; It's like dang, you know?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Living undocumented, Learning status">Yordani: And so, when that happened, the police, they talked with me and my   mom, they were like, &quot;Hey, we know you're illegal. You know? We're not   going to report you to immigration. We just want a clean community, we just   don't want any problems.&quot; But still, it's like now they know. It's like,   they know. Next time I do something, it's going to be, I guess, I'm just   going to get kicked out or something. So it just created a fear.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Hiding/lying">Yordani: No, I’ve only one friend. I guess the feedback that he gave me,   it's like I guess I didn't want to tell anybody. I felt really like...   Yeah, I guess just ashamed for it. And then just scared, the police,   they're going to ask me if I'm legal or not. And it became even more scary   when I was in high school, middle school, and I was with the bad crowd and   we bought some cans and spray painted this church. And the church was   really nice. They didn't put charges and when we were cleaning they took us   to eat. They were just really nice, you know?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Living undocumented">Yordani: Yeah. It's like when I became aware of it, I told my friend and my   friend was like, &quot;You should get a -- your green card, you know?&quot; And I   guess ever since then I felt like... just judged, you know, like I felt   afraid that somebody would find out. I was scared, you know? There was   other people like me that... they wouldn't care, they'd share it, and I'd   be like, &quot;Why? You know... Why?&quot; So it was really embarrassing for me.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Illness, Healthcare">Yordani: I mean, it was only that one day, and actually the church paid for   it because I would go to this church. And yeah, I guess a little silly   thing happened, my pastor came... My mom called the pastor because I wasn't   listening to the doctor. I guess I was unconscious or something, and the   doctor was giving me instructions because they wanted to remove the tube,   and I had to sit up or something. I was sedated and they would remove the   sedative and I'd wake up and they would ask me to do things, I wouldn't   listen. So they called the pastor and I actually listened to him. The   doctor would ask me to do something, I'd be like, &quot;No, I'm laughing here.&quot;   I'd be like, &quot;No.&quot; And the pastor came and I was like, &quot;All right, I did   it.&quot; So they found out about it and they were nice enough to pay for that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Healthcare, Time in the US, Immigration status, Living undocumented">Lizzy: If you don't mind me asking, you didn't have papers at this time,   right? Did you have health insurance, some kind of health care?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Drugs, Taking, Time in the US, Illness, Healthcare">Yordani: So 911 came and they checked me, my pulse was getting slower. I   guess they injected something to wake me up, it wasn't working. I guess   they decided to take me to a hospital. They took me to the hospital and I   guess they didn't have the tools to help with that, to help with the   overdose, so they transported me to another place. And there, they had to   put a tube down my throat and remove the liquid, and they put me to sleep.     Yordani: I remember having dreams, I felt like it was a dream and I was   fighting to get out of this bed, like trying to fight out of this hospital   bed really hard. And just little moments where I had consciousness and I   remember little parts, and yeah, I just remember fighting really hard just   to get out. I felt really strong and unstoppable. And I guess one of the   reasons is, I guess, the Vikings before going to battle would take this   mushroom and they'd feel enraged and empowered. So I guess I was too then,   right? And yeah, so yeah, that happened.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Drugs, Taking">Yordani: You had to look at the texture, the color, and the feel of it, the   size, everything. And I found it and it's like, well I feel like this is   it, but there's many look-alikes and I don't want to die. I found this   other mushroom, it was really colorful and this one was super easy to   identify, and I read up on it and it said it had properties that would get   rid of anxiety.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Drugs, Taking">Yordani: And I read it online that you shouldn't do it on your own. You   know? I was really like, that was the first, was... to do it on my own. You   might just kill yourself, you know? So I did that, I went on research and I   waited for the perfect time like when the rain comes. I went looking and   stuff, I knew it was really dangerous, I was scared. At one point I found,   outside, a mushroom that I thought was it, but I was just so scared to do   it, you know?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Drugs, Taking, Addiction">Yordani: I guess I'll talk about how I was trying to... I thought I had   really bad anxiety, and I was finding a way to cure it. And I researched,   it's all like, &quot;Oh, you got to expose yourself and do this.&quot; And then   there's these mushrooms, I guess, that will help you, like psychedelic   therapy.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife, Being alone">Yordani: And the other... We moved away from town, where I would hang out   with all my friends and yeah, so I just isolated myself with some games. I   spent like five, like three, seven, four, five, six, seven years just doing   that. I got really bad, I guess my social skills got really bad, just lost   all my friends. Got new friends online that weren't really friends. I   didn't even know who they were. And yeah, I was just in a really bad state   of mind, you know? I hated going outside, it was so... I guess I didn't   know where to get help. I guess I had a computer, so I'd be on the computer   and I'd just research a bunch of stuff.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out">Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). Uh-huh (affirmative). You'd get less   credits, you had to earn less credits to graduate. And there I guess, it's   more about crowds, so it's like I had even less reason to really graduate   and I ended up just dropping out like when I was 18. And from there I guess   I got addicted to video games, like really addicted to video games. I   guess... I don't know, to escape, I feel like I had my reason, I guess that   was my reason to get good at that game, because that was my reason for   living, I guess.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, High school, Lack of mental health resources, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out">Yordani: So I went to 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade, not really learning. I   just got past, you know? And at the end, in 12th grade, the vice principal   called me, he's like, &quot;Hey, you're not going to graduate here, you should   go to this school.&quot; And they sent me to that school and that school was   like, it was full of people like me that didn't really care and -    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Feelings, Despair">Yordani: Well, I guess I was in school and I started doing substance abuse   and I guess I got depressed. It's like I wasn't really trying at school. My   friends were working all the time. I guess nobody like, could supervise me.   Yeah, I had bad influences. I hung out with the wrong crowd and I guess I   had no purpose for going to school. I said, &quot;Why am I even going to   school?&quot; I didn't even know. I didn't even like see a reason, a good reason   to go. So it's like it didn't matter to me.    </span> Yordani: So I went to 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade, not really learning. I</br>   just got past, you know? And at the end, in 12th grade, the vice principal</br>   called me, he's like, &quot;Hey, you're not going to graduate here, you should</br>   go to this school.&quot; And they sent me to that school and that school was</br>   like, it was full of people like me that didn't really care and -</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Okay. Like an alternative school?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). Uh-huh (affirmative). You'd get less</br>   credits, you had to earn less credits to graduate. And there I guess, it's</br>   more about crowds, so it's like I had even less reason to really graduate</br>   and I ended up just dropping out like when I was 18. And from there I guess</br>   I got addicted to video games, like really addicted to video games. I</br>   guess... I don't know, to escape, I feel like I had my reason, I guess that</br>   was my reason to get good at that game, because that was my reason for</br>   living, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: And the other... We moved away from town, where I would hang out</br>   with all my friends and yeah, so I just isolated myself with some games. I</br>   spent like five, like three, seven, four, five, six, seven years just doing</br>   that. I got really bad, I guess my social skills got really bad, just lost</br>   all my friends. Got new friends online that weren't really friends. I</br>   didn't even know who they were. And yeah, I was just in a really bad state</br>   of mind, you know? I hated going outside, it was so... I guess I didn't</br>   know where to get help. I guess I had a computer, so I'd be on the computer</br>   and I'd just research a bunch of stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess I'll talk about how I was trying to... I thought I had</br>   really bad anxiety, and I was finding a way to cure it. And I researched,</br>   it's all like, &quot;Oh, you got to expose yourself and do this.&quot; And then</br>   there's these mushrooms, I guess, that will help you, like psychedelic</br>   therapy.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: And I read it online that you shouldn't do it on your own.

So I did that, I went on research and I</br>   waited for the perfect time like when the rain comes. I went looking and</br>   stuff, I knew it was really dangerous, I was scared. At one point I found,</br>   outside, a mushroom that I thought was it, but I was just so scared to do</br>   it, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you buy them from someone or you found them outside?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, I found them. I read research on them and I found them.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: You had to look at the texture, the color, and the feel of it, the</br>   size, everything. And I found it and it's like, well I feel like this is</br>   it, but there's many look-alikes and I don't want to die.

And the crazy thing is</br>   when I had it, I guess it was toxic. I read a lot about it, it is toxic, a</br>   lot of people were like, &quot;But it's not toxic enough to harm you.&quot; And</br>   people report a feeling of less anxiety after they take it. And I did feel</br>   that, it did help.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So it did help a bit?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). Yes. I felt less anxiety. So I was dumb. I</br>   was like, &quot;Okay. I guess if that took away this much anxiety, like if the</br>   more I do it the more it's going to have an effect. So I did that, the</br>   first time my mom found out about it and she didn't like it. I told her</br>   about it and I guess I have to hide it now, because she came home saying</br>   was like, &quot;Oh no, what are you doing? Oh stop.&quot; Got really mad at me. This</br>   one day I did it, I was like, &quot;I did it&quot;, and she came home from work and I</br>   had already done it, and I told her, you know? Just in case, because I was</br>   like &quot;Dang, what if I took too much?&quot;, because I did take a lot. And I took</br>   a lot, the dose was probably like more potent than the first one, it was.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So she came home and I was playing with the ball and all of a</br>   sudden I felt like the world was spinning, not like the other time, the</br>   first time it just made me sleepy. I drooled a bit and went to sleep. I</br>   woke up the next day and I felt those effects that I was talking about, but</br>   this time I felt the world spinning, I felt little like... Like here it was</br>   swirling and here was swirling. It was kind of hard to describe, I felt it</br>   swirling, it's really weird. And I don't remember anything after that. Like</br>   anything after that, it was her telling me what happened, that I went to</br>   the room and fell asleep and she got worried because I wasn't waking up. So</br>   she went, slapped me, threw water on me, just did everything to wake me up.</br>   She called a friend, scared, he came over and he suggested calling 911.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So 911 came and they checked me, my pulse was getting slower. I</br>   guess they injected something to wake me up, it wasn't working. I guess</br>   they decided to take me to a hospital. They took me to the hospital and I</br>   guess they didn't have the tools to help with that, to help with the</br>   overdose, so they transported me to another place.

And I guess one of the</br>   reasons is, I guess, the Vikings before going to battle would take this</br>   mushroom and they'd feel enraged and empowered. So I guess I was too then,</br>   right? And yeah, so yeah, that happened.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: If you don't mind me asking, you didn't have papers at this time,</br>   right? Did you have health insurance, some kind of health care?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No. No, no, no.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So how did that work with having these hospital visits? Did you have</br>   really expensive bills? Did they cover it?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, it was only that one day, and actually the church paid for</br>   it because I would go to this church. And yeah, I guess a little silly</br>   thing happened, my pastor came... My mom called the pastor because I wasn't</br>   listening to the doctor.

That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. So I was really grateful.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: How did your legal status impact your anxiety? Do you feel like it</br>   gave you more anxiety?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. It's like when I became aware of it, I told my friend and my</br>   friend was like, &quot;You should get a -- your green card, you know?&quot; And I</br>   guess ever since then I felt like... just judged, you know, like I felt</br>   afraid that somebody would find out. I was scared, you know? There was</br>   other people like me that... they wouldn't care, they'd share it, and I'd</br>   be like, &quot;Why? You know... Why?&quot; So it was really embarrassing for me.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you tell your friends or people at school?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, I’ve only one friend. I guess the feedback that he gave me,</br>   it's like I guess I didn't want to tell anybody. I felt really like...</br>   Yeah, I guess just ashamed for it. And then just scared, the police,</br>   they're going to ask me if I'm legal or not. And it became even more scary</br>   when I was in high school, middle school, and I was with the bad crowd and</br>   we bought some cans and spray painted this church. And the church was</br>   really nice. They didn't put charges and when we were cleaning they took us</br>   to eat. They were just really nice, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: And so, when that happened, the police, they talked with me and my</br>   mom, they were like, &quot;Hey, we know you're illegal. You know? We're not</br>   going to report you to immigration. We just want a clean community, we just</br>   don't want any problems.&quot; But still, it's like now they know. It's like,</br>   they know. Next time I do something, it's going to be, I guess, I'm just</br>   going to get kicked out or something. So it just created a fear.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So that made you really nervous.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Anytime I had an encounter with the police, it just like... Oh, I</br>   have to say like red and white or something. I'd just really just feel very</br>   panicked inside. And it didn't help that sometimes I guess they'd tell my</br>   mom you know like, &quot;Hey, immigration's around, don't open the door, if</br>   somebody knocks check who it is.&quot; It's like dang, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's a scary fear to grow up with.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, it's like...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: When did you find out that you were undocumented? Or did you always</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Nope, in high school. Around high school, like 9th, 10th grade. I</br>   guess that's what sent me down to depression because it was like 9th grade,</br>   you transition from middle school to 9th, it's a big change and then you</br>   find out this. And obviously, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So finding out about being undocumented kind of made everything</br>   worse?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. It just added onto it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then you mention in the survey about, when we were talking about</br>   whether you feel safe in Mexico, and you said that at least you don't have</br>   the fear of the authorities that you have in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. When I came I was so relieved. I'm like, &quot;Awesome. I'm</br>   legal. I feel legal.&quot; That was nice, and then it's like, &quot;Now what?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: But in that way, do you feel less afraid?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, I felt relieved, I felt free. And that was nice.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Had you ever felt free like that before in your life?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Ever since I found out [I was undocumented], no, because I felt</br>   like I'm always doing something wrong. I could just be here and [in US] I</br>   feel like, I don't know, like I'm doing something wrong. And I didn't even</br>   want to work, with pap-</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: In order to work, you got to forage for papers and I didn't want</br>   to do all that at first. I didn't want to do that, but it's like I guess I</br>   have to.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah. What choice do you have?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, what choice, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then what was your adjustment like coming back to Mexico? What</br>   was, let's say first, what was the hardest part about adjusting to life</br>   here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess just knowing what to do. I guess just first accepting the</br>   fact that I was just going to work in the field and I had nowhere else to</br>   go. Just like life was harder there... Just learning how to interact with</br>   people here, because they have a different way of communicating. It's like,</br>   you've got to communicate the way they do, otherwise you're like, I don't</br>   know, like, outcast.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Communicate in what way?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Like here people talk to each other with like jokes and stuff all</br>   the time, Mexicans, all the time. And sometimes you're left out because you</br>   don't understand what... It's like puns or something like that. They say</br>   something, but it means something else, and there's a lot of that. It's</br>   like you say one thing and then it's not... it doesn't mean that, it means</br>   something else. And so, you've got to like kind of learn to decipher that.</br>   It was really hard at first, I would always be out of the loop like, &quot;Wh-</br>   What?&quot;, because that was hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then speaking Spanish when you got here, was that tough?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, at first, yeah because I wasn't used to it. Sometimes I</br>   would say words in English, they'd just come out of me, and it's like, &quot;Oh</br>   dude, I didn't realize.&quot; You know? And they'd just be like, &quot;What?&quot; And</br>   just, yeah, I guess learning all these new words, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Mm-hmm (affirmative). What's been the best part about being back in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well... I guess learning to speak Spanish better. Just feeling</br>   more free, like I can go wherever I want. Police aren't going to be looking</br>   at me, I don't have to worry about them. Whoa... Now with police are</br>   assholes sometimes, I guess everywhere they're that way. They're like that</br>   everywhere, right? But just that fear of like, &quot;I don't know what's going</br>   to happen. They're just going to send me away&quot;, and stuff like, &quot;I don't</br>   know what's going to happen.&quot; I guess that's gone.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: But you're separated from your family. Was that your parents, and</br>   sister?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. I mean, I guess I chose to do that to myself. I just didn't</br>   know it was going to be that hard.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So being away from your family is harder than you thought it would</br>   be?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, at first like, &quot;I'm free.&quot; By a year I was like, &quot;I'm good.&quot;</br>   And then it's like two years, it's like, &quot;Okay, well, when am I going to</br>   see them?&quot; I'm like, &quot;This is...&quot; Yeah, I guess you start feeling it. It</br>   took me awhile. I was like, &quot;Dang, am I ever going to see them?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And you said you have an uncle that was deported?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, but I wasn't really that close to him. I just know he's my</br>   uncle.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So you don't have any close family members here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: No, not really. Here in Mexico? Like here, here? No, I'm here</br>   alone. Like most of my family's in Nayarit. My grandma, my aunts and</br>   cousins.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you ever go to visit them there?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Since I came here? No.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: That's pretty far from here.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, it's like three, four, like 12 hours. Around there. Depends</br>   if you're going on an airplane or... Depends by what.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Is there anything that you feel like the Mexican government should</br>   be doing or that they could be doing differently to support return migrants</br>   like you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well yeah, I guess... A lot of people here have trouble with their</br>   papers, like school papers. They probably graduated or they have college</br>   and they come here and it's like they have nothing. Maybe something to</br>   accommodate that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yes, I've heard that from a lot of people.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. That's definitely the number one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Did you have trouble with that, your papers from high school in the</br>   U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, I came and yeah they had to ask me for like get my</br>   transcript. I mean the school did give me my transcripts. Other people here</br>   have trouble with that, they won't get their transcript unless they were</br>   there in person. I mean, I guess I was lucky that I got those. I guess I</br>   didn't really struggle too much with that, but I see how other people do.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So making the education system easier to try to transfer-</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: To validate their studies, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So they can integrate to the schooling system here.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that's huge. What about in the U.S.?</br>   What do you think the U.S. government could be doing differently in how</br>   they treat or how they support migrants, migrant families like yours?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I really don't really know how to answer that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: It's kind of a broad question. So maybe, is there anything that you</br>   wish average people in the U.S. understood about migrants? Migrants from</br>   Mexico? Is there anything that you wish people understood better about you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean, I guess why they go there. It's not like they just go,</br>   just because they want to take away from them. You know? They do it for a</br>   reason. It's like if Mexico was as big as them, they would probably do the</br>   same, possibly. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: So like, yeah, I guess. Yeah... Give them different people's</br>   viewpoints on why they go there. Yeah, don't just assume they just come</br>   over to take over.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah, yeah. Understand that people have a reason for doing it.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And do you consider yourself more Mexican or more American?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well, I have no clue. I guess I feel more Mexican because I know</br>   that I was born here. I knew that I was not born over there. So it's like,</br>   I guess I feel more Mexican, but at the same time I feel sort of</br>   American-ish and Mexican American-ish. I don't know. I don't know, I don't</br>   know, I guess it's both.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Hard to know how to...? Like 50/50 or?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: 50/50. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Which 50% would be... Like, what's the American part of you?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess just the culture, I guess. Yeah, I had Mexican parents,</br>   but it's like I interacted more with Americans, so it's like... I guess,</br>   the music. Yeah, the music, I guess. Yeah, not too sure. The lifestyle, I'm</br>   used to having more money, and the style too like... here I guess. Well,</br>   here in Mexico, it's more varied, but where I'm from, el rancho , they</br>   dress a certain way. They have their own style. I don't really follow that.</br>   You know, like they dress in their hats and stuff like that and like I</br>   don't really do that. Like the music too, I don't really feel like I really</br>   like Mexican music. It's like I'm forcing myself to do it because I want to</br>   fit in, but in the end I don't.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you feel like you stand out there?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, definitely. Like the type of music I listen to, sometimes my</br>   ideas are very different.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Like what kind of ideas?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess like my religion, I guess I was born into Christianity,</br>   and here it's like Catholicism, so it's like, my family is Catholic. It's</br>   like, &quot;Oy.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: So not, yeah, not quite the same here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). It's like, I guess-</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do people treat you differently because of that here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean I had some friends who were like, &quot;Sometimes I've been</br>   discriminated.&quot; Like, &quot;Oh you're American&quot; tu vienes de alla because they</br>   know that I come from over there. Like, &quot;Nah, you're from over there,</br>   you're American, you can't be a part of this&quot;, or something like that. So</br>   yeah, then I'm , &quot;Nah, I'm Mexican too. I was born here. Yeah, I lived over</br>   there, but I was born here.&quot; So it's like, yeah they don't see me as too</br>   Mexican. I see myself as Mexican. It's because of that I said not too much.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: I've heard a lot of people say things where it's like you don't feel</br>   like you belong here, but you don't belong there either.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. There's a saying. Ni de aqui ni de alla. [neither from her</br>   nor there]</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Do you feel like that?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. I mean now I feel like more part of here now that I have</br>   spent more time here, so I'm getting used to it here. I guess I'm seeing</br>   myself more as a Mexican citizen now. I'd still like to go there though, I</br>   still want to... I don't know. I guess I was a citizen, I wish I was a</br>   citizen of Mexico and the United States. That'd be fucking awesome. I live</br>   here and then over there, it's like... Yeah, that'd be sweet.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: The best of both worlds.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: The best of both worlds.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: And then you could see your family more.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah, definitely. That'd be pretty cool.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Well as we start wrapping up, because I know we got to get you back</br>   to class too. Is there any last thing that you feel like you haven't had</br>   the chance to share or that you want people to understand about you or</br>   people in your situation?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Let's see... Well, I really feel like this was all my fault. I</br>   hung out with the wrong crowd. I mean part of it was my status, but mostly</br>   it was my life decisions, you know? I hung out with the wrong crowd. I</br>   guess I didn't really have guidance. I ended up in a position where I</br>   didn't like being there. I guess I found the solution was to leave.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean that was my reason for coming over here. I felt so trapped</br>   in the game. I was like, &quot;If I just go over there, I'm going to be forced</br>   to not play video games. I'm going to be forced to reintegrate into society</br>   and just change, you know? Like, just coming back here is going to change</br>   me.&quot; And it did, I guess it worked, I saved myself, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I mean I was kind of dumb because I could've seeked help. I</br>   could've like... I guess I didn't know where, I didn't know where.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: Yeah. And I know I said we were done, but just one last question. So</br>   you're just finishing school now. What do you hope for, for your future?</br>   What are your thoughts for your future here?</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Well, yeah. Yeah, definitely becoming a good software developer.</br>   Just establishing myself as good. I mean, I don't want to be the best. I</br>   want to be up there. I don't want to be the best. Like I want to set goals</br>   for myself, I want to accomplish them. And yeah, maybe if getting a visa</br>   doesn't work out, like my parents get deported, I'll be there to support my</br>   mom.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: I guess them bringing me over there did teach me English. It did</br>   give me like... It put me in a better place than most people here. So I'd</br>   say, I guess I want to give back to them. I guess that's part of the</br>   Mexican culture too, is to give back. So I guess I want to do that, also</br>   for myself, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzy: To be able to support yourself, but also your family if they need</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Yordani: Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
