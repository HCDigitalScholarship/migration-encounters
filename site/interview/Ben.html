 Ben: Yes.<br>

      <br>
</span> Anne: So, obviously, you don't have any memories of that. But why did your</br> parents decide to take you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, they decided to take me because of hardships here. My father</br> had already left to the United States. He was already working over there</br> when I was born. My brother was over, I had an older brother, but he left</br> to go work over there. Then, once I was born, he came back, gathered my</br> mother, my brother and I, and took us with him, back to Dallas, around the</br> outskirts of Dallas.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: He was good with horses, so he was working at a horse stable, a</br> very prominent horse stable, that caters to most of the people around SMU,</br> or Southern Methodist University, that keep all their horses there. So,</br> mainly it was to give us a better life, because things are bad around that</br> little town. There's no opportunities.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And how did you learn English?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: How did I learn English? English, when my father was working at</br> the horse stables of course I grew up around it because the owners of the</br> stables, they would talk to us in English and they would give us candies,</br> they would let us watch TV. But my father also had a tape recorder and he</br> had some English cassettes. And, when dad was at work, my mother would have</br> my brother and I sit there, and to us at first it was like a game, to be</br> able to punch the play and the rewind and all that. It did help and that's</br> the first actual learning encounter, as far as applying yourself to try to</br> learn, was that little recording machine.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you were playing this game with the tapes—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: With the tapes and stuff and then later we started elementary</br> school and then once I started elementary school, it changed. Well my</br> mother had a rule, she goes, &quot;No English inside of the house.” Before, it’s</br> “Speak English, speak English,” but once we started school, she goes, &quot;I</br> don't want you all speaking English here inside the house” to me and my</br> brother. And we used to think that’s because she didn't understand, but it</br> was because she wanted us to practice the Spanish.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And when I would get home from school when I was going to</br> kindergarten—my brother would get out an hour later—I would get home and my</br> mother would give me these little comic magazines, Mexican comic magazines,</br> and she'd have me read them. And then she would make me write letters to my</br> grandmother. So that's how I was able to learn a little bit of, keep the</br> Spanish and English. But English I did, I went through elementary, middle</br> school, went to tenth grade in high school, then I dropped out of high</br> school to go help my father. He started a small construction business, but</br> then he got sick and he was hospitalized for three months.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And then after dad got better and went back to work, I still</br> stayed working there and then I need to go back to school. I didn't want to</br> go back and start and be behind the class. So, I became aware of the GED</br> program. So, I went and took the GED program, I didn't even study for it, I</br> just went and took it and passed it. And I started taking community college</br> courses before my classmates graduated [Laughing]. Already had a jump on</br> them!</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I thought it was too, but I still miss the graduation experience</br> and all that. I missed out on that, but regardless, I kept going and I just</br> went mainly into construction, stayed with drywall and did really well.</br> When I married Bena, I started a business of my own and it struggled at</br> first, but then I was persistent and everything just, it just changed from</br> one day to another. But it was really rough going at first; it was like</br> working, working and then this money comes in and then it goes all out. And</br> then finally, poof and from there everything changed.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, when you were in high school, did you feel like just any other</br> American kid?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh yeah. Yeah. Yes, I felt normal, I had a lot of friends and our</br> high school, the high school I went to, there was very few Hispanics-</br> period, very few blacks. If you looked at that high school, if you pulled</br> it up—well actually they made them remove the confederate flag, because the</br> confederate flag was part of, it was the school football team logo and it</br> was on their helmets. They were called the Southland Prairie Warriors, and</br> when they ran out on the football field, they carried the confederate</br> flag—and the high school flew the confederate flag up with the Texas and US</br> flag—which it would make you think the opposite. I can't say that the</br> school was…Of course there were a few people, but I did okay. I didn't feel</br> out of place and I felt pretty well accepted by others.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And did your mom work too? Or just your dad?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: My mom, she worked quite a bit, but there was a period when my</br> youngest sister was born, she ceased from working and she stayed home with</br> her for a few years. And then once—I think my sister was about four years</br> old—then she went back and started working again until we were doing good</br> in the construction. When I jumped into the construction and started my own</br> business, then my dad went to work for me. And when he went to work for me,</br> then my mother didn't have to work any more. We were really doing pretty</br> well, we did pretty well. Did a lot of construction projects all throughout</br> the Midwest and eastern seaboard. Lot of government projects.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. A lot of low-income housing for the government.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you moved around, it wasn't a local company that just stayed—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I based my company in Indianapolis and the main reason that we</br> ended up based in Indianapolis is that I had a project going on in Akron,</br> Ohio, one in Indianapolis and then I had two coming up in the Kansas</br> City—in both-- Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas. And I knew it</br> was going to be a lot of jumping around, and I figured well Indianapolis</br> will be right in the center. So, I rented an apartment there for me and my</br> wife and my son and my daughter; my son was a baby, but my daughter, she</br> was like four years old, or three years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And then right about after that, we bought a house. Well, no, my</br> wife wanted to enroll my daughter in pre-K to get her going because her</br> age. Her date of birth and the cut off with the school, they won't let her</br> in for regular elementary school. So, she found this church and she told</br> me, &quot;There's this church that's got pre-K and we're going to get her</br> started there.” And I go, &quot;Well okay, go ahead.” So, we enrolled her there</br> and we ended up getting involved with that church and we were the only</br> Hispanics at the church at the time, whenever we did it. But they were good</br> to us and they still attend there.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: That church, they started building one year on, every year they</br> would add a year onto the school. And my daughter was one of the original</br> students. So, she's one of the original students. The first original</br> student to go all the way through the academy and graduate.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: What's it called?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Cornerstone Baptist Academy in Indianapolis.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you dropped out of high school to help with your dad because he</br> was sick and then you got your GED without studying.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you then went to community college. The community college, the</br> courses that you took, were they designed to help you with your business?</br> Did you think about that?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. The courses that I started taking were courses that I figured</br> would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For</br> instance, I took business management, small business management, was one of</br> the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--</br> definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance</br> because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real</br> estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor</br> in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,</br> but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in</br> Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the</br> opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that</br> much capital to be able to take that much more on.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, come these home equity loans, finance pulled money out of</br> the house, take the property, rent it out to somebody to pay that, or lines</br> of credit and then we'd do a job, I'd get the money, pay that loan off, and</br> free that line of credit up later on. But apart from that, I did take all</br> the basic arts classes, English, algebra, I had some calculus and</br> trigonometry. I taught those at our private school, where my kids went to,</br> later as a substitute.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you were in Texas initially, is that where you got married?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes, in Texas.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Your wife. When did the business start blossoming to help you move</br> out of Texas?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: The business started blossoming when we were in Texas. I had told</br> my wife to give me…Within five years we'll have a house and we'll both have</br> good vehicles, dependable vehicles, but it's going to take a while. Well</br> within a year and a half from when I started, we bought out first house and</br> we both had good, dependable vehicles. However, it was still tight when I</br> took a project on in Akron, Ohio. And when I took that project on, I did</br> not want to go up there for many reasons. One, because I had this</br> immigration issue on me and I'm going near the Canadian border. Another, I</br> didn't really want to be away from my family.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But when these customers get persistent, &quot;What's it going to take?</br> What's it going to take?&quot; And I said, &quot;It's just out of the question. I</br> can't go up there, I got all these jobs going on. Plus, I got bad</br> equipment, my equipment’s old and if my equipment breaks down up there, I'm</br> not going to be able to meet the schedules and we're all going to be in</br> trouble.” &quot;Is that it? Really?&quot; The last price he had upped the price of</br> what the contract was to pay, and the pay was fine. I had other reasons why</br> I didn't want to go. Well when he says, &quot;I'll throw in a brand-new texture</br> machine on top of it, but I'll sign off on the paperwork after you complete</br> the project.” And I go, &quot;You'll do that?&quot; &quot;I'll do that and when have you</br> known me to not keep my word?&quot; And I go, &quot;Done deal.”</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: One of those texture machines, the price tag at that time was</br> about $30,000. Right now, it's probably closer to $40,000 because we're</br> talking about 1996. And he followed through, I came up to Akron, when I got</br> up to Akron though, they had projects, there were projects everywhere,</br> Kentucky, Michigan. And the pay, the pay was awesome. And that is where it</br> really, within I think about the second month that I was up north, it just</br> completely changed.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But I hadn't seen my wife and children since I had taken off up</br> there. So, I told her to come up there and visit and I started discuss with</br> her. I go, &quot;Look these other jobs,” and I had already said I was going to</br> take them, but I didn't tell her that. I told her, she says, &quot;What if you</br> go to be traveling?&quot; I go, &quot;It's worth it to be traveling back and forth,</br> but I'm not going to be traveling back and forth. We're going to just take</br> the kids; we're going to move up here and we're going to be together&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so that's when I moved them to Indianapolis. We stationed in</br> Indianapolis although I did travel quite a bit. I was on the road quite a</br> bit because I had later ended up with jobs as far down as Orlando, Florida.</br> And I ended up in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to repair a bunch of</br> apartments which we had worked on before. But it was a pretty wild ride,</br> but we really were doing really well, and it was really amazing.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. So, in Texas, you couldn't get a license, could you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I had a license, I did.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So how did you get it?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, the thing is that I had, when I was 19 I had a brush with</br> the law and I took care of it, but then ICE came looking for me, they</br> didn't pick me up or arrest me, but since they came looking for me, they</br> left their card there. And so, I voluntarily went in, but I knew something</br> happened, so I grabbed my driver's license, my social security card and I</br> tucked it away. So, I go into the offices and immediately they put me on a</br> pretty high, outrageous bond and—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: When you were 19?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, 19 is when I got in trouble. They came back looking for me, I</br> was already what? I think I was 27, going on, 27, 28.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, I go to the immigration office in Dallas and I went in and</br> then there they told me I was under arrest and then they shipped me to</br> Lorado. And I go before a judge in Lorado, and I go to fight this. I'm</br> going to have to sit here two years or pay $50,000 bond. And I go, &quot;No,” so</br> I just told the judge. I had an attorney, we had hired an attorney, but the</br> attorney, I knew he was just wanting to. I probably could've, maybe it was</br> a mistake, we could've won. But I did not want to sit there for two years</br> at a young age, two years and then at the end, maybe nothing.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I didn't want to waste two years. So, they deported me, I asked</br> the judge to sign, and I signed and that same evening I was on the bus to</br> Lorado, caught a bus to Saltillo, , and then this was a day before</br> Thanksgiving, when I arrived in Mexico. And then I stayed there in Saltillo</br> up through December, through Christmas. Christmas my parents came to visit,</br> and my girlfriend had come to visit too, my girlfriend had come to visit</br> around Christmas and then they left.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They were all citizens?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. And then we had plans to get married and my girlfriend, she</br> was willing to come live here, give everything up in the states and live</br> here, even though she's a citizen. So, I said, &quot;Well if you really feel</br> strongly then come on.” So, she came to Mexico and when she arrived here in</br> Mexico, I went to pick her up at the border, she came on the bus right</br> across from Eagle Path. So, I met her there and then brought her back to my</br> family's house.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Then we get there and we're there—and then my parents had arrived</br> there too—and she goes, &quot;When are we heading back?&quot; because she thought we</br> were going to Saltillo, because I told her it's a big city, better</br> opportunities there. I go, &quot;Oh we're not going to Saltillo.” She goes,</br> &quot;Well where are we going?&quot; I go, &quot;You think I'm going to sit here and years</br> later we're going to be worried about our kids, where they're at, because</br> you know they're not going to stay put here. They're going to jump that</br> border.” And I go, &quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; &quot;Well I'm going to take</br> that risk right now, I'm going to jump it right now.” She goes, &quot;No you</br> can't.” I go, &quot;You watch me. Let's go, we're leaving tomorrow&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, we left, and we went to Acuña across from Del Rio (Texas)</br> and then, &quot;No, just wait for me across the bridge. I'll be right there.”</br> So, &quot;No, no no.” So, I got a taxicab straight across the bridge. But I had</br> already had my Texas driver's license and social security card brought to</br> me in case they questioned me, then I could say, &quot;US.” And that's all I</br> did, just told them I was a US citizen, they just…It wasn't like it is</br> right now. Right now, even a US citizen is going to have trouble getting</br> across the bridge [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But over twenty, 22-23 years.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: 23 years? And were you worried about getting deported those 23 years?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Right after my daughter was born, yes, every day, the thought</br> would cross my mind. I had many brushes with Immigration, as we're in the</br> construction business. Many times, job sites would get raided and the only</br> thing was just to keep cool and walk straight up to them. Don't walk away</br> from them, if I seen them walking this way, I walked towards them instead</br> of walking away from them. I walked towards them.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, they probably, you being the head guy, they didn't think of you</br> as much—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, but during the raids I don't think they had any idea of who</br> was the head guy or not.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Because a lot of the times, a lot of these raids, I was all</br> covered in drywall, compound, white compound all over me, almost like if</br> you got paint all over me. But I just wouldn't…I would just walk right up</br> to them. And there was another gentleman—this was amazing because he didn't</br> speak English. And there was three times these raids that Immigration come</br> up and you're talking about over 10-11 people just scatter. He would never</br> run; he would stay put. And one time he was up on a scaffold and</br> immigration officer, it was one vehicle pulls up front and just one</br> officer, I knew that everybody else were all around in the back because</br> there was a big old wall.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, he finally gets out and comes inside the house and he</br> walks right past me and that happened a couple times where they would just</br> walk right past me, didn't even acknowledge that I was even there, nothing.</br> I go, &quot;Is God making me invisible?&quot; [Chuckle]. It really felt like that</br> because this time he didn't even acknowledge me, just walked right past me.</br> He didn't see me. Anyhow, he walks up to this other person, he's on the</br> scaffold and he goes, &quot;[Spanish 00:27:11] papels hombre?” and from up there</br> he goes, &quot;Yeah.” And pulls out his wallet, left him alone. Walked away.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And it was three times with that one person. And then after that</br> last time that I was with him that happened, he goes, &quot;Look at that,</br> they're taking all these poor guys that don't want to go. I want to go</br> back, I want a free ride back. But they don't want to take me.” And I spoke</br> to a cousin of his, it’s probably been about three years ago, and I asked</br> him about him, and he says, &quot;To this day, he don't have his residency, he</br> never got his papers.” He's living in Atlanta now by the way, or he was</br> when I talked to his cousin. His cousin goes, &quot;He's in Atlanta, but to this</br> day he never got his papers and he's never been deported.” And I go, &quot;Some</br> people are lucky and some are not&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you built your company, your wife was a US citizen?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And your two children?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: U.S. citizens.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: U.S. citizens and you sort of had a really nice middle-class life,</br> right?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. Real nice life. And my children, they didn't know that I was</br> illegal until it happened. And we had…Well there was a reason why we didn't</br> want them knowing because children can tell others. And then also they just</br> wouldn't understand. When they were a little bit older, like my son in</br> junior high and my daughter barely starting high school, do you remember</br> when Lou Dobbs went off on his rant? On CNN, when he started all that. When</br> Lou Dobbs started ranting, it was like every day on TV, the other school</br> children were talking about illegal ladies and this and this. And one day I</br> got home and my wife, the kids were already in bed, and she told me, &quot;You</br> know what? Vanessa came up and asked me if any of our relatives were</br> illegal aliens.” And I told her, &quot;Probably about time we started explaining</br> some things to her.” She goes, &quot;No, with our relatives yes, but as far as</br> you, no. You can't&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: So, we didn't. And it was just, once they did find out, I really</br> don't know, I'm really not sure how they really feel. But it had to be—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They didn't find out until you actually—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And they're adults now? Or young adults?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. And my daughter, I know it had to move her because after my</br> daughter, this is her graduating from Indiana University with honors, very</br> decorated.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Beautiful.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Her major is paralegal studies. She's still studying, she wants a</br> law degree.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And she did her internship at the Marian County prosecutor’s</br> office. She graduated and upon graduation—well before she even</br> graduated—she had secured a job. She's got a job, she's got her first job,</br> right now she's a paralegal for immigration family law.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh wow. Wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: So, I guess it has something—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Sure.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: My son, just barely last week he went to get settled. He was going</br> to IUP [Indiana University of Pennsylvania] in Indianapolis, but he just</br> got the Disney scholarship and it's a full scholarship, so room, board</br> everything. And he just got settled last week in Orlando. So, he's going to</br> be there for a little while.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And what school does that go for?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I'm not exactly sure, some university there in Orlando. I haven't</br> had a lot of contact since…They were busy over there, when they were over</br> there, I was busy heading this way.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, what happened? What happened to bring you to detention and</br> deportation?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, this last issue had to do with labor. I was used to these</br> labor department investigations and this last few really started getting</br> more intense though. I kind of think that it took a stronger turn with the</br> Obama administration, to focus on these contracts and make sure that all</br> the criteria in these prevailing wage jobs were really fulfilled to the T.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, for the federal contractors?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. And I'm an illegal alien, but you can look me up in the</br> Michigan records. And I'm registered there as a preferred government</br> contractor. I did well over 200,000 units and for Amtrak, which is in a bad</br> area of Detroit, and around other parts of Detroit, Wayne town. But there,</br> Indiana and Ohio, Florida and Mississippi, Texas, I was a preferred</br> government contractor. And did they know I was illegal? Damn right they</br> did.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They did?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I know they did. There's no way that they couldn't have known. Did</br> they care? No. They just needed their job done.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: At the end, I think they still didn't care but I think the heat</br> got turned up and they started—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's all you can think of?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: That's all I can do. But I'm still grateful I did very well and my</br> family's not hurting. If I felt that they were hurting, I would risk it all</br> and head back. But, they're comfortable, they're doing well. And I think,</br> well I feel that I set a standard for them, to strive to be more, to strive</br> because they all had, including my wife, when we married she was kind of</br> shy and her self-esteem—not that she had low self-esteem—but she really</br> didn't believe that much in herself. But right now, she's shining, she's</br> doing really well, and she's holding it together for both kids at that age</br> to still be living with her, other than my son right now in college, that</br> he went, that's to say a lot for two parents. But for a single parent, you</br> gotta hand it to her.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And when were you detained? How long ago?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: It's been about a year and a half ago, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you fought it for a year and a half?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, no, no. No, no. I had gotten, I was in, it was about six</br> months and then I got shipped over to Matamoras and I was at my family's</br> house, my family has a house here on the border.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I see.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I mean it's a nice house. It's up in the mountains and I had a lot</br> of family members, including my wife go, &quot;Why are you leaving? Why are you</br> going to Mexico City? You don't need to.” I go, &quot;Well one I'm going, I want</br> to be involved in helping these people. I gotta go out and do something, I</br> know I can still do something, I need a job. I need a job, I need a real</br> job.” Raising goats and sheep is fine and it was common people and stuff,</br> but I'm a busy body and I need to do something.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And then I became aware of New Comienzos and when I seen that,</br> that's what I want to do. I want to go down there, I want to be involved in</br> that. I want to be involved in that because that's something that I know I</br> can help and contribute to. And at the same time, I can get me a job down</br> there and I'll stay put. I'll come back and visit every now and then, but</br> I'm a city person [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. So, did you fight the detention or no?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No. When my first, I was detained when I was 19—well no, I got in</br> trouble when I was 19, detained at 27. That time, I signed away, I didn't</br> fight it. So, this time, I had no rights. I could not fight anymore because</br> I'd already signed away. This time around, I probably would've fought it,</br> because I had the money this time. Even if I knew I was going to lose, at</br> least I knew I had the money for the bond and I could put it off two,</br> three, four years. But, the first time I didn't have the money. So, I said,</br> “Sit here two years and wait and then probably get deported? No.”</br> Unfortunately, this time, I just, there was no rights that I could—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And have your kids or your wife been to visit you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes, they have up there. Hopefully once I get settled here. My</br> wife was supposed to come here in May, like around my birthday, which was</br> the week before last. But when my son got this scholarship, well he said,</br> &quot;We gotta go,” so her and my daughter both drove him down to Orlando and</br> they went to Disney, like we used to always go to Disney World. We would go</br> at least twice a year. There was one year that I had two projects that ran</br> over a year down there and I bought them season passes, because it was</br> easier for them to fly down on the weekend and come see me. And when they</br> come down, if you buy three individual park tickets, it's more expensive</br> then the season pass.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But they're still keeping up the traditions [Laughs]. They're</br> still going to Disney.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you spent a lot of time volunteering while you were in the</br> states.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, it seems like, does that make it a good fit to try it here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh yes. Yes, it's voluntary here, it's a different theme here.</br> It's a stronger, I feel it's a stronger theme. Not that my volunteer work</br> back over there wasn't, but my volunteer… Like helping out at the school</br> whenever I was in town, I would let them know that I would be in town and I</br> was available to substitute if one of the teachers needed a break or was</br> going to be missing. And I was qualified to take the classes on.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But I also was a volunteer English teacher when they started, they</br> started a Spanish church. When that Spanish church started, it was actually</br> my father that was the preacher. My father was at another church, but when</br> they wanted to do that, I talked to my father to see if he would, because</br> they asked me to, but I was honest, I go, &quot;You know I'm not that</br> knowledgeable of the Bible, to be able to. I don't want to stumble over</br> myself.” And you know when people are barely getting into a church and you</br> say one thing but then you contradict yourself, you're going to destroy</br> their faith.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Don't want to do that.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No. And I did a lot of volunteer work there at the church and the</br> school. It was great. And they've been right by my family's side, they're</br> still going to church there and anytime that they need anything, they're</br> right there. But good thing …. they've been fine. My wife, she's got a</br> pretty good job. She worked for a mortgage company, so she does pretty</br> well. And my daughter helps out too now that she's making money. It's been</br> a long ride. [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, we hear a lot of stories about young men who come over as babies</br> or toddlers and then for some reason get caught up in gangs or crime. What</br> was different for you? Why do you think that never happened?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, I can tell you that I think, probably the single most</br> important thing, the most important thing in a person's life is</br> environment. Parenting is important, but you can have the best parents in</br> the world, but if you have them in a bad environment, your parenting is not</br> going to supersede the environment. And that's one of the things that I</br> focus with my wife is that—well my parents, they provided a good</br> environment. And when I got married from my life experiences, I stepped</br> that up a bit. I told a lot of other relatives, this is one thing I've told</br> a lot of other relatives, this happens a lot in America—not just with</br> Mexicans or Central Americans, Blacks or whatever—is a lot of people yell</br> out racism or discrimination.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And I sincerely believe that sometimes we discriminate ourselves,</br> that we put it on ourselves, because we teach that to our children, because</br> weekends we all want to go get together with other relatives, other friends</br> of our own ethnicity. And that's not really what America's about and that's</br> not what I taught my children because that's not how I lived my life. I was</br> out with everybody, congregating with everybody, and that's the environment</br> that we brought our children up in. We brought them up in their church—I</br> was talking to you earlier, our church and the school that they went to was</br> part of the church. We were the only Hispanics.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But that doesn't mean that we didn't allow them or try to get them</br> to forget who they were. We didn't, because we brought them around our</br> relatives, but we let them see that environment and so that they felt</br> comfortable. So, when they got out into the world, they're comfortable</br> around anybody and they're not looking at colors or whatever. And they</br> don't feel like they're different and they don't feel different. I</br> honestly, I think I felt more different when I got back here [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Because it was really kind of weird. But over there I didn't, but</br> I think environment is one of the most important things. If you put a good</br> person in a bad situation, in a bad environment, sooner or later he'll</br> break. If you get a bad person that's never known what life is really</br> supposed to be about, guide him a little bit and give him a little time,</br> and if he's willing—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: It might work out.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah, it might work out.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Interesting. So, you achieved your dreams in America.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Do you have dreams now for yourself here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. My dream here is, one, to help here and I can't say it's a</br> goal that's going to be met. And the other is I'm going to have here what I</br> had over there and I'm confident that I can make that happen.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And will you make it through construction business, or will you make</br> it through…?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Right now, I think that there's other areas here that I could</br> probably succeed in without jumping into the construction business. We have</br> land back here (in the family home) and a buy little bit of cattle, make</br> some money here. There’s just several different ideas. But I know that I</br> can excel in a job here, because there's several people here that are</br> making some pretty high incomes and just, some pretty much as</br> telemarketers, but just there's some call centers with some good bonuses.</br> You're not going to get rich there, but you can make a good living.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But there's some opportunities right now.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: What do you think the Mexican government should be doing to better</br> integrate return migrants?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, I think that there should be a program where returning</br> migrant…Well, one, there should be at least some type of assistance, get</br> them a bus ticket and some type of cash, to get him back to his place of</br> origin. Job opportunities, some type of government incentive for employers</br> to hire new arrivals.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Some type of, I want to say grants, there should be some type of</br> assistance to help, some type of temporary housing assistance, maybe in</br> monetary assistance or vouchers, something. Not just dumping. One of the</br> things that's causing a lot of crime right along the border is you take</br> 1,000 people a day and dump them, right there on the border and they don't</br> have no food, they don't have nothing. And these gangs come along, they</br> have an endless army supply, they can supply their armies and never run out</br> of people as long as they're dumping people right there. Because you're</br> dumping people there with no money, no food, nowhere to go. There's</br> shelters, but them shelters are full.</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="7838238f-f8c3-43c9-b18b-151e92a357f0" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections">Anne: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Them shelters can't possibly hold all them people, they can't. And<br>
 so, all these people running around—they're running around the monument<br>
 right now—laying there around. I see them laying around, the same people<br>
 laying on the streets. But here in Mexico City, it's not that bad. You go<br>
 to the border and the border cities where all along the Texas border, those<br>
 are main dumping grounds for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. All<br>
 these border detentions that are on the border states, they're daily buses<br>
 are driving and dumping people off. Detentions from up north, they wait<br>
 until they fill up a plane, or planes, then they ship them. But here, they<br>
 catch. It's every day they're dumping people. And there’s gotta be<br>
 something done about that. I think that there's assistance for just about<br>
 any and everything else. I do think that it would be in the best interest<br>
 of the government to assist deportees that are coming back. It would<br>
 probably save them a lot of money—it'd probably save them more to get them<br>
 home and give them a little bit of cash, give them a bus ticket home to<br>
 where they're from, and it would be a lot less expensive than all the chaos<br>
 that's going on right now.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Seems that the US also has really ignored the whole problem, the<br>
 families that they're breaking up.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: You've thought about that, in terms of US policy, ways that they can<br>
 eliminate the hardship that your family is going through because you're<br>
 here?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: I mean not just the financial, emotional but everything. And it seems<br>
 like it’s not even in the equation.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yes, that's true, that's not even in the equation. [Pause]. That's<br>
 tough. But yes, I think [Pause] that [Pause] they're not looking at<br>
 individual cases when looking at this immigration issue. I mean if they<br>
 really, if the immigration person were really doing their job, then the<br>
 judge did his job and really take the time to look at each individual case,<br>
 some of these separations wouldn't happen. But they're not doing that, to<br>
 me they're just trying to pile up numbers. I know many a case where…Just an<br>
 example, one gentleman, taking care of his family, has residency, he's a<br>
 legal resident. One DWI and it's over with, he's gone.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: He's a legal resident?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: A legal resident. One DWI and that's it, he's gone. And I've known<br>
 of others that had up to three and they're still there. I know some that<br>
 have felonies and they're still there. Then one DWI, that's not being fair.<br>
 The biggest injustice I think is going after all these Dreamers and using<br>
 the information that they filled out on their DACA paperwork to go track<br>
 them down. I agree that there has to be some type of people should be<br>
 picked up, but they're not chasing those people. They're going for the easy<br>
 numbers because, you know what? Those guys they don't have paperwork where<br>
 they can go pick them up, they’re not going to school here, going there.<br>
 It's harder to catch them, so you know what? We can drum up 10-15,000<br>
 people right here, beef our numbers up. We got the addresses, let's just go<br>
 get them.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: And that's kind of what they're doing, not really doing their job.<br>
 Just to say that “We're doing something.” With 9/11, I remember that they,<br>
 within the first few days, 20 something hundred arrests that they were<br>
 attributing as terrorist arrests. But you know who they were picking up?<br>
 They were picking up Mexicans most of them. It was not 20 something hundred<br>
 Middle Easterners. But regardless, they were numbers. They had to show that<br>
 they were doing something. But that's that [Chuckles].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: The US, there's a lot that they could be doing, because they can<br>
 deport 100,000, but they know they gotta replace those 100,000 for the<br>
 workforce. One thing I know is I know the ins and outs of labor in the US.<br>
 That is one thing that I do know. And I do know that there's unwritten<br>
 policies that look the other way, look the other way while we get this<br>
 done. We need this done, look the other way. Hurricane Katrina was one, we<br>
 had immigration, immigration was about the only police patrolling the area<br>
 at the time and they weren't bothering anybody—it was hands off until they<br>
 get this cleaned up. And once all the toxic clean-up was out of the way,<br>
 then they started to enforce, but still not full force again.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: So, there's a lot to the government, part to blame there. Instead<br>
 of locking them up, they should really create some type of labor program.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: People can come and go.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: People can come, instead of coming across and, to me, instead of<br>
 somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could<br>
 pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the<br>
 US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do<br>
 that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private<br>
 business, they need to keep them costs down. It's like, would you like to<br>
 pay $30 for a Big Mac? [Laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: You’re saying that McDonald's is just using a lot of undocumented and<br>
 paying them really?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Well the whole concept of migrant labor, the migrant labor force,<br>
 is to keep the cost of products down and housing as well. If it wasn't for<br>
 migrant labor and this underground labor networks that are operating, a<br>
 $250,000 house would've probably cost you a million. And a lot of people<br>
 wouldn't be able to, a lot of people can't afford a $200,000 house<br>
 [Chuckles].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: No. Well I thank you very much.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Thank you all for coming, coming to help us out and spread the<br>
 news.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: You’ve probably been asked this question, but do you consider<br>
 yourself an American? A Mexican?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: You know, honestly deep inside, American. That's how I've always<br>
 felt. But right now, after this happened, it's like have you ever, there<br>
 was a book called The Man with No Country, are you familiar with that?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: That's, when I was deported, that's the first thing that, that's<br>
 what came to my mind, The Man with No Country, not here, not there, not<br>
 accepted here, not accepted over there. And when I got here it's like, no<br>
 paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a<br>
 driver's license, getting my voter registration—which is the main source of<br>
 ID here—the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.<br>
 And I was illegal in the United States and I was able to, anything I<br>
 needed, I could get over there. And here, I'm here, I had a hard time. It<br>
 took me a few months.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: It's really too bad.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah. Kind of rough. I don't know if it had been easier here, in<br>
 the big city, but over there it was pretty rough, hard getting around.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Well, I wish you the best of luck.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh, thank you—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: I think that you're, you think you're going to be fine, so I think<br>
 you're going to be fine. And you must be very proud of your family, they<br>
 seem really great.<br>
      <br>

 Ben: The US, there's a lot that they could be doing, because they can<br>
 deport 100,000, but they know they gotta replace those 100,000 for the<br>
 workforce. One thing I know is I know the ins and outs of labor in the US.<br>
 That is one thing that I do know. And I do know that there's unwritten<br>
 policies that look the other way, look the other way while we get this<br>
 done. We need this done, look the other way. Hurricane Katrina was one, we<br>
 had immigration, immigration was about the only police patrolling the area<br>
 at the time and they weren't bothering anybody—it was hands off until they<br>
 get this cleaned up. And once all the toxic clean-up was out of the way,<br>
 then they started to enforce, but still not full force again.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: So, there's a lot to the government, part to blame there. Instead<br>
 of locking them up, they should really create some type of labor program.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: People can come and go.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: People can come, instead of coming across and, to me, instead of<br>
 somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could<br>
 pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the<br>
 US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do<br>
 that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private<br>
 business, they need to keep them costs down. It's like, would you like to<br>
 pay $30 for a Big Mac? [Laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: You’re saying that McDonald's is just using a lot of undocumented and<br>
 paying them really?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Well the whole concept of migrant labor, the migrant labor force,<br>
 is to keep the cost of products down and housing as well. If it wasn't for<br>
 migrant labor and this underground labor networks that are operating, a<br>
 $250,000 house would've probably cost you a million. And a lot of people<br>
 wouldn't be able to, a lot of people can't afford a $200,000 house<br>
 [Chuckles].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: No. Well I thank you very much.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Thank you all for coming, coming to help us out and spread the<br>
 news.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: You’ve probably been asked this question, but do you consider<br>
 yourself an American? A Mexican?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: You know, honestly deep inside, American. That's how I've always<br>
 felt. But right now, after this happened, it's like have you ever, there<br>
 was a book called The Man with No Country, are you familiar with that?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: That's, when I was deported, that's the first thing that, that's<br>
 what came to my mind, The Man with No Country, not here, not there, not<br>
 accepted here, not accepted over there. And when I got here it's like, no<br>
 paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a<br>
 driver's license, getting my voter registration—which is the main source of<br>
 ID here—the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.<br>
 And I was illegal in the United States and I was able to, anything I<br>
 needed, I could get over there. And here, I'm here, I had a hard time. It<br>
 took me a few months.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: It's really too bad.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah. Kind of rough. I don't know if it had been easier here, in<br>
 the big city, but over there it was pretty rough, hard getting around.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Well, I wish you the best of luck.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh, thank you—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: I think that you're, you think you're going to be fine, so I think<br>
 you're going to be fine. And you must be very proud of your family, they<br>
 seem really great.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh, I am, they're going, they're moving forward, that was the<br>
 purpose of heading that </span><span id="3b252230-5671-48a5-a7a6-a71e49e325ad" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Deportation">Anne: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Them shelters can't possibly hold all them people, they can't. And<br>
 so, all these people running around—they're running around the monument<br>
 right now—laying there around. I see them laying around, the same people<br>
 laying on the streets. But here in Mexico City, it's not that bad. You go<br>
 to the border and the border cities where all along the Texas border, those<br>
 are main dumping grounds for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. All<br>
 these border detentions that are on the border states, they're daily buses<br>
 are driving and dumping people off. Detentions from up north, they wait<br>
 until they fill up a plane, or planes, then they ship them. But here, they<br>
 catch. It's every day they're dumping people. And there’s gotta be<br>
 something done about that. I think that there's assistance for just about<br>
 any and everything else. I do think that it would be in the best interest<br>
 of the government to assist deportees that are coming back. It would<br>
 probably save them a lot of money—it'd probably save them more to get them<br>
 home and give them a little bit of cash, give them a bus ticket home to<br>
 where they're from, and it would be a lot less expensive than all the chaos<br>
 that's going on right now.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Seems that the US also has really ignored the whole problem, the<br>
 families that they're breaking up.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: You've thought about that, in terms of US policy, ways that they can<br>
 eliminate the hardship that your family is going through because you're<br>
 here?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: I mean not just the financial, emotional but everything. And it seems<br>
 like it’s not even in the equation.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yes, that's true, that's not even in the equation. [Pause]. That's<br>
 tough. But yes, I think [Pause] that [Pause] they're not looking at<br>
 individual cases when looking at this immigration issue. I mean if they<br>
 really, if the immigration person were really doing their job, then the<br>
 judge did his job and really take the time to look at each individual case,<br>
 some of these separations wouldn't happen. But they're not doing that, to<br>
 me they're just trying to pile up numbers. I know many a case where…Just an<br>
 example, one gentleman, taking care of his family, has residency, he's a<br>
 legal resident. One DWI and it's over with, he's gone.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: He's a legal resident?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: A legal resident. One DWI and that's it, he's gone. And I've known<br>
 of others that had up to three and they're still there. I know some that<br>
 have felonies and they're still there. Then one DWI, that's not being fair.<br>
 The biggest injustice I think is going after all these Dreamers and using<br>
 the information that they filled out on their DACA paperwork to go track<br>
 them down. I agree that there has to be some type of people should be<br>
 picked up, but they're not chasing those people. They're going for the easy<br>
 numbers because, you know what? Those guys they don't have paperwork where<br>
 they can go pick them up, they’re not going to school here, going there.<br>
 It's harder to catch them, so you know what? We can drum up 10-15,000<br>
 people right here, beef our numbers up. We got the addresses, let's just go<br>
 get them.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: And that's kind of what they're doing, not really doing their job.<br>
 Just to say that “We're doing something.” With 9/11, I remember that they,<br>
 within the first few days, 20 something hundred arrests that they were<br>
 attributing as terrorist arrests. But you know who they were picking up?<br>
 They were picking up Mexicans most of them. It was not 20 something hundred<br>
 Middle Easterners. But regardless, they were numbers. They had to show that<br>
 they were doing something. But that's that [Chuckles].<br>

 Ben: A legal resident. One DWI and that's it, he's gone. And I've known<br>
 of others that had up to three and they're still there. I know some that<br>
 have felonies and they're still there. Then one DWI, that's not being fair.<br>
 The biggest injustice I think is going after all these Dreamers and using<br>
 the information that they filled out on their DACA paperwork to go track<br>
 them down. I agree that there has to be some type of people should be<br>
 picked up, but they're not chasing those people. They're going for the easy<br>
 numbers because, you know what? Those guys they don't have paperwork where<br>
 they can go pick them up, they’re not going to school here, going there.<br>
 It's harder to catch them, so you know what? We can drum up 10-15,000<br>
 people right here, beef our numbers up. We got the addresses, let's just go<br>
 get them.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: And that's kind of what they're doing, not really doing their job.<br>
 Just to say that “We're doing something.” With 9/11, I remember that they,<br>
 within the first few days, 20 something hundred arrests that they were<br>
 attributing as terrorist arrests. But you know who they were picking up?<br>
 They were picking up Mexicans most of them. It was not 20 something hundred<br>
 Middle Easterners. But regardless, they were numbers. They had to show that<br>
 they were doing something. But that's that [Chuckles].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: The US, there's a lot that they could be doing, because they can<br>
 deport 100,000, but they know they gotta replace those 100,000 for the<br>
 workforce. One thing I know is I know the ins and outs of labor in the US.<br>
 That is one thing that I do know. And I do know that there's unwritten<br>
 policies that look the other way, look the other way while we get this<br>
 done. We need this done, look the other way. Hurricane Katrina was one, we<br>
 had immigration, immigration was about the only police patrolling the area<br>
 at the time and they weren't bothering anybody—it was hands off until they<br>
 get this cleaned up. And once all the toxic clean-up was out of the way,<br>
 then they started to enforce, but still not full force again.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: So, there's a lot to the government, part to blame there. Instead<br>
 of locking them up, they should really create some type of labor program.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: People can come and go.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: People can come, instead of coming across and, to me, instead of<br>
 somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could<br>
 pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the<br>
 US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do<br>
 that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private<br>
 business, they need to keep them costs down. It's like, would you like to<br>
 pay $30 for a Big Mac? [Laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: You’re saying that McDonald's is just using a lot of undocumented and<br>
 paying them really?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Well the whole concept of migrant labor, the migrant labor force,<br>
 is to keep the cost of products down and housing as well. If it wasn't for<br>
 migrant labor and this underground labor networks that are operating, a<br>
 $250,000 house would've probably cost you a million. And a lot of people<br>
 wouldn't be able to, a lot of people can't afford a $200,000 house<br>
 [Chuckles].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: No. Well I thank you very much.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Thank you all for coming, coming to help us out and spread the<br>
 news.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: You’ve probably been asked this question, but do you consider<br>
 yourself an American? A Mexican?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: You know, honestly deep inside, American. That's how I've always<br>
 felt. But right now, after this happened, it's like have you ever, there<br>
 was a book called The Man with No Country, are you familiar with that?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: That's, when I was deported, that's the first thing that, that's<br>
 what came to my mind, The Man with No Country, not here, not there, not<br>
 accepted here, not accepted over there. And when I got here it's like, no<br>
 paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a<br>
 driver's license, getting my voter registration—which is the main source of<br>
 ID here—the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.<br>
 And I was illegal in the United States and I was able to, anything I<br>
 needed, I could get over there. And here, I'm here, I had a hard time. It<br>
 took me a few months.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: It's really too bad.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah. Kind of rough. I don't know if it had been easier here, in<br>
 the big city, but over there it was pretty rough, hard getting around.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Well, I wish you the best of luck.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh, thank you—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: I think that you're, you think you're going to be fine, so I think<br>
 you're going to be fine. And you must be very proud of your family, they<br>
 seem really great.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh, I am, they're going, they're moving forward, that was the<br>
 purpose of heading that </span><span id="7ccb7a1a-20f2-4657-9256-b67a07b25a25" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs, Community, Opportunity, Family Relationships, Feelings, Dreams, Reflections, Mexico, The United States">Anne: I see.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: I mean it's a nice house. It's up in the mountains and I had a lot<br>
 of family members, including my wife go, &quot;Why are you leaving? Why are you<br>
 going to Mexico City? You don't need to.” I go, &quot;Well one I'm going, I want<br>
 to be involved in helping these people. I gotta go out and do something, I<br>
 know I can still do something, I need a job. I need a job, I need a real<br>
 job.” Raising goats and sheep is fine and it was common people and stuff,<br>
 but I'm a busy body and I need to do something.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: And then I became aware of New Comienzos and when I seen that,<br>
 that's what I want to do. I want to go down there, I want to be involved in<br>
 that. I want to be involved in that because that's something that I know I<br>
 can help and contribute to. And at the same time, I can get me a job down<br>
 there and I'll stay put. I'll come back and visit every now and then, but<br>
 I'm a city person [Laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Yeah. So, did you fight the detention or no?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: No. When my first, I was detained when I was 19—well no, I got in<br>
 trouble when I was 19, detained at 27. That time, I signed away, I didn't<br>
 fight it. So, this time, I had no rights. I could not fight anymore because<br>
 I'd already signed away. This time around, I probably would've fought it,<br>
 because I had the money this time. Even if I knew I was going to lose, at<br>
 least I knew I had the money for the bond and I could put it off two,<br>
 three, four years. But, the first time I didn't have the money. So, I said,<br>
 “Sit here two years and wait and then probably get deported? No.”<br>
 Unfortunately, this time, I just, there was no rights that I could—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: And have your kids or your wife been to visit you?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yes, they have up there. Hopefully once I get settled here. My<br>
 wife was supposed to come here in May, like around my birthday, which was<br>
 the week before last. But when my son got this scholarship, well he said,<br>
 &quot;We gotta go,” so her and my daughter both drove him down to Orlando and<br>
 they went to Disney, like we used to always go to Disney World. We would go<br>
 at least twice a year. There was one year that I had two projects that ran<br>
 over a year down there and I bought them season passes, because it was<br>
 easier for them to fly down on the weekend and come see me. And when they<br>
 come down, if you buy three individual park tickets, it's more expensive<br>
 then the season pass.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: But they're still keeping up the traditions [Laughs]. They're<br>
 still going to Disney.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: And you spent a lot of time volunteering while you were in the<br>
 states.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yes.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: So, it seems like, does that make it a good fit to try it here?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh yes. Yes, it's voluntary here, it's a different theme here.<br>
 It's a stronger, I feel it's a stronger theme. Not that my volunteer work<br>
 back over there wasn't, but my volunteer… Like helping out at the school<br>
 whenever I was in town, I would let them know that I would be in town and I<br>
 was available to substitute if one of the teachers needed a break or was<br>
 going to be missing. And I was qualified to take the classes on.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: But I also was a volunteer English teacher when they started, they<br>
 started a Spanish church. When that Spanish church started, it was actually<br>
 my father that was the preacher. My father was at another church, but when<br>
 they wanted to do that, I talked to my father to see if he would, because<br>
 they asked me to, but I was honest, I go, &quot;You know I'm not that<br>
 knowledgeable of the Bible, to be able to. I don't want to stumble over<br>
 myself.” And you know when people are barely getting into a church and you<br>
 say one thing but then you contradict yourself, you're going to destroy<br>
 their faith.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Don't want to do that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: No. And I did a lot of volunteer work there at the church and the<br>
 school. It was great. And they've been right by my family's side, they're<br>
 still going to church there and anytime that they need anything, they're<br>
 right there. But good thing …. they've been fine. My wife, she's got a<br>
 pretty good job. She worked for a mortgage company, so she does pretty<br>
 well. And my daughter helps out too now that she's making money. It's been<br>
 a long ride. [Laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: So, we hear a lot of stories about young men who come over as babies<br>
 or toddlers and then for some reason get caught up in gangs or crime. What<br>
 was different for you? Why do you think that never happened?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Well, I can tell you that I think, probably the single most<br>
 important thing, the most important thing in a person's life is<br>
 environment. Parenting is important, but you can have the best parents in<br>
 the world, but if you have them in a bad environment, your parenting is not<br>
 going to supersede the environment. And that's one of the things that I<br>
 focus with my wife is that—well my parents, they provided a good<br>
 environment. And when I got married from my life experiences, I stepped<br>
 that up a bit. I told a lot of other relatives, this is one thing I've told<br>
 a lot of other relatives, this happens a lot in America—not just with<br>
 Mexicans or Central Americans, Blacks or whatever—is a lot of people yell<br>
 out racism or discrimination.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: And I sincerely believe that sometimes we discriminate ourselves,<br>
 that we put it on ourselves, because we teach that to our children, because<br>
 weekends we all want to go get together with other relatives, other friends<br>
 of our own ethnicity. And that's not really what America's about and that's<br>
 not what I taught my children because that's not how I lived my life. I was<br>
 out with everybody, congregating with everybody, and that's the environment<br>
 that we brought our children up in. We brought them up in their church—I<br>
 was talking to you earlier, our church and the school that they went to was<br>
 part of the church. We were the only Hispanics.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: But that doesn't mean that we didn't allow them or try to get them<br>
 to forget who they were. We didn't, because we brought them around our<br>
 relatives, but we let them see that environment and so that they felt<br>
 comfortable. So, when they got out into the world, they're comfortable<br>
 around anybody and they're not looking at colors or whatever. And they<br>
 don't feel like they're different and they don't feel different. I<br>
 honestly, I think I felt more different when I got back here [Laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Right.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Because it was really kind of weird. But over there I didn't, but<br>
 I think environment is one of the most important things. If you put a good<br>
 person in a bad situation, in a bad environment, sooner or later he'll<br>
 break. If you get a bad person that's never known what life is really<br>
 supposed to be about, guide him a little bit and give him a little time,<br>
 and if he's willing—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: It might work out.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah, it might work out.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Interesting. So, you achieved your dreams in America.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Do you have dreams now for yourself here?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yeah. My dream here is, one, to help here and I can't say it's a<br>
 goal that's going to be met. And the other is I'm going to have here what I<br>
 had over there and I'm confident that I can make that happen.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: And will you make it through construction business, or will you make<br>
 it through…?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Right now, I think that there's other areas here that I could<br>
 probably succeed in without jumping into the construction business. We have<br>
 land back here (in the family home) and a buy little bit of cattle, make<br>
 some money here. There’s just several different ideas. But I know that I<br>
 can excel in a job here, because there's several people here that are<br>
 making some pretty high incomes and just, some pretty much as<br>
 telemarketers, but just there's some call centers with some good bonuses.<br>
 You're not going to get rich there, but you can make a good living.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Right.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: But there's some opportunities right now.<br>

 family's not hurting. If I felt that they were hurting, I would risk it all<br>

 well I feel that I set a standard for them, to strive to be more, to strive<br>

 graduated—she had secured a job. She's got a job, she's got her first job,<br>
 right now she's a paralegal for immigration family law.<br>

 Ben: My son, just barely last week he went to get settled. He was going<br>
 to IUP [Indiana University of Pennsylvania] in Indianapolis, but he just<br>
 got the Disney scholarship and it's a full scholarship, so room, board<br>
 everything. And he just got settled last week in Orlando. So, he's going to<br>
 be there for a little while.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: And what school does that go for?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: I'm not exactly sure, some university there in Orlando. I haven't<br>
 had a lot of contact since…They were busy over there, when they were over<br>
 there, I was busy heading this way.<br>

 illegal until it happened. And we had…Well there was a reason why we didn't<br>
 want them knowing because children can tell others. And then also they just<br>
 wouldn't understand. When they were a little bit older, like my son in<br>
 junior high and my daughter barely starting high school, do you remember<br>
 when Lou Dobbs went off on his rant? On CNN, when he started all that. When<br>
 Lou Dobbs started ranting, it was like every day on TV, the other school<br>
 children were talking about illegal ladies and this and this. And one day I<br>
 got home and my wife, the kids were already in bed, and she told me, &quot;You<br>
 know what? Vanessa came up and asked me if any of our relatives were<br>
 illegal aliens.” And I told her, &quot;Probably about time we started explaining<br>
 some things to her.” She goes, &quot;No, with our relatives yes, but as far as<br>
 you, no. You can't&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: So, we didn't. And it was just, once they did find out, I really<br>
 don't know, I'm really not sure how they really feel. But it had to be—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: They didn't find out until you actually—<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: And they're adults now? Or young adults?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yes. And my daughter, I know it had to move her because after my<br>
 daughter, this is her graduating from Indiana University with honors, very<br>
 decorated.<br>

 you got paint all over me. But I just wouldn't…I would just walk right up<br>
 to them. And there was another gentleman—this was amazing because he didn't<br>
 speak English. And there was three times these raids that Immigration come<br>
 up and you're talking about over 10-11 people just scatter. He would never<br>
 run; he would stay put. And one time he was up on a scaffold and<br>
 immigration officer, it was one vehicle pulls up front and just one<br>
 officer, I knew that everybody else were all around in the back because<br>
 there was a big old wall.<br>

 I go, &quot;Is God making me invisible?&quot; [Chuckle]. It really felt like that<br>
 because this time he didn't even acknowledge me, just walked right past me.<br>
 He didn't see me. Anyhow, he walks up to this other person, he's on the<br>
 scaffold and he goes, &quot;[Spanish 00:27:11] papels hombre?” and from up there<br>
 he goes, &quot;Yeah.” And pulls out his wallet, left him alone. Walked away.<br>

 him about him, and he says, &quot;To this day, he don't have his residency, he<br>
 never got his papers.” He's living in Atlanta now by the way, or he was<br>

 within a year and a half from when I started, we bought out first house and<br>
 we both had good, dependable vehicles. However, it was still tight when I<br>

 about $30,000. Right now, it's probably closer to $40,000 because we're<br>
 talking about 1996. And he followed through, I came up to Akron, when I got<br>

 take them, but I didn't tell her that. I told her, she says, &quot;What if you<br>
 go to be traveling?&quot; I go, &quot;It's worth it to be traveling back and forth,<br>

 there. So, I told her to come up there and visit and I started discuss with<br>
 her. I go, &quot;Look these other jobs,” and I had already said I was going to<br>
 take them, but I didn't tell her that. I told her, she says, &quot;What if you<br>
 go to be traveling?&quot; I go, &quot;It's worth it to be traveling back and forth,<br>
 but I'm not going to be traveling back and forth. We're going to just take<br>
 the kids; we're going to move up here and we're going to be together&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: And so that's when I moved them to Indianapolis. We stationed in<br>
 Indianapolis although I did travel quite a bit. I was on the road quite a<br>
 bit because I had later ended up with jobs as far down as Orlando, Florida.<br>
 And I ended up in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to repair a bunch of<br>
 apartments which we had worked on before. But it was a pretty wild ride,<br>
 but we really were doing really well, and it was really amazing.<br>

 went mainly into construction, stayed with drywall and did really well.<br>
 When I married Bena, I started a business of my own and it struggled at<br>
 first, but then I was persistent and everything just, it just changed from<br>
 one day to another. But it was really rough going at first; it was like<br>
 working, working and then this money comes in and then it goes all out. And<br>
 then finally, poof and from there everything changed.<br>

 Anne: So, when you were in high school, did you feel like just any other<br>
 American kid?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh yeah. Yeah. Yes, I felt normal, I had a lot of friends and our<br>
 high school,</span><span id="a413baba-c7f6-4ea8-862d-5d3a8504e8d3" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Tragedy">Ben: And then after dad got better and went back to work, I still<br>
 stayed working there and then I need to go back to school. I didn't want to<br>
 go back and start and be behind the class. So, I became aware of the GED<br>
 program. So, I went and took the GED program, I didn't even study for it, I<br>
 just went and took it and passed it. And I started taking community college<br>
 courses before my classmates graduated [Laughing]. Already had a jump on<br>
 them!<br>

 Anne: So, when you were in high school, did you feel like just any other<br>
 American kid?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Oh yeah. Yeah. Yes, I felt normal, I had a lot of friends and our<br>
 high school,</span> the high school I went to, there was very few Hispanics-</br> period, very few blacks. If you looked at that high school, if you pulled</br> it up—well actually they made them remove the confederate flag, because the</br> confederate flag was part of, it was the school football team logo and it</br> was on their helmets. They were called the Southland Prairie Warriors, and</br> when they ran out on the football field, they carried the confederate</br> flag—and the high school flew the confederate flag up with the Texas and US</br> flag—which it would make you think the opposite. I can't say that the</br> school was…Of course there were a few people, but I did okay. I didn't feel</br> out of place and I felt pretty well accepted by others.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And did your mom work too? Or just your dad?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: My mom, she worked quite a bit, but there was a period when my</br> youngest sister was born, she ceased from working and she stayed home with</br> her for a few years. And then once—I think my sister was about four years</br> old—then she went back and started working again until we were doing good</br> in the construction. When I jumped into the construction and started my own</br> business, then my dad went to work for me. And when he went to work for me,</br> then my mother didn't have to work any more. We were really doing pretty</br> well, we did pretty well. Did a lot of construction projects all throughout</br> the Midwest and eastern seaboard. Lot of government projects.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. A lot of low-income housing for the government.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you moved around, it wasn't a local company that just stayed—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I based my company in Indianapolis and the main reason that we</br> ended up based in Indianapolis is that I had a project going on in Akron,</br> Ohio, one in Indianapolis and then I had two coming up in the Kansas</br> City—in both-- Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas. And I knew it</br> was going to be a lot of jumping around, and I figured well Indianapolis</br> will be right in the center. So, I rented an apartment there for me and my</br> wife and my son and my daughter; my son was a baby, but my daughter, she</br> was like four years old, or three years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And then right about after that, we bought a house. Well, no, my</br> wife wanted to enroll my daughter in pre-K to get her going because her</br> age. Her date of birth and the cut off with the school, they won't let her</br> in for regular elementary school. So, she found this church and she told</br> me, &quot;There's this church that's got pre-K and we're going to get her</br> started there.” And I go, &quot;Well okay, go ahead.” So, we enrolled her there</br> and we ended up getting involved with that church and we were the only</br> Hispanics at the church at the time, whenever we did it. But they were good</br> to us and they still attend there.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: That church, they started building one year on, every year they</br> would add a year onto the school. And my daughter was one of the original</br> students. So, she's one of the original students. The first original</br> student to go all the way through the academy and graduate.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: What's it called?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Cornerstone Baptist Academy in Indianapolis.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you dropped out of high school to help with your dad because he</br> was sick and then you got your GED without studying.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you then went to community college. The community college, the</br> courses that you took, were they designed to help you with your business?</br> Did you think about that?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. The courses that I started taking were courses that I figured</br> would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For</br> instance, I took business management, small business management, was one of</br> the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--</br> definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance</br> because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real</br> estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor</br> in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,</br> but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in</br> Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the</br> opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that</br> much capital to be able to take that much more on.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, come these home equity loans, finance pulled money out of</br> the house, take the property, rent it out to somebody to pay that, or lines</br> of credit and then we'd do a job, I'd get the money, pay that loan off, and</br> free that line of credit up later on. But apart from that, I did take all</br> the basic arts classes, English, algebra, I had some calculus and</br> trigonometry. I taught those at our private school, where my kids went to,</br> later as a substitute.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you were in Texas initially, is that where you got married?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes, in Texas.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Your wife. When did the business start blossoming to help you move</br> out of Texas?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: The business started blossoming when we were in Texas. I had told</br> my wife to give me…Within five years we'll have a house and we'll both have</br> good vehicles, dependable vehicles, but it's going to take a while. Well</br> within a year and a half from when I started, we bought out first house and</br> we both had good, dependable vehicles. However, it was still tight when I</br> took a project on in Akron, Ohio. And when I took that project on, I did</br> not want to go up there for many reasons. One, because I had this</br> immigration issue on me and I'm going near the Canadian border. Another, I</br> didn't really want to be away from my family.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But when these customers get persistent, &quot;What's it going to take?</br> What's it going to take?&quot; And I said, &quot;It's just out of the question. I</br> can't go up there, I got all these jobs going on. Plus, I got bad</br> equipment, my equipment’s old and if my equipment breaks down up there, I'm</br> not going to be able to meet the schedules and we're all going to be in</br> trouble.” &quot;Is that it? Really?&quot; The last price he had upped the price of</br> what the contract was to pay, and the pay was fine. I had other reasons why</br> I didn't want to go. Well when he says, &quot;I'll throw in a brand-new texture</br> machine on top of it, but I'll sign off on the paperwork after you complete</br> the project.” And I go, &quot;You'll do that?&quot; &quot;I'll do that and when have you</br> known me to not keep my word?&quot; And I go, &quot;Done deal.”</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: One of those texture machines, the price tag at that time was</br> about $30,000. Right now, it's probably closer to $40,000 because we're</br> talking about 1996. And he followed through, I came up to Akron, when I got</br> up to Akron though, they had projects, there were projects everywhere,</br> Kentucky, Michigan. And the pay, the pay was awesome. And that is where it</br> really, within I think about the second month that I was up north, it just</br> completely changed.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But I hadn't seen my wife and children since I had taken off up</br> there. So, I told her to come up there and visit and I started discuss with</br> her. I go, &quot;Look these other jobs,” and I had already said I was going to</br> take them, but I didn't tell her that. I told her, she says, &quot;What if you</br> go to be traveling?&quot; I go, &quot;It's worth it to be traveling back and forth,</br> but I'm not going to be traveling back and forth. We're going to just take</br> the kids; we're going to move up here and we're going to be together&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so that's when I moved them to Indianapolis. We stationed in</br> Indianapolis although I did travel quite a bit. I was on the road quite a</br> bit because I had later ended up with jobs as far down as Orlando, Florida.</br> And I ended up in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to repair a bunch of</br> apartments which we had worked on before. But it was a pretty wild ride,</br> but we really were doing really well, and it was really amazing.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. So, in Texas, you couldn't get a license, could you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I had a license, I did.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So how did you get it?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, the thing is that I had, when I was 19 I had a brush with</br> the law and I took care of it, but then ICE came looking for me, they</br> didn't pick me up or arrest me, but since they came looking for me, they</br> left their card there. And so, I voluntarily went in, but I knew something</br> happened, so I grabbed my driver's license, my social security card and I</br> tucked it away. So, I go into the offices and immediately they put me on a</br> pretty high, outrageous bond and—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: When you were 19?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, 19 is when I got in trouble. They came back looking for me, I</br> was already what? I think I was 27, going on, 27, 28.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, I go to the immigration office in Dallas and I went in and</br> then there they told me I was under arrest and then they shipped me to</br> Lorado. And I go before a judge in Lorado, and I go to fight this. I'm</br> going to have to sit here two years or pay $50,000 bond. And I go, &quot;No,” so</br> I just told the judge. I had an attorney, we had hired an attorney, but the</br> attorney, I knew he was just wanting to. I probably could've, maybe it was</br> a mistake, we could've won. But I did not want to sit there for two years</br> at a young age, two years and then at the end, maybe nothing.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I didn't want to waste two years. So, they deported me, I asked</br> the judge to sign, and I signed and that same evening I was on the bus to</br> Lorado, caught a bus to Saltillo, , and then this was a day before</br> Thanksgiving, when I arrived in Mexico. And then I stayed there in Saltillo</br> up through December, through Christmas. Christmas my parents came to visit,</br> and my girlfriend had come to visit too, my girlfriend had come to visit</br> around Christmas and then they left.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They were all citizens?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. And then we had plans to get married and my girlfriend, she</br> was willing to come live here, give everything up in the states and live</br> here, even though she's a citizen. So, I said, &quot;Well if you really feel</br> strongly then come on.” So, she came to Mexico and when she arrived here in</br> Mexico, I went to pick her up at the border, she came on the bus right</br> across from Eagle Path. So, I met her there and then brought her back to my</br> family's house.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Then we get there and we're there—and then my parents had arrived</br> there too—and she goes, &quot;When are we heading back?&quot; because she thought we</br> were going to Saltillo, because I told her it's a big city, better</br> opportunities there. I go, &quot;Oh we're not going to Saltillo.” She goes,</br> &quot;Well where are we going?&quot; I go, &quot;You think I'm going to sit here and years</br> later we're going to be worried about our kids, where they're at, because</br> you know they're not going to stay put here. They're going to jump that</br> border.” And I go, &quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; &quot;Well I'm going to take</br> that risk right now, I'm going to jump it right now.” She goes, &quot;No you</br> can't.” I go, &quot;You watch me. Let's go, we're leaving tomorrow&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, we left, and we went to Acuña across from Del Rio (Texas)</br> and then, &quot;No, just wait for me across the bridge. I'll be right there.”</br> So, &quot;No, no no.” So, I got a taxicab straight across the bridge. But I had</br> already had my Texas driver's license and social security card brought to</br> me in case they questioned me, then I could say, &quot;US.” And that's all I</br> did, just told them I was a US citizen, they just…It wasn't like it is</br> right now. Right now, even a US citizen is going to have trouble getting</br> across the bridge [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But over twenty, 22-23 years.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: 23 years? And were you worried about getting deported those 23 years?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Right after my daughter was born, yes, every day, the thought</br> would cross my mind. I had many brushes with Immigration, as we're in the</br> construction business. Many times, job sites would get raided and the only</br> thing was just to keep cool and walk straight up to them. Don't walk away</br> from them, if I seen them walking this way, I walked towards them instead</br> of walking away from them. I walked towards them.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, they probably, you being the head guy, they didn't think of you</br> as much—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, but during the raids I don't think they had any idea of who</br> was the head guy or not.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Because a lot of the times, a lot of these raids, I was all</br> covered in drywall, compound, white compound all over me, almost like if</br> you got paint all over me. But I just wouldn't…I would just walk right up</br> to them. And there was another gentleman—this was amazing because he didn't</br> speak English. And there was three times these raids that Immigration come</br> up and you're talking about over 10-11 people just scatter. He would never</br> run; he would stay put. And one time he was up on a scaffold and</br> immigration officer, it was one vehicle pulls up front and just one</br> officer, I knew that everybody else were all around in the back because</br> there was a big old wall.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, he finally gets out and comes inside the house and he</br> walks right past me and that happened a couple times where they would just</br> walk right past me, didn't even acknowledge that I was even there, nothing.</br> I go, &quot;Is God making me invisible?&quot; [Chuckle]. It really felt like that</br> because this time he didn't even acknowledge me, just walked right past me.</br> He didn't see me. Anyhow, he walks up to this other person, he's on the</br> scaffold and he goes, &quot;[Spanish 00:27:11] papels hombre?” and from up there</br> he goes, &quot;Yeah.” And pulls out his wallet, left him alone. Walked away.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And it was three times with that one person. And then after that</br> last time that I was with him that happened, he goes, &quot;Look at that,</br> they're taking all these poor guys that don't want to go. I want to go</br> back, I want a free ride back. But they don't want to take me.” And I spoke</br> to a cousin of his, it’s probably been about three years ago, and I asked</br> him about him, and he says, &quot;To this day, he don't have his residency, he</br> never got his papers.” He's living in Atlanta now by the way, or he was</br> when I talked to his cousin. His cousin goes, &quot;He's in Atlanta, but to this</br> day he never got his papers and he's never been deported.” And I go, &quot;Some</br> people are lucky and some are not&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you built your company, your wife was a US citizen?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And your two children?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: U.S. citizens.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: U.S. citizens and you sort of had a really nice middle-class life,</br> right?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. Real nice life. And my children, they didn't know that I was</br> illegal until it happened. And we had…Well there was a reason why we didn't</br> want them knowing because children can tell others. And then also they just</br> wouldn't understand. When they were a little bit older, like my son in</br> junior high and my daughter barely starting high school, do you remember</br> when Lou Dobbs went off on his rant? On CNN, when he started all that. When</br> Lou Dobbs started ranting, it was like every day on TV, the other school</br> children were talking about illegal ladies and this and this. And one day I</br> got home and my wife, the kids were already in bed, and she told me, &quot;You</br> know what? Vanessa came up and asked me if any of our relatives were</br> illegal aliens.” And I told her, &quot;Probably about time we started explaining</br> some things to her.” She goes, &quot;No, with our relatives yes, but as far as</br> you, no. You can't&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: So, we didn't. And it was just, once they did find out, I really</br> don't know, I'm really not sure how they really feel. But it had to be—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They didn't find out until you actually—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And they're adults now? Or young adults?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. And my daughter, I know it had to move her because after my</br> daughter, this is her graduating from Indiana University with honors, very</br> decorated.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Beautiful.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Her major is paralegal studies. She's still studying, she wants a</br> law degree.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And she did her internship at the Marian County prosecutor’s</br> office. She graduated and upon graduation—well before she even</br> graduated—she had secured a job. She's got a job, she's got her first job,</br> right now she's a paralegal for immigration family law.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh wow. Wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: So, I guess it has something—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Sure.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: My son, just barely last week he went to get settled. He was going</br> to IUP [Indiana University of Pennsylvania] in Indianapolis, but he just</br> got the Disney scholarship and it's a full scholarship, so room, board</br> everything. And he just got settled last week in Orlando. So, he's going to</br> be there for a little while.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And what school does that go for?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I'm not exactly sure, some university there in Orlando. I haven't</br> had a lot of contact since…They were busy over there, when they were over</br> there, I was busy heading this way.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, what happened? What happened to bring you to detention and</br> deportation?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, this last issue had to do with labor. I was used to these</br> labor department investigations and this last few really started getting</br> more intense though. I kind of think that it took a stronger turn with the</br> Obama administration, to focus on these contracts and make sure that all</br> the criteria in these prevailing wage jobs were really fulfilled to the T.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, for the federal contractors?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. And I'm an illegal alien, but you can look me up in the</br> Michigan records. And I'm registered there as a preferred government</br> contractor. I did well over 200,000 units and for Amtrak, which is in a bad</br> area of Detroit, and around other parts of Detroit, Wayne town. But there,</br> Indiana and Ohio, Florida and Mississippi, Texas, I was a preferred</br> government contractor. And did they know I was illegal? Damn right they</br> did.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They did?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I know they did. There's no way that they couldn't have known. Did</br> they care? No. They just needed their job done.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: At the end, I think they still didn't care but I think the heat</br> got turned up and they started—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's all you can think of?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: That's all I can do. But I'm still grateful I did very well and my</br> family's not hurting. If I felt that they were hurting, I would risk it all</br> and head back. But, they're comfortable, they're doing well. And I think,</br> well I feel that I set a standard for them, to strive to be more, to strive</br> because they all had, including my wife, when we married she was kind of</br> shy and her self-esteem—not that she had low self-esteem—but she really</br> didn't believe that much in herself. But right now, she's shining, she's</br> doing really well, and she's holding it together for both kids at that age</br> to still be living with her, other than my son right now in college, that</br> he went, that's to say a lot for two parents. But for a single parent, you</br> gotta hand it to her.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And when were you detained? How long ago?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: It's been about a year and a half ago, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you fought it for a year and a half?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, no, no. No, no. I had gotten, I was in, it was about six</br> months and then I got shipped over to Matamoras and I was at my family's</br> house, my family has a house here on the border.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I see.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I mean it's a nice house. It's up in the mountains and I had a lot</br> of family members, including my wife go, &quot;Why are you leaving? Why are you</br> going to Mexico City? You don't need to.” I go, &quot;Well one I'm going, I want</br> to be involved in helping these people. I gotta go out and do something, I</br> know I can still do something, I need a job. I need a job, I need a real</br> job.” Raising goats and sheep is fine and it was common people and stuff,</br> but I'm a busy body and I need to do something.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And then I became aware of New Comienzos and when I seen that,</br> that's what I want to do. I want to go down there, I want to be involved in</br> that. I want to be involved in that because that's something that I know I</br> can help and contribute to. And at the same time, I can get me a job down</br> there and I'll stay put. I'll come back and visit every now and then, but</br> I'm a city person [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. So, did you fight the detention or no?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No. When my first, I was detained when I was 19—well no, I got in</br> trouble when I was 19, detained at 27. That time, I signed away, I didn't</br> fight it. So, this time, I had no rights. I could not fight anymore because</br> I'd already signed away. This time around, I probably would've fought it,</br> because I had the money this time. Even if I knew I was going to lose, at</br> least I knew I had the money for the bond and I could put it off two,</br> three, four years. But, the first time I didn't have the money. So, I said,</br> “Sit here two years and wait and then probably get deported? No.”</br> Unfortunately, this time, I just, there was no rights that I could—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And have your kids or your wife been to visit you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes, they have up there. Hopefully once I get settled here. My</br> wife was supposed to come here in May, like around my birthday, which was</br> the week before last. But when my son got this scholarship, well he said,</br> &quot;We gotta go,” so her and my daughter both drove him down to Orlando and</br> they went to Disney, like we used to always go to Disney World. We would go</br> at least twice a year. There was one year that I had two projects that ran</br> over a year down there and I bought them season passes, because it was</br> easier for them to fly down on the weekend and come see me. And when they</br> come down, if you buy three individual park tickets, it's more expensive</br> then the season pass.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But they're still keeping up the traditions [Laughs]. They're</br> still going to Disney.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you spent a lot of time volunteering while you were in the</br> states.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, it seems like, does that make it a good fit to try it here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh yes. Yes, it's voluntary here, it's a different theme here.</br> It's a stronger, I feel it's a stronger theme. Not that my volunteer work</br> back over there wasn't, but my volunteer… Like helping out at the school</br> whenever I was in town, I would let them know that I would be in town and I</br> was available to substitute if one of the teachers needed a break or was</br> going to be missing. And I was qualified to take the classes on.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But I also was a volunteer English teacher when they started, they</br> started a Spanish church. When that Spanish church started, it was actually</br> my father that was the preacher. My father was at another church, but when</br> they wanted to do that, I talked to my father to see if he would, because</br> they asked me to, but I was honest, I go, &quot;You know I'm not that</br> knowledgeable of the Bible, to be able to. I don't want to stumble over</br> myself.” And you know when people are barely getting into a church and you</br> say one thing but then you contradict yourself, you're going to destroy</br> their faith.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Don't want to do that.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No. And I did a lot of volunteer work there at the church and the</br> school. It was great. And they've been right by my family's side, they're</br> still going to church there and anytime that they need anything, they're</br> right there. But good thing …. they've been fine. My wife, she's got a</br> pretty good job. She worked for a mortgage company, so she does pretty</br> well. And my daughter helps out too now that she's making money. It's been</br> a long ride. [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, we hear a lot of stories about young men who come over as babies</br> or toddlers and then for some reason get caught up in gangs or crime. What</br> was different for you? Why do you think that never happened?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, I can tell you that I think, probably the single most</br> important thing, the most important thing in a person's life is</br> environment. Parenting is important, but you can have the best parents in</br> the world, but if you have them in a bad environment, your parenting is not</br> going to supersede the environment. And that's one of the things that I</br> focus with my wife is that—well my parents, they provided a good</br> environment. And when I got married from my life experiences, I stepped</br> that up a bit. I told a lot of other relatives, this is one thing I've told</br> a lot of other relatives, this happens a lot in America—not just with</br> Mexicans or Central Americans, Blacks or whatever—is a lot of people yell</br> out racism or discrimination.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And I sincerely believe that sometimes we discriminate ourselves,</br> that we put it on ourselves, because we teach that to our children, because</br> weekends we all want to go get together with other relatives, other friends</br> of our own ethnicity. And that's not really what America's about and that's</br> not what I taught my children because that's not how I lived my life. I was</br> out with everybody, congregating with everybody, and that's the environment</br> that we brought our children up in. We brought them up in their church—I</br> was talking to you earlier, our church and the school that they went to was</br> part of the church. We were the only Hispanics.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But that doesn't mean that we didn't allow them or try to get them</br> to forget who they were. We didn't, because we brought them around our</br> relatives, but we let them see that environment and so that they felt</br> comfortable. So, when they got out into the world, they're comfortable</br> around anybody and they're not looking at colors or whatever. And they</br> don't feel like they're different and they don't feel different. I</br> honestly, I think I felt more different when I got back here [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Because it was really kind of weird. But over there I didn't, but</br> I think environment is one of the most important things. If you put a good</br> person in a bad situation, in a bad environment, sooner or later he'll</br> break. If you get a bad person that's never known what life is really</br> supposed to be about, guide him a little bit and give him a little time,</br> and if he's willing—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: It might work out.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah, it might work out.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Interesting. So, you achieved your dreams in America.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Do you have dreams now for yourself here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. My dream here is, one, to help here and I can't say it's a</br> goal that's going to be met. And the other is I'm going to have here what I</br> had over there and I'm confident that I can make that happen.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And will you make it through construction business, or will you make</br> it through…?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Right now, I think that there's other areas here that I could</br> probably succeed in without jumping into the construction business. We have</br> land back here (in the family home) and a buy little bit of cattle, make</br> some money here. There’s just several different ideas. But I know that I</br> can excel in a job here, because there's several people here that are</br> making some pretty high incomes and just, some pretty much as</br> telemarketers, but just there's some call centers with some good bonuses.</br> You're not going to get rich there, but you can make a good living.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But there's some opportunities right now.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: What do you think the Mexican government should be doing to better</br> integrate return migrants?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, I think that there should be a program where returning</br> migrant…Well, one, there should be at least some type of assistance, get</br> them a bus ticket and some type of cash, to get him back to his place of</br> origin. Job opportunities, some type of government incentive for employers</br> to hire new arrivals.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Some type of, I want to say grants, there should be some type of</br> assistance to help, some type of temporary housing assistance, maybe in</br> monetary assistance or vouchers, something. Not just dumping. One of the</br> things that's causing a lot of crime right along the border is you take</br> 1,000 people a day and dump them, right there on the border and they don't</br> have no food, they don't have nothing. And these gangs come along, they</br> have an endless army supply, they can supply their armies and never run out</br> of people as long as they're dumping people right there. Because you're</br> dumping people there with no money, no food, nowhere to go. There's</br> shelters, but them shelters are full.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Them shelters can't possibly hold all them people, they can't. And</br> so, all these people running around—they're running around the monument</br> right now—laying there around. I see them laying around, the same people</br> laying on the streets. But here in Mexico City, it's not that bad. You go</br> to the border and the border cities where all along the Texas border, those</br> are main dumping grounds for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. All</br> these border detentions that are on the border states, they're daily buses</br> are driving and dumping people off. Detentions from up north, they wait</br> until they fill up a plane, or planes, then they ship them. But here, they</br> catch. It's every day they're dumping people. And there’s gotta be</br> something done about that. I think that there's assistance for just about</br> any and everything else. I do think that it would be in the best interest</br> of the government to assist deportees that are coming back. It would</br> probably save them a lot of money—it'd probably save them more to get them</br> home and give them a little bit of cash, give them a bus ticket home to</br> where they're from, and it would be a lot less expensive than all the chaos</br> that's going on right now.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Seems that the US also has really ignored the whole problem, the</br> families that they're breaking up.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You've thought about that, in terms of US policy, ways that they can</br> eliminate the hardship that your family is going through because you're</br> here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I mean not just the financial, emotional but everything. And it seems</br> like it’s not even in the equation.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes, that's true, that's not even in the equation. [Pause]. That's</br> tough. But yes, I think [Pause] that [Pause] they're not looking at</br> individual cases when looking at this immigration issue. I mean if they</br> really, if the immigration person were really doing their job, then the</br> judge did his job and really take the time to look at each individual case,</br> some of these separations wouldn't happen. But they're not doing that, to</br> me they're just trying to pile up numbers. I know many a case where…Just an</br> example, one gentleman, taking care of his family, has residency, he's a</br> legal resident. One DWI and it's over with, he's gone.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: He's a legal resident?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: A legal resident. One DWI and that's it, he's gone. And I've known</br> of others that had up to three and they're still there. I know some that</br> have felonies and they're still there. Then one DWI, that's not being fair.</br> The biggest injustice I think is going after all these Dreamers and using</br> the information that they filled out on their DACA paperwork to go track</br> them down. I agree that there has to be some type of people should be</br> picked up, but they're not chasing those people. They're going for the easy</br> numbers because, you know what? Those guys they don't have paperwork where</br> they can go pick them up, they’re not going to school here, going there.</br> It's harder to catch them, so you know what? We can drum up 10-15,000</br> people right here, beef our numbers up. We got the addresses, let's just go</br> get them.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And that's kind of what they're doing, not really doing their job.</br> Just to say that “We're doing something.” With 9/11, I remember that they,</br> within the first few days, 20 something hundred arrests that they were</br> attributing as terrorist arrests. But you know who they were picking up?</br> They were picking up Mexicans most of them. It was not 20 something hundred</br> Middle Easterners. But regardless, they were numbers. They had to show that</br> they were doing something. But that's that [Chuckles].</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: The US, there's a lot that they could be doing, because they can</br> deport 100,000, but they know they gotta replace those 100,000 for the</br> workforce. One thing I know is I know the ins and outs of labor in the US.</br> That is one thing that I do know. And I do know that there's unwritten</br> policies that look the other way, look the other way while we get this</br> done. We need this done, look the other way. Hurricane Katrina was one, we</br> had immigration, immigration was about the only police patrolling the area</br> at the time and they weren't bothering anybody—it was hands off until they</br> get this cleaned up. And once all the toxic clean-up was out of the way,</br> then they started to enforce, but still not full force again.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: So, there's a lot to the government, part to blame there. Instead</br> of locking them up, they should really create some type of labor program.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: People can come and go.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: People can come, instead of coming across and, to me, instead of</br> somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could</br> pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the</br> US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do</br> that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private</br> business, they need to keep them costs down. It's like, would you like to</br> pay $30 for a Big Mac? [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You’re saying that McDonald's is just using a lot of undocumented and</br> paying them really?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well the whole concept of migrant labor, the migrant labor force,</br> is to keep the cost of products down and housing as well. If it wasn't for</br> migrant labor and this underground labor networks that are operating, a</br> $250,000 house would've probably cost you a million. And a lot of people</br> wouldn't be able to, a lot of people can't afford a $200,000 house</br> [Chuckles].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: No. Well I thank you very much.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Thank you all for coming, coming to help us out and spread the</br> news.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You’ve probably been asked this question, but do you consider</br> yourself an American? A Mexican?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: You know, honestly deep inside, American. That's how I've always</br> felt. But right now, after this happened, it's like have you ever, there</br> was a book called The Man with No Country, are you familiar with that?</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="eeefb39a-eb8b-4829-8240-8aeb553f6c5f" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Bureaucracy">Ben: That's, when I was deported, that's the first thing that, that's<br>
 what came to my mind, The Man with No Country, not here, not there, not<br>
 accepted here, not accepted over there. And when I got here it's like, no<br>
 paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a<br>
 driver's license, getting my voter registration—which is the main source of<br>
 ID here—the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.<br>
 And I was illegal in the United States and I was able to, anything I<br>
 needed, I could get over there. And here, I'm here, I had a hard time. It<br>
 took me a few months.<br>

 labor department investigations and this last few really started getting<br>
 more intense though. I kind of think that it took a stronger turn with the<br>
 Obama administration, to focus on these contracts and make sure that all<br>
 the criteria in these prevailing wage jobs were really fulfilled to the T.<br>

 area of Detroit, and around other parts of Detroit, Wayne town. But there,<br>

 and then, &quot;No, just wait for me across the bridge. I'll be right there.”<br>
 So, &quot;No, no no.” So, I got a taxicab straight across the bridge. But I had<br>
 already had my Texas driver's license and social security card brought to<br>
 me in case they questioned me, then I could say, &quot;US.” And that's all I<br>
 did, just told them I was a US citizen, they just…It wasn't like it is<br>
 right now. Right now, even a US citizen is going to have trouble getting<br>
 across the bridge [Laughs].<br>

 the law and I took care of it, but then ICE came looking for me, they<br>
 didn't pick me up or arrest me, but since they came looking for me, they<br>
 left their card there. And so, I voluntarily went in, but I knew something<br>
 happened, so I grabbed my driver's license, my social security card and I<br>
 tucked it away. So, I go into the offices and immediately they put me on a<br>
 pretty high, outrageous bond and—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: When you were 19?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: No, 19 is when I got in trouble. They came back looking for me, I<br>
 was already what? I think I was 27, going on, 27, 28.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Oh wow.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: And so, I go to the immigration office in Dallas and I went in and<br>
 then there they told me I was under arrest and then they shipped me to<br>
 Lorado. And I go before a judge in Lorado, and I go to fight this. I'm<br>
 going to have to sit here two years or pay $50,000 bond. And I go, &quot;No,” so<br>
 I just told the judge. I had an attorney, we had hired an attorney, but the<br>
 attorney, I knew he was just wanting to. I probably could've, maybe it was<br>
 a mistake, we could've won. But I did not want to sit there for two years<br>
 at a young age, two years and then at the end, maybe nothing.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: I didn't want to waste two years. So, they deported me, I asked<br>
 the judge to sign, and I signed and that same evening I was on the bus to<br>
 Lorado, caught a bus to Saltillo, , and then this was a day before<br>
 Thanksgiving, when I arrived in Mexico.</span><span id="c9dfee49-9266-4d0b-bff9-a9319b3aa9f1" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Higher Education, Attending, Opportunities from">Anne: And you then went to community college. The community college, the<br>
 courses that you took, were they designed to help you with your business?<br>
 Did you think about that?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Yes. The courses that I started taking were courses that I figured<br>
 would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For<br>
 instance, I took business management, small business management, was one of<br>
 the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--<br>
 definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance<br>
 because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real<br>
 estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor<br>
 in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,<br>
 but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in<br>
 Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the<br>
 opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that<br>
 much capital to be able to take that much more on.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Ben: Well, come these home equity loans, finance pulled money out of<br>
 the house, take the property, rent it out to somebody to pay that, or lines<br>
 of credit and then we'd do a job, I'd get the money, pay that loan off, and<br>
 free that line of credit up later on. But apart from that, I did take all<br>
 the basic arts classes, English, algebra, I had some calculus and<br>
 trigonometry. I taught those at our private school, where my kids went to,<br>
 later as a substitute.<br>

 they would let us watch TV. But my father also had a tape recorder and he<br>
 had some English cassettes. And, when dad was at work, my mother would have<br>
 my brother and I sit there, and to us at first it was like a game, to be<br>

 had already left to the United States. He was already working over there<br>
 when I was born. My brother was over, I had an older brother, but he left<br>
 to go work over there. Then, once I was born, he came back, gathered my<br>

I can't say that the</br> school was…Of course there were a few people, but I did okay. I didn't feel</br> out of place and I felt pretty well accepted by others.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And did your mom work too? Or just your dad?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: My mom, she worked quite a bit, but there was a period when my</br> youngest sister was born, she ceased from working and she stayed home with</br> her for a few years. And then once—I think my sister was about four years</br> old—then she went back and started working again until we were doing good</br> in the construction. When I jumped into the construction and started my own</br> business, then my dad went to work for me. And when he went to work for me,</br> then my mother didn't have to work any more. We were really doing pretty</br> well, we did pretty well. Did a lot of construction projects all throughout</br> the Midwest and eastern seaboard. Lot of government projects.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. A lot of low-income housing for the government.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you moved around, it wasn't a local company that just stayed—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I based my company in Indianapolis and the main reason that we</br> ended up based in Indianapolis is that I had a project going on in Akron,</br> Ohio, one in Indianapolis and then I had two coming up in the Kansas</br> City—in both-- Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas. And I knew it</br> was going to be a lot of jumping around, and I figured well Indianapolis</br> will be right in the center. So, I rented an apartment there for me and my</br> wife and my son and my daughter; my son was a baby, but my daughter, she</br> was like four years old, or three years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And then right about after that, we bought a house. Well, no, my</br> wife wanted to enroll my daughter in pre-K to get her going because her</br> age. Her date of birth and the cut off with the school, they won't let her</br> in for regular elementary school. So, she found this church and she told</br> me, &quot;There's this church that's got pre-K and we're going to get her</br> started there.” And I go, &quot;Well okay, go ahead.” So, we enrolled her there</br> and we ended up getting involved with that church and we were the only</br> Hispanics at the church at the time, whenever we did it. But they were good</br> to us and they still attend there.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: That church, they started building one year on, every year they</br> would add a year onto the school. And my daughter was one of the original</br> students. So, she's one of the original students. The first original</br> student to go all the way through the academy and graduate.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: What's it called?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Cornerstone Baptist Academy in Indianapolis.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you dropped out of high school to help with your dad because he</br> was sick and then you got your GED without studying.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you then went to community college. The community college, the</br> courses that you took, were they designed to help you with your business?</br> Did you think about that?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. The courses that I started taking were courses that I figured</br> would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For</br> instance, I took business management, small business management, was one of</br> the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--</br> definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance</br> because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real</br> estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor</br> in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,</br> but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in</br> Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the</br> opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that</br> much capital to be able to take that much more on.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, come these home equity loans, finance pulled money out of</br> the house, take the property, rent it out to somebody to pay that, or lines</br> of credit and then we'd do a job, I'd get the money, pay that loan off, and</br> free that line of credit up later on. But apart from that, I did take all</br> the basic arts classes, English, algebra, I had some calculus and</br> trigonometry. I taught those at our private school, where my kids went to,</br> later as a substitute.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you were in Texas initially, is that where you got married?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes, in Texas.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Your wife. When did the business start blossoming to help you move</br> out of Texas?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: The business started blossoming when we were in Texas. I had told</br> my wife to give me…Within five years we'll have a house and we'll both have</br> good vehicles, dependable vehicles, but it's going to take a while. Well</br> within a year and a half from when I started, we bought out first house and</br> we both had good, dependable vehicles. However, it was still tight when I</br> took a project on in Akron, Ohio. And when I took that project on, I did</br> not want to go up there for many reasons. One, because I had this</br> immigration issue on me and I'm going near the Canadian border. Another, I</br> didn't really want to be away from my family.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But when these customers get persistent, &quot;What's it going to take?</br> What's it going to take?&quot; And I said, &quot;It's just out of the question. I</br> can't go up there, I got all these jobs going on. Plus, I got bad</br> equipment, my equipment’s old and if my equipment breaks down up there, I'm</br> not going to be able to meet the schedules and we're all going to be in</br> trouble.” &quot;Is that it? Really?&quot; The last price he had upped the price of</br> what the contract was to pay, and the pay was fine. I had other reasons why</br> I didn't want to go. Well when he says, &quot;I'll throw in a brand-new texture</br> machine on top of it, but I'll sign off on the paperwork after you complete</br> the project.” And I go, &quot;You'll do that?&quot; &quot;I'll do that and when have you</br> known me to not keep my word?&quot; And I go, &quot;Done deal.”</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: One of those texture machines, the price tag at that time was</br> about $30,000. Right now, it's probably closer to $40,000 because we're</br> talking about 1996. And he followed through, I came up to Akron, when I got</br> up to Akron though, they had projects, there were projects everywhere,</br> Kentucky, Michigan. And the pay, the pay was awesome. And that is where it</br> really, within I think about the second month that I was up north, it just</br> completely changed.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But I hadn't seen my wife and children since I had taken off up</br> there. So, I told her to come up there and visit and I started discuss with</br> her. I go, &quot;Look these other jobs,” and I had already said I was going to</br> take them, but I didn't tell her that. I told her, she says, &quot;What if you</br> go to be traveling?&quot; I go, &quot;It's worth it to be traveling back and forth,</br> but I'm not going to be traveling back and forth. We're going to just take</br> the kids; we're going to move up here and we're going to be together&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so that's when I moved them to Indianapolis. We stationed in</br> Indianapolis although I did travel quite a bit. I was on the road quite a</br> bit because I had later ended up with jobs as far down as Orlando, Florida.</br> And I ended up in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to repair a bunch of</br> apartments which we had worked on before. But it was a pretty wild ride,</br> but we really were doing really well, and it was really amazing.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. So, in Texas, you couldn't get a license, could you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I had a license, I did.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So how did you get it?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, the thing is that I had, when I was 19 I had a brush with</br> the law and I took care of it, but then ICE came looking for me, they</br> didn't pick me up or arrest me, but since they came looking for me, they</br> left their card there. And so, I voluntarily went in, but I knew something</br> happened, so I grabbed my driver's license, my social security card and I</br> tucked it away. So, I go into the offices and immediately they put me on a</br> pretty high, outrageous bond and—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: When you were 19?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, 19 is when I got in trouble. They came back looking for me, I</br> was already what? I think I was 27, going on, 27, 28.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, I go to the immigration office in Dallas and I went in and</br> then there they told me I was under arrest and then they shipped me to</br> Lorado. And I go before a judge in Lorado, and I go to fight this. I'm</br> going to have to sit here two years or pay $50,000 bond. And I go, &quot;No,” so</br> I just told the judge. I had an attorney, we had hired an attorney, but the</br> attorney, I knew he was just wanting to. I probably could've, maybe it was</br> a mistake, we could've won. But I did not want to sit there for two years</br> at a young age, two years and then at the end, maybe nothing.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I didn't want to waste two years. So, they deported me, I asked</br> the judge to sign, and I signed and that same evening I was on the bus to</br> Lorado, caught a bus to Saltillo, , and then this was a day before</br> Thanksgiving, when I arrived in Mexico. And then I stayed there in Saltillo</br> up through December, through Christmas. Christmas my parents came to visit,</br> and my girlfriend had come to visit too, my girlfriend had come to visit</br> around Christmas and then they left.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They were all citizens?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. And then we had plans to get married and my girlfriend, she</br> was willing to come live here, give everything up in the states and live</br> here, even though she's a citizen. So, I said, &quot;Well if you really feel</br> strongly then come on.” So, she came to Mexico and when she arrived here in</br> Mexico, I went to pick her up at the border, she came on the bus right</br> across from Eagle Path. So, I met her there and then brought her back to my</br> family's house.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Then we get there and we're there—and then my parents had arrived</br> there too—and she goes, &quot;When are we heading back?&quot; because she thought we</br> were going to Saltillo, because I told her it's a big city, better</br> opportunities there. I go, &quot;Oh we're not going to Saltillo.” She goes,</br> &quot;Well where are we going?&quot; I go, &quot;You think I'm going to sit here and years</br> later we're going to be worried about our kids, where they're at, because</br> you know they're not going to stay put here. They're going to jump that</br> border.” And I go, &quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; &quot;Well I'm going to take</br> that risk right now, I'm going to jump it right now.” She goes, &quot;No you</br> can't.” I go, &quot;You watch me. Let's go, we're leaving tomorrow&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, we left, and we went to Acuña across from Del Rio (Texas)</br> and then, &quot;No, just wait for me across the bridge. I'll be right there.”</br> So, &quot;No, no no.” So, I got a taxicab straight across the bridge. But I had</br> already had my Texas driver's license and social security card brought to</br> me in case they questioned me, then I could say, &quot;US.” And that's all I</br> did, just told them I was a US citizen, they just…It wasn't like it is</br> right now. Right now, even a US citizen is going to have trouble getting</br> across the bridge [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But over twenty, 22-23 years.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: 23 years? And were you worried about getting deported those 23 years?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Right after my daughter was born, yes, every day, the thought</br> would cross my mind. I had many brushes with Immigration, as we're in the</br> construction business. Many times, job sites would get raided and the only</br> thing was just to keep cool and walk straight up to them. Don't walk away</br> from them, if I seen them walking this way, I walked towards them instead</br> of walking away from them. I walked towards them.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, they probably, you being the head guy, they didn't think of you</br> as much—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, but during the raids I don't think they had any idea of who</br> was the head guy or not.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Because a lot of the times, a lot of these raids, I was all</br> covered in drywall, compound, white compound all over me, almost like if</br> you got paint all over me. But I just wouldn't…I would just walk right up</br> to them. And there was another gentleman—this was amazing because he didn't</br> speak English. And there was three times these raids that Immigration come</br> up and you're talking about over 10-11 people just scatter. He would never</br> run; he would stay put. And one time he was up on a scaffold and</br> immigration officer, it was one vehicle pulls up front and just one</br> officer, I knew that everybody else were all around in the back because</br> there was a big old wall.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And so, he finally gets out and comes inside the house and he</br> walks right past me and that happened a couple times where they would just</br> walk right past me, didn't even acknowledge that I was even there, nothing.</br> I go, &quot;Is God making me invisible?&quot; [Chuckle]. It really felt like that</br> because this time he didn't even acknowledge me, just walked right past me.</br> He didn't see me. Anyhow, he walks up to this other person, he's on the</br> scaffold and he goes, &quot;[Spanish 00:27:11] papels hombre?” and from up there</br> he goes, &quot;Yeah.” And pulls out his wallet, left him alone. Walked away.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And it was three times with that one person. And then after that</br> last time that I was with him that happened, he goes, &quot;Look at that,</br> they're taking all these poor guys that don't want to go. I want to go</br> back, I want a free ride back. But they don't want to take me.” And I spoke</br> to a cousin of his, it’s probably been about three years ago, and I asked</br> him about him, and he says, &quot;To this day, he don't have his residency, he</br> never got his papers.” He's living in Atlanta now by the way, or he was</br> when I talked to his cousin. His cousin goes, &quot;He's in Atlanta, but to this</br> day he never got his papers and he's never been deported.” And I go, &quot;Some</br> people are lucky and some are not&quot;.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, you built your company, your wife was a US citizen?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And your two children?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: U.S. citizens.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: U.S. citizens and you sort of had a really nice middle-class life,</br> right?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. Real nice life. And my children, they didn't know that I was</br> illegal until it happened. And we had…Well there was a reason why we didn't</br> want them knowing because children can tell others. And then also they just</br> wouldn't understand. When they were a little bit older, like my son in</br> junior high and my daughter barely starting high school, do you remember</br> when Lou Dobbs went off on his rant? On CNN, when he started all that. When</br> Lou Dobbs started ranting, it was like every day on TV, the other school</br> children were talking about illegal ladies and this and this. And one day I</br> got home and my wife, the kids were already in bed, and she told me, &quot;You</br> know what? Vanessa came up and asked me if any of our relatives were</br> illegal aliens.” And I told her, &quot;Probably about time we started explaining</br> some things to her.” She goes, &quot;No, with our relatives yes, but as far as</br> you, no. You can't&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: So, we didn't. And it was just, once they did find out, I really</br> don't know, I'm really not sure how they really feel. But it had to be—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They didn't find out until you actually—</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And they're adults now? Or young adults?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. And my daughter, I know it had to move her because after my</br> daughter, this is her graduating from Indiana University with honors, very</br> decorated.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Beautiful.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Her major is paralegal studies. She's still studying, she wants a</br> law degree.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And she did her internship at the Marian County prosecutor’s</br> office. She graduated and upon graduation—well before she even</br> graduated—she had secured a job. She's got a job, she's got her first job,</br> right now she's a paralegal for immigration family law.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh wow. Wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: So, I guess it has something—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Sure.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: My son, just barely last week he went to get settled. He was going</br> to IUP [Indiana University of Pennsylvania] in Indianapolis, but he just</br> got the Disney scholarship and it's a full scholarship, so room, board</br> everything. And he just got settled last week in Orlando. So, he's going to</br> be there for a little while.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And what school does that go for?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I'm not exactly sure, some university there in Orlando. I haven't</br> had a lot of contact since…They were busy over there, when they were over</br> there, I was busy heading this way.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, what happened? What happened to bring you to detention and</br> deportation?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, this last issue had to do with labor. I was used to these</br> labor department investigations and this last few really started getting</br> more intense though. I kind of think that it took a stronger turn with the</br> Obama administration, to focus on these contracts and make sure that all</br> the criteria in these prevailing wage jobs were really fulfilled to the T.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, for the federal contractors?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes. And I'm an illegal alien, but you can look me up in the</br> Michigan records. And I'm registered there as a preferred government</br> contractor. I did well over 200,000 units and for Amtrak, which is in a bad</br> area of Detroit, and around other parts of Detroit, Wayne town. But there,</br> Indiana and Ohio, Florida and Mississippi, Texas, I was a preferred</br> government contractor. And did they know I was illegal? Damn right they</br> did.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: They did?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I know they did. There's no way that they couldn't have known. Did</br> they care? No. They just needed their job done.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: At the end, I think they still didn't care but I think the heat</br> got turned up and they started—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's all you can think of?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: That's all I can do. But I'm still grateful I did very well and my</br> family's not hurting. If I felt that they were hurting, I would risk it all</br> and head back. But, they're comfortable, they're doing well. And I think,</br> well I feel that I set a standard for them, to strive to be more, to strive</br> because they all had, including my wife, when we married she was kind of</br> shy and her self-esteem—not that she had low self-esteem—but she really</br> didn't believe that much in herself. But right now, she's shining, she's</br> doing really well, and she's holding it together for both kids at that age</br> to still be living with her, other than my son right now in college, that</br> he went, that's to say a lot for two parents. But for a single parent, you</br> gotta hand it to her.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And when were you detained? How long ago?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: It's been about a year and a half ago, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you fought it for a year and a half?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No, no, no. No, no. I had gotten, I was in, it was about six</br> months and then I got shipped over to Matamoras and I was at my family's</br> house, my family has a house here on the border.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I see.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: I mean it's a nice house. It's up in the mountains and I had a lot</br> of family members, including my wife go, &quot;Why are you leaving? Why are you</br> going to Mexico City? You don't need to.” I go, &quot;Well one I'm going, I want</br> to be involved in helping these people. I gotta go out and do something, I</br> know I can still do something, I need a job. I need a job, I need a real</br> job.” Raising goats and sheep is fine and it was common people and stuff,</br> but I'm a busy body and I need to do something.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And then I became aware of New Comienzos and when I seen that,</br> that's what I want to do. I want to go down there, I want to be involved in</br> that. I want to be involved in that because that's something that I know I</br> can help and contribute to. And at the same time, I can get me a job down</br> there and I'll stay put. I'll come back and visit every now and then, but</br> I'm a city person [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. So, did you fight the detention or no?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No. When my first, I was detained when I was 19—well no, I got in</br> trouble when I was 19, detained at 27. That time, I signed away, I didn't</br> fight it. So, this time, I had no rights. I could not fight anymore because</br> I'd already signed away. This time around, I probably would've fought it,</br> because I had the money this time. Even if I knew I was going to lose, at</br> least I knew I had the money for the bond and I could put it off two,</br> three, four years. But, the first time I didn't have the money. So, I said,</br> “Sit here two years and wait and then probably get deported? No.”</br> Unfortunately, this time, I just, there was no rights that I could—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And have your kids or your wife been to visit you?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes, they have up there. Hopefully once I get settled here. My</br> wife was supposed to come here in May, like around my birthday, which was</br> the week before last. But when my son got this scholarship, well he said,</br> &quot;We gotta go,” so her and my daughter both drove him down to Orlando and</br> they went to Disney, like we used to always go to Disney World. We would go</br> at least twice a year. There was one year that I had two projects that ran</br> over a year down there and I bought them season passes, because it was</br> easier for them to fly down on the weekend and come see me. And when they</br> come down, if you buy three individual park tickets, it's more expensive</br> then the season pass.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But they're still keeping up the traditions [Laughs]. They're</br> still going to Disney.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you spent a lot of time volunteering while you were in the</br> states.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, it seems like, does that make it a good fit to try it here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh yes. Yes, it's voluntary here, it's a different theme here.</br> It's a stronger, I feel it's a stronger theme. Not that my volunteer work</br> back over there wasn't, but my volunteer… Like helping out at the school</br> whenever I was in town, I would let them know that I would be in town and I</br> was available to substitute if one of the teachers needed a break or was</br> going to be missing. And I was qualified to take the classes on.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But I also was a volunteer English teacher when they started, they</br> started a Spanish church. When that Spanish church started, it was actually</br> my father that was the preacher. My father was at another church, but when</br> they wanted to do that, I talked to my father to see if he would, because</br> they asked me to, but I was honest, I go, &quot;You know I'm not that</br> knowledgeable of the Bible, to be able to. I don't want to stumble over</br> myself.” And you know when people are barely getting into a church and you</br> say one thing but then you contradict yourself, you're going to destroy</br> their faith.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Don't want to do that.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: No. And I did a lot of volunteer work there at the church and the</br> school. It was great. And they've been right by my family's side, they're</br> still going to church there and anytime that they need anything, they're</br> right there. But good thing …. they've been fine. My wife, she's got a</br> pretty good job. She worked for a mortgage company, so she does pretty</br> well. And my daughter helps out too now that she's making money. It's been</br> a long ride. [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So, we hear a lot of stories about young men who come over as babies</br> or toddlers and then for some reason get caught up in gangs or crime. What</br> was different for you? Why do you think that never happened?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, I can tell you that I think, probably the single most</br> important thing, the most important thing in a person's life is</br> environment. Parenting is important, but you can have the best parents in</br> the world, but if you have them in a bad environment, your parenting is not</br> going to supersede the environment. And that's one of the things that I</br> focus with my wife is that—well my parents, they provided a good</br> environment. And when I got married from my life experiences, I stepped</br> that up a bit. I told a lot of other relatives, this is one thing I've told</br> a lot of other relatives, this happens a lot in America—not just with</br> Mexicans or Central Americans, Blacks or whatever—is a lot of people yell</br> out racism or discrimination.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And I sincerely believe that sometimes we discriminate ourselves,</br> that we put it on ourselves, because we teach that to our children, because</br> weekends we all want to go get together with other relatives, other friends</br> of our own ethnicity. And that's not really what America's about and that's</br> not what I taught my children because that's not how I lived my life. I was</br> out with everybody, congregating with everybody, and that's the environment</br> that we brought our children up in. We brought them up in their church—I</br> was talking to you earlier, our church and the school that they went to was</br> part of the church. We were the only Hispanics.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But that doesn't mean that we didn't allow them or try to get them</br> to forget who they were. We didn't, because we brought them around our</br> relatives, but we let them see that environment and so that they felt</br> comfortable. So, when they got out into the world, they're comfortable</br> around anybody and they're not looking at colors or whatever. And they</br> don't feel like they're different and they don't feel different. I</br> honestly, I think I felt more different when I got back here [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Because it was really kind of weird. But over there I didn't, but</br> I think environment is one of the most important things. If you put a good</br> person in a bad situation, in a bad environment, sooner or later he'll</br> break. If you get a bad person that's never known what life is really</br> supposed to be about, guide him a little bit and give him a little time,</br> and if he's willing—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: It might work out.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah, it might work out.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Interesting. So, you achieved your dreams in America.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Do you have dreams now for yourself here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. My dream here is, one, to help here and I can't say it's a</br> goal that's going to be met. And the other is I'm going to have here what I</br> had over there and I'm confident that I can make that happen.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And will you make it through construction business, or will you make</br> it through…?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Right now, I think that there's other areas here that I could</br> probably succeed in without jumping into the construction business. We have</br> land back here (in the family home) and a buy little bit of cattle, make</br> some money here. There’s just several different ideas. But I know that I</br> can excel in a job here, because there's several people here that are</br> making some pretty high incomes and just, some pretty much as</br> telemarketers, but just there's some call centers with some good bonuses.</br> You're not going to get rich there, but you can make a good living.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: But there's some opportunities right now.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: What do you think the Mexican government should be doing to better</br> integrate return migrants?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well, I think that there should be a program where returning</br> migrant…Well, one, there should be at least some type of assistance, get</br> them a bus ticket and some type of cash, to get him back to his place of</br> origin. Job opportunities, some type of government incentive for employers</br> to hire new arrivals.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Some type of, I want to say grants, there should be some type of</br> assistance to help, some type of temporary housing assistance, maybe in</br> monetary assistance or vouchers, something. Not just dumping. One of the</br> things that's causing a lot of crime right along the border is you take</br> 1,000 people a day and dump them, right there on the border and they don't</br> have no food, they don't have nothing. And these gangs come along, they</br> have an endless army supply, they can supply their armies and never run out</br> of people as long as they're dumping people right there. Because you're</br> dumping people there with no money, no food, nowhere to go. There's</br> shelters, but them shelters are full.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Them shelters can't possibly hold all them people, they can't. And</br> so, all these people running around—they're running around the monument</br> right now—laying there around. I see them laying around, the same people</br> laying on the streets. But here in Mexico City, it's not that bad. You go</br> to the border and the border cities where all along the Texas border, those</br> are main dumping grounds for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. All</br> these border detentions that are on the border states, they're daily buses</br> are driving and dumping people off. Detentions from up north, they wait</br> until they fill up a plane, or planes, then they ship them. But here, they</br> catch. It's every day they're dumping people. And there’s gotta be</br> something done about that. I think that there's assistance for just about</br> any and everything else. I do think that it would be in the best interest</br> of the government to assist deportees that are coming back. It would</br> probably save them a lot of money—it'd probably save them more to get them</br> home and give them a little bit of cash, give them a bus ticket home to</br> where they're from, and it would be a lot less expensive than all the chaos</br> that's going on right now.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Seems that the US also has really ignored the whole problem, the</br> families that they're breaking up.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You've thought about that, in terms of US policy, ways that they can</br> eliminate the hardship that your family is going through because you're</br> here?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I mean not just the financial, emotional but everything. And it seems</br> like it’s not even in the equation.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yes, that's true, that's not even in the equation. [Pause]. That's</br> tough. But yes, I think [Pause] that [Pause] they're not looking at</br> individual cases when looking at this immigration issue. I mean if they</br> really, if the immigration person were really doing their job, then the</br> judge did his job and really take the time to look at each individual case,</br> some of these separations wouldn't happen. But they're not doing that, to</br> me they're just trying to pile up numbers. I know many a case where…Just an</br> example, one gentleman, taking care of his family, has residency, he's a</br> legal resident. One DWI and it's over with, he's gone.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: He's a legal resident?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: A legal resident. One DWI and that's it, he's gone. And I've known</br> of others that had up to three and they're still there. I know some that</br> have felonies and they're still there. Then one DWI, that's not being fair.</br> The biggest injustice I think is going after all these Dreamers and using</br> the information that they filled out on their DACA paperwork to go track</br> them down. I agree that there has to be some type of people should be</br> picked up, but they're not chasing those people. They're going for the easy</br> numbers because, you know what? Those guys they don't have paperwork where</br> they can go pick them up, they’re not going to school here, going there.</br> It's harder to catch them, so you know what? We can drum up 10-15,000</br> people right here, beef our numbers up. We got the addresses, let's just go</br> get them.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: And that's kind of what they're doing, not really doing their job.</br> Just to say that “We're doing something.” With 9/11, I remember that they,</br> within the first few days, 20 something hundred arrests that they were</br> attributing as terrorist arrests. But you know who they were picking up?</br> They were picking up Mexicans most of them. It was not 20 something hundred</br> Middle Easterners. But regardless, they were numbers. They had to show that</br> they were doing something. But that's that [Chuckles].</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: The US, there's a lot that they could be doing, because they can</br> deport 100,000, but they know they gotta replace those 100,000 for the</br> workforce. One thing I know is I know the ins and outs of labor in the US.</br> That is one thing that I do know. And I do know that there's unwritten</br> policies that look the other way, look the other way while we get this</br> done. We need this done, look the other way. Hurricane Katrina was one, we</br> had immigration, immigration was about the only police patrolling the area</br> at the time and they weren't bothering anybody—it was hands off until they</br> get this cleaned up. And once all the toxic clean-up was out of the way,</br> then they started to enforce, but still not full force again.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: So, there's a lot to the government, part to blame there. Instead</br> of locking them up, they should really create some type of labor program.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: People can come and go.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: People can come, instead of coming across and, to me, instead of</br> somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could</br> pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the</br> US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do</br> that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private</br> business, they need to keep them costs down. It's like, would you like to</br> pay $30 for a Big Mac? [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You’re saying that McDonald's is just using a lot of undocumented and</br> paying them really?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Well the whole concept of migrant labor, the migrant labor force,</br> is to keep the cost of products down and housing as well. If it wasn't for</br> migrant labor and this underground labor networks that are operating, a</br> $250,000 house would've probably cost you a million. And a lot of people</br> wouldn't be able to, a lot of people can't afford a $200,000 house</br> [Chuckles].</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: No. Well I thank you very much.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Thank you all for coming, coming to help us out and spread the</br> news.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You’ve probably been asked this question, but do you consider</br> yourself an American? A Mexican?</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: You know, honestly deep inside, American. That's how I've always</br> felt. But right now, after this happened, it's like have you ever, there</br> was a book called The Man with No Country, are you familiar with that?</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: That's, when I was deported, that's the first thing that, that's</br> what came to my mind, The Man with No Country, not here, not there, not</br> accepted here, not accepted over there. And when I got here it's like, no</br> paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a</br> driver's license, getting my voter registration—which is the main source of</br> ID here—the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.</br> And I was illegal in the United States and I was able to, anything I</br> needed, I could get over there. And here, I'm here, I had a hard time. It</br> took me a few months.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: It's really too bad.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Yeah. Kind of rough. I don't know if it had been easier here, in</br> the big city, but over there it was pretty rough, hard getting around.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Well, I wish you the best of luck.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh, thank you—</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I think that you're, you think you're going to be fine, so I think</br> you're going to be fine. And you must be very proud of your family, they</br> seem really great.</br>      </br>      </br> Ben: Oh, I am, they're going, they're moving forward, that was the</br> purpose of heading that way.</br>      </div><\p>
