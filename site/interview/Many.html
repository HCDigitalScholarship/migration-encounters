   other kids with a different life, with a good life, with a very nice house,<br>
   nice car. I don't know, a girlfriend, things like that. I was thinking<br>
   about my life and I say, &quot;Man, I can't stay here in Mexico, I just want to<br>
   go there and see what happens.&quot; So that's why I take the bus and I didn't<br>
   think about anything, I just take a little bit of money and went to the<br>
   train station and I just go.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anne: This is Many by the way and we're talking, and he just explained why</br>   he decided to leave Mexico at the age of fifteen.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, I was fifteen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard leaving your family behind?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah. I wish I can take my mom, I wish I can take my brothers with</br>   me, but I think that I had to do this by myself first in order to help</br>   them. I had to go first to get money in order to bring them with me. It was</br>   harder because my sister, she was just like four years old. My brothers,</br>   was like seven and eight years old. So it was really hard to tell them bye.</br>   It was hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said you took a train across the border?</br> </br> </br>   Many: A train.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have false papers or was it just easy to get on a train and</br>   go across and no one seemed to...?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, back in 1995, it was kind of easy. It was easy to cross the</br>   border. What I do, I just jumped onto the train on this side of Mexico and</br>   I just wait for the train to cross the bridge and like four hours later, I</br>   was in Corpus Christi, Texas. So, everything was new for me. I didn't know</br>   what I had to do to go with my uncle, but I just find some people who speak</br>   Spanish and they helped me to call my uncle and just let him know that I</br>   was in Corpus Christi and he just go on and pick me up. That's what</br>   happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, he knew you were coming?</br> </br> </br>   Many: He didn't know. He just knew after I crossed the border because if I</br>   tell him before, he was going to get mad at me because I was just too</br>   young, because he was telling me to stay at school and everything. So</br>   that's why I never tell nobody about it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where did you end up living with him? Which part of Texas?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I used to live with him and his wife in San Antonio, Texas. My uncle,</br>   he just died like two years ago. I grew up with him when I was fifteen</br>   to... I lived with him, well like fifteen years. He just died like two</br>   years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he help you find work?</br> </br> </br>   Many: My uncle? Well, in the beginning, he just take me to school, but I</br>   quit. So, I used to tell my uncle that I want to work. So he helped me to</br>   find a job.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And the first job was?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I was a dishwasher because he's a cook. He works in a restaurant, so</br>   he just told me if I want to work, I have to work with him washing dishes</br>   in order that he can keep an eye on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Laughs]. For his sister? Was your mom his sister?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Him? That's my mom's brother.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said you got married pretty early?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, I met this girl at school. She was fifteen years old, I was</br>   sixteen. You know when you see somebody, and you have like a click or</br>   something on the first time? It was something like that. I was in love with</br>   this girl. So I started dating her and then after that, we got married. We</br>   got married with her mom’s permission because she can’t get married. So, we</br>   got married and then we went back to Mexico to get married here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She was a US citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, she was born in Texas.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then you had to go back to the States after the wedding?</br> </br> </br>   Many: After the wedding, she went back first and then I just told her that</br>   it was going to take me about two hours in order to go back with her</br>   because I have to cross the border. I think it was around eight o’clock</br>   when she crossed the border in the morning. So around twelve, I was with</br>   her, like twenty miles from the border in United States. I do the same</br>   thing, I went to the bridge for the train and I do the same thing. I get</br>   into the train. I was kind of crazy. Well, I was young and in love. I was</br>   young and in love, so that's why.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you think at that moment, that marrying a U.S citizen, you might</br>   start thinking about getting your own papers to be a citizen yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I never think about it. I was just in love. A lot of people tell me</br>   that I have the chance to get the papers to be legal. But I didn't want her</br>   to feel that I was using her to get the papers. That's why I never asked</br>   her about, go to the lawyer and become legal with immigration and</br>   everything. So we just started living like that. But after that, we just</br>   live it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she come to live with you with your uncle or did you go to a</br>   separate place?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, when I started working, I just saved a little bit of money to</br>   give me an apartment so I can take her, we can live together. So we just</br>   found our own place.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, soon after she got pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Many: She got pregnant when she was seventeen and I was eighteen, when our</br>   first daughter was born. She was seventeen and I was eighteen when we got</br>   the first baby.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you still a dishwasher?</br> </br> </br>   Many: By that time, I was working in landscaping. The first years, I was</br>   just doing anything—I was just helping my uncle washing dishes, I used to</br>   help one of my friend's mom because she used to work in a motel. So, on the</br>   weekends I used to go to do housekeeping service. Clean the rooms, clean</br>   the bathrooms, making beds and vacuum, and everything. And then, like two</br>   years later, I started working in a landscaping company.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you like that work?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I loved it. I love to create waterfalls. I used to do all that.</br>   Flower beds and everything. I used to work a lot with the rock. I used to</br>   build flower beds and ponds and plant a lot of trees and everything,</br>   fences.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you still in San Antonio at that point?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When did you move to Atlanta?</br> </br> </br>   Many: We moved to Atlanta in 2002, I think? Yeah, 2002. I have another</br>   uncle in Atlanta. He worked in landscaping. He was just barely working on</br>   his own. He got his own company, he just told me to go with him to work. So</br>   that's why is—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was that a good move?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, it was fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had children by then. Two or three?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I think by the time, we already had the three kids.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, it's a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you ever get in trouble with like gangs or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No. Actually, (where we lived) it's a nice small town where it's not</br>   too much violence there. It's not too many people. So, no, I never related</br>   with gangs and everything because I was too young when I got married, so I</br>   didn't have time. I knew people they were related with these kind of gangs</br>   and groups, but I just talk to them for a little bit and then that's it. I</br>   never get into a gang or something. I like tattoos. You can see. I love</br>   tattoos because I like to draw a lot. I like tattoo too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can do it yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, some of them. Yes ma'am.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You enjoyed your life in Atlanta with the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah. Everything was really nice. To live with my family, it was</br>   really nice because I never had the experience before with my real family,</br>   with my mom and my dad, with my brothers. So I tried to do my best in order</br>   to give them what I didn't have at that time, when I was young. So I was</br>   just trying to change the way I used to live. I was trying to give my kids</br>   another life. I was just kind of patient with my family. I tried to work</br>   every single day to provide my family with a good life. I tried to give</br>   them a good education. I tried to give them nice advice to my kids, teach</br>   them to be respectful with the rest of the people, especially with the</br>   brothers, with their mom and everybody. When I remember this, when I start</br>   talking about this, my mind just gets crazy, it starts going back. So yeah,</br>   it was pretty cool to live with them. I lived with them for almost ten</br>   years and then I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, the event that led to the imprisonment was sort of finding your</br>   wife with another man?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Our relation, it was fine. Me and my wife, we was having a good life</br>   together. But we started having problems and we started having issues. But</br>   I think we were too young when we got married. So that's why we never</br>   talked about the problems, we never tried to solve problems. If we had a</br>   problem, it was very easy just to go away and not talk about it. Now, I</br>   think what happened is because we never talk. We never have a coffee and</br>   start thinking about our problem, so we just act wild. We just took a wrong</br>   decision. That's what I was telling you in the beginning, we just took the</br>   wrong decisions.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, for me, when I was mad, I just went out to my friend's place and</br>   started drinking. It was the only way to get this stress out of my life.</br>   That's what I thought. What happened after too many problems, she started</br>   talking with different people. So they was telling her that we have to</br>   separate, we have to get a divorce and everything. So she started thinking</br>   about it. After that, she was asking for a divorce and everything. I tried</br>   to solve the problem talking with her, but on her mind, she was just</br>   thinking about getting a divorce. So she started dating some different</br>   people. She know a lot of people. I didn't know when that happened; she</br>   just started dating another guy.</br> </br> </br>   Many: One day, I went back home, and her cousin tell me, &quot;You know what? I</br>   don't want to tell you this, but your wife is with this guy in his house</br>   because we saw the car.” They saw the car at this guy's house. I got mad</br>   and got sad because I can't... That happened because I never have time to</br>   solve the problem. After that, I went to this guy's house and I pulled up</br>   my truck and started kicking the doors because I know she was in there</br>   because her car was on that place. So, I started kicking doors and</br>   everything. When I break into the house, I saw them, those guys on the bed.</br>   So it was kind of a shock for me to see something like that. I was thinking</br>   to just go away and not doing nothing, that happened in my mind, that</br>   person in my mind. But then when I see this guy is laughing in front of me,</br>   I don't know, it made me mad. It made me so mad. So I started hurting him.</br>   I started fighting with him. After that, she jumped on me too. She started</br>   hitting me too, and I was fighting with her and then with him at the same</br>   time.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Every time when she was pulling my hair or when she was slapping me,</br>   I was feeling like this relationship is just… I mean, it's over. It's done.</br>   We're never going to fix something like this. I can do nothing to fix this</br>   right now. By that point, I can't. What happened, I just leave them and I</br>   walk away. Like I was telling you, as soon as I closed the door, police was</br>   there just waiting for me outside. So I started talking with one of the</br>   police officer and we were just having a good conversation because I</br>   explained to them the situation. My wife, she was cheating on me. Well, the</br>   thing is the police officer can't help. They had to take me to jail because</br>   I committed crimes. I went to jail and when I went to jail—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: There was a trial or?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, there was a trial. I went to court three times.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she press charges?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She did not?</br> </br> </br>   Many: She did not.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did her boyfriend press charges?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No, they never pressed charges on me. I don't know why. If they want</br>   to get rid of me, it was the best time to do that. Just press charges on me</br>   and put me in jail for a long time so they can start living their life</br>   together, but no, they never pressed charges on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you get sentenced for about a year, did you say?</br> </br> </br>   Many: A year and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A year and a half?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the county jail?</br> </br> </br>   Many: In the county jail.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your wife come visit you ever or bring you the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No, she just disappeared. She just left with this guy to another</br>   place. They moved together, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: With the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Many: With the kids. After I went to jail, I finished my sentence and I</br>   went back. I went back to United States. By that time, her and her</br>   boyfriend, they was living together, so when she knew that I was in town,</br>   she left the kids at my mom's house. My three kids and her baby because by</br>   that time she already had another baby with this guy. So she left the four</br>   kids in my mom's house because she wanted me to take care of the kids.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: This was after you got out of jail?</br> </br> </br>   Many: After, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you hadn't been detained by ICE yet?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No. I got deported after that. She sent the kids to my mom's house.</br>   What she wanted was for me to take care of the kids. So I grabbed the kids,</br>   I got my own place and I take the kids to school and everything, cook for</br>   them every day, on the mornings I take my little baby to daycare and</br>   everything. For eight months I was doing that every day.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where was she?</br> </br> </br>   Many: With this guy. It was confusing. It's kind of hard to explain because</br>   it's been a long time. She left with this guy. So I was taking care of the</br>   kids and one day after eight months, she came back, and she take the kids</br>   with her. She take the kids and take them to Atlanta, Georgia just like</br>   that. And she was telling me that I can't do nothing about it because I</br>   have a record, because if I try to do something, she was going to call the</br>   police. She was going to call immigration to take me and take away some of</br>   my family. I wasn't scared, but I was kind of sad because I can't believe</br>   that this girl, she done that. I can't believe that she left the kids with</br>   me for eight months and then after eight months, she came to take them with</br>   her after everything I do for the kids by myself. I used to get early in</br>   the morning to take them to take a bath and everything, and then she just</br>   done that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you were living with your kids for a while, she took them away,</br>   and then how did ICE finally get you?</br> </br> </br>   Many: After she takes the kids, I was living by myself and I used to drink</br>   a lot. When she left me, I was drinking every day. And one day I went out</br>   and I went to my friend's house, and the cops pull over and I don't have a</br>   license, I don't have anything. They take me to jail. And I know I was</br>   doing wrong because I shouldn't drink and drive because this is a karma, I</br>   know that. So, take me to jail and then they just find out that I was</br>   barely, that I just got out of jail for... They sent me back to Mexico.</br>   They sent me back. In 2012, that's when they sent me back to the border.</br>   After that, I haven't seen my kids for ten years, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you in detention for very long?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they put you in a detention center at all or did they just send</br>   you right back?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, they put me on a detention center in San Antonio, Texas for one</br>   month and then after that... They was trying to give me some more time</br>   because I just got out of jail. But immigration just tell me, &quot;You're not</br>   going to do any more time. We're going to deport you for twenty years and</br>   you can’t come back because if you got caught on the border or something</br>   again, we're going to...&quot; They told me they were going to give me, I think</br>   three years or something on jail. And they do, I think they will do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, I'm just going a little bit back. You left alone at age fifteen,</br>   but then your family came to the U.S as well. Did you help them get to the</br>   U.S?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, I love my family and I was too lonely. Well, I feel lonely in</br>   Texas. I used to live with my uncle, but it's not the same. I miss my mom,</br>   and my dad, and my brothers. So I helped them to cross the border because</br>   we can live together again. So, we helped them because my uncle helped me</br>   too. So we helped them to take them back to San Antonio, that's where all</br>   my family right now it's in Texas.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they come visit you when you were in jail?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No, because by that time, they don't have any official IDs or</br>   something. So that's why they can't come and visit me. And my kids, they</br>   can't let my kids visit me because they need somebody to take them, like</br>   their mom. Her mom, she didn't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's been a very lonely time for you.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to live like that because my dream, when I</br>   crossed the border, was have a good life, try to change my life. But after</br>   that, I didn't regret it but I think would be better if I would stay in</br>   Mexico because, I don't know how I explain to you, the reason that I</br>   crossed the border, I was trying to change something in my life. Something</br>   that I don't have when I was here in Mexico, but when I went to San</br>   Antonio, what I found it was just... How you call it? How do you say? It</br>   was not what I want. I lost my family, I've lost a few years of my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To prison?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, a year and half. I lost everything pretty much. I lost</br>   everything. I lived there for almost fourteen, fifteen years, and I had to</br>   start all over again in Mexico. This is hard because when I left from here,</br>   I was fifteen. When I came back, I was thirty-one. So, everything was</br>   different for me—it was like you start a new life. It was the same thing</br>   when I went to United States when I was fifteen. So when I came here,</br>   everything was very difficult for me to get a job because I don't have any</br>   papers, I don't have any friends. I don't have family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your family had left?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, because all the family was in Texas. So, when I came here, I</br>   went to the place where we used to live because I know a few guys from</br>   my—let's call it from my neighborhood. So, I just know a few guys. They</br>   helped me a lot. It was difficult. It's still difficult to live here</br>   without a family because sometimes I saw a lot of people with, especially</br>   around here, guys with kids walking around the park and everything. I wish</br>   I can go back in time and take my kids to a park or somewhere. But I can't,</br>   I had to get used to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you say that you lost everything, which you did. But it was like,</br>   you almost made it. That you had this wife and three children, and a good</br>   job, and you got your parents, your sisters and brothers over. You were</br>   sort of having a good life and then it all crashed.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, the good thing about this is because my family on the end, my</br>   family, all of them, they have a good life right now because they live in</br>   the States. They've been there for almost eighteen years or fifteen years,</br>   I don't remember. The reason that I crossed the border is because I wanted</br>   to change their lives too. So it don't matter if I lost everything. The</br>   good thing is because my kids, they're fine. My mom, she's fine, all my</br>   family. So I can live here, I can make it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I can. I have to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You told me a little bit in the survey about coming back and</br>   adjusting to Mexico. And you said you became a taxi cab driver. So tell me</br>   a little bit about that and how that happened and the violence that you</br>   encountered.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, when I came here, when I went back, it was hard for me to find</br>   a job because I didn't have any papers, any ID or anything like that. So,</br>   the only thing that I can do was—I know how to drive—one of my friends</br>   offered me to work with him with a taxi and they gave me one. They gave me</br>   a car to work for them. It was the first job that I have in Mexico after</br>   getting deported. I started working in taxi and about three months after</br>   the deportation, I got an assault for these guys. Like I was telling you,</br>   they was two kids. They were like twenty years old, I think. I think they</br>   were using drugs or something like that. They were high.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, one of them, they had a gun and I hear one of them told this guy</br>   to shoot me, &quot;Shoot him, shoot him.&quot; And the other guy, I remember his face</br>   through the mirror. I remember him. I was watching him and he was looking</br>   at me. And he was pointing on the back of my head. So after that, I don't</br>   remember. I don't remember because they shot me. And they take me to like</br>   in a hill and they dumped me out of the car. They take the car, they take</br>   the money and they put me on the ground. The good thing is because</br>   everything when we got... Somebody get into the taxicab, we let somebody</br>   else know where we're going.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, somebody else heard that I was getting somewhere when they knew,</br>   that it take me too much time to go back to that place. So, they started</br>   looking for me. They started calling me, and there’s no answer. So, they</br>   start looking for me. When they found me, they thought that I was dead</br>   because I was just laying down the ground with this part on my head, it was</br>   just like... I don't know how to explain to you. So they thought that I was</br>   dead. So they start talking to me, and they take me to the hospital.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, after that, they leave me in the hospital, and the doctor told me</br>   that they have to do a surgery to take the skull, the little parts, they</br>   take it out of my head. So they did that, and I stayed at the hospital just</br>   three days. After that they sent me back home after three days. Then six</br>   months later, they tell me that I have to get a metal plate, titanium. They</br>   had to give me a titanium plate to cover my head because they took about</br>   this much of my skull. So, they scheduled surgery for me to put that metal</br>   plate and ten little bit of screws. So that's why I have two big scars on</br>   my head.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, who is taking care of you during this time?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, my friend, actually it was his mom, my friend's mom. He'd take</br>   me to his house so I can heal up. Yeah, because the doctors, they were</br>   telling him that I have to call one of my family members in order that I</br>   can live with them. But I told them that I don't have any family here in</br>   Mexico. So the only person that I know it's just my friend and his mom. So</br>   that's why they used to call them to pick me up and then they give me a</br>   chance to go to their house to stay there for, I think I was there for one</br>   month until I'm better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Could you work after that or did you wait till after the titanium was</br>   put in?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, I was working, but I had like a hole. It was—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you still taxicab driving?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, because I didn't have anything, no papers, nothing to work</br>   with. So it was the only job available by that time. It was the only time.</br>   When my mom knew about the surgery and everything, they were telling me</br>   that they want to come back to take care of me. But I used to tell them no</br>   because they already have a life in the States. So if they come back here,</br>   they're going to start all over again like me. So it was going to be very</br>   difficult for her too to start all over again. So, I told my mom, &quot;Just</br>   stay there. Don't worry about me. I'm going to be okay. I just got out of</br>   the hospital and the doctor told me that everything is okay.&quot; Because they</br>   was asking these... Well, there was questions about, if I hear good, if I</br>   can talk correctly, if I can move my hand, my face and everything. When I</br>   passed the test he say, &quot;Okay, well, you ready to go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you finally get papers that allowed you to work like at the</br>   call centers?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is that a hard process?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, it took me around six months to get all my papers together.</br>   Then after that, I was looking to work with the police but they told me</br>   that I can't because I have tattoos already. So, I couldn't work with them.</br>   One day, I was just on the subway and I found this girl, she was with the</br>   little papers and everything. And she told me that if I knew English or</br>   something and I told her, &quot;Well, a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I would say a lot of English.</br> </br> </br>   Many: She told me that if I can get a conversation with somebody, I told</br>   her, “I can, I do.” So she take me to the place where I did the application</br>   and everything. So, that's when I started working on the call center three</br>   years ago. Three and a half years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you enjoy it?</br> </br> </br>   Many: It's cool. It's cool because I met a lot of people from the States,</br>   they've been through almost the same situation like me. So, I feel</br>   comfortable talking with people, they know how I feel. And I know how they</br>   feel because, some of them, they have the same situation. Not exactly the</br>   same, but almost the same. They left behind all parents, kids, their lives.</br>   So I feel comfortable.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, what are your dreams now that you're back?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, my dream, I have just one. The only dream that I have is to see</br>   my kids one more time. That's it. That's all I want. I don't ask for more.</br>   I don't ask for anything. To be honest and to be real, I know that I'm not</br>   going to come back to United States. And I know that they're never going to</br>   come back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But they can.</br> </br> </br>   Many: They can, but they're still young. My older daughter, she's eighteen,</br>   and I hope one day. My second girl, she's fifteen, and the little boy, he's</br>   fourteen years old. I think one day they can come back here in Mexico to</br>   visit me. That's the only thing that I want. Now, I'm saving a little bit</br>   of money to, one day if they decide to come back, I'm going to pay their</br>   tickets so they can come visit. I'm not saving money for anything else, I'm</br>   getting ready for the day that they tell me, &quot;Hey, we're going to go visit</br>   you.&quot; I have the money ready to buy tickets and bring them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you tried to communicate with them?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, because they changed numbers. They changed the number lately. I</br>   tried to get in touch with them, but the thing is, this girl, she just</br>   don't want me to get in touch with my kids. I don't know why. I tried too</br>   many times to ask her if I can talk with them, but she didn't want to. She</br>   didn't want me to see my kids. So, I'm just waiting. I have to be patient.</br>   One day, I know one day, it's going to be the day where I can see them</br>   again without her permission because they—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Older?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, they are going to get older, and they're going to start asking,</br>   &quot;Where is my dad?&quot; And they're going to start asking, “Where is their dad?”</br>   I'm just waiting for this day. I'm just waiting.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you say you're going to make it here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you envision making it means for you?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="bf45c158-a5ab-4714-8d86-ccb07871b25d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Dreams, Mexico, Family reunification">Many: Well, after I see my kids, I'm going to try to get me a place where I<br>
   can take my kids every time when they want to come and visit. I know that I<br>
   have opportunities because I'm Mexican. Mexico, they give me an opportunity<br>
   to give me a house after, I think one year or two years, working with a<br>
   social security number. They gave me a chance to get a house. I have to pay<br>
   for the rest of my life, but I mean, it's good. If I can get a house, I<br>
   think it's a pretty good option for me to see my kids again.<br>

   Many: Well, living in the United States, it was very nice. It was amazing<br>
   because I have a lot of friends on United States, and the culture. I like<br>
   the way people live in the United States and everything. I have a lot of<br>

   There's something wrong in Mexico. There's something different. I don't<br>

   crossed the border, was have a good life, try to change my life. But after<br>
   that, I didn't regret it but I think would be better if I would stay in<br>
   Mexico because, I don't know how I explain to you, the reason that I<br>
   crossed the border, I was trying to change something in my life. Something<br>
   that I don't have when I was here in Mexico, but when I went to San<br>
   Antonio, what I found it was just... How you call it? How do you say? It<br>
   was not what I want. I lost my family, I've lost a few years of my life.<br>

   Texas. I used to live with my uncle, but it's not the same. I miss my mom,<br>
   and my dad, and my brothers. So I helped them to cross the border because<br>
   we can live together again. So, we helped them because my uncle helped me<br>
   too. So we helped them to take them back to San Antonio, that's where all<br>
   my family right now it's in Texas.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did they come visit you when you were in jail?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: No, because by that time, they don't have any official IDs or<br>
   something. So that's why they can't come and visit me. And my kids, they<br>
   can't let my kids visit me because they need somebody to take them, like<br>
   their mom. Her mom, she didn't want to.<br>

   and I went to my friend's house, and the cops pull over and I don't have a<br>
   license, I don't have anything. They take me to jail. And I know I was<br>
   doing wrong because I shouldn't drink and drive because this is a karma, I<br>
   know that. So, take me to jail and then they just find out that I was<br>
   barely, that I just got out of jail for... They sent me back to Mexico.<br>
   They sent me back. In 2012, that's when they sent me back to the border.<br>

   together, but no, they never pressed charges on me.<br>

   don't want to tell you this, but your wife is with this guy in his house<br>
   because we saw the car.” They saw the car at this guy's house. I got mad<br>
   and got sad because I can't... That happened because I never have time to<br>
   solve the problem. After that, I went to this guy's house and I pulled up<br>
   my truck and started kicking the doors because I know she was in there<br>
   because her car was on that place. So, I started kicking doors and<br>
   everything. When I break into the house, I saw them, those guys on the bed.<br>
   So it was kind of a shock for me to see something like that. I was thinking<br>
   to just go away and not doing nothing, that happened in my mind, that<br>
   person in my mind. But then when I see this guy is laughing in front of me,<br>
   I don't know, it made me mad. It made me so mad. So I started hurting him.<br>
   I started fighting with him. After that, she jumped on me too. She started<br>
   hitting me too, and I was fighting with her and then with him at the same<br>
   time.<br>

 <br>
   Many: Every time when she was pulling my hair or when she was slapping me,<br>
   I was feeling like this relationship is just… I mean, it's over. It's done.<br>
   We're never going to fix something like this. I can do nothing to fix this<br>
   right now. By that point, I can't. What happened, I just leave them and I<br>
   walk away. Like I was telling you, as soon as I closed the door, police was<br>
   there just waiting for me outside. So I started talking with one of the<br>
   police officer and we were just having a good conversation because I<br>
   explained to them the situation. My wife, she was cheating on me. Well, the<br>
   thing is the police officer can't help. They had to take me to jail because<br>

   Many: Yeah. Everything was really nice. To live with my family, it was<br>
   really nice because I never had the experience before with my real family,<br>
   with my mom and my dad, with my brothers. So I tried to do my best in order<br>
   to give them what I didn't have at that time, when I was young. So I was<br>
   just trying to change the way I used to live. I was trying to give my kids<br>
   another life. I was just kind of patient with my family. I tried to work<br>
   every single day to provide my family with a good life. I tried to give<br>
   them a good education. I tried to give them nice advice to my kids, teach<br>
   them to be respectful with the rest of the people, especially with the<br>
   brothers, with their mom and everybody. When I remember this, when I start<br>
   talking about this, my mind just gets crazy, it starts going back. So yeah,<br>

   Many: No. Actually, (where we lived) it's a nice small town where it's not<br>
   too much violence there. It's not too many people. So, no, I never related<br>
   with gangs and everything because I was too young when I got married, so I<br>
   didn't have time. I knew people they were related with these kind of gangs<br>
   and groups, but I just talk to them for a little bit and then that's it. I<br>
   never get into a gang or something. I like tattoos. You can see. I love<br>

   this girl. So I started dating her and then after that, we got married. We<br>

   it was going to take me about two hours in order to go back with her<br>
   because I have to cross the border. I think it was around eight o’clock<br>
   when she crossed the border in the morning. So around twelve, I was with<br>
   her, like twenty miles from the border in United States. I do the same<br>
   thing, I went to the bridge for the train and I do the same thing. I get<br>
   into the train. I was kind of crazy. Well, I was young and in love. I was<br>

   was in Corpus Christi, Texas. So, everything was new for me. I didn't know<br>

   them. I had to go first to get money in order to bring them with me. It was<br>
   harder because my sister, she was just like four years old. My brothers,<br>

He just knew after I crossed the border because if I</br>   tell him before, he was going to get mad at me because I was just too</br>   young, because he was telling me to stay at school and everything. So</br>   that's why I never tell nobody about it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where did you end up living with him? Which part of Texas?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I used to live with him and his wife in San Antonio, Texas. My uncle,</br>   he just died like two years ago.

So, I used to tell my uncle that I want to work. So he helped me to</br>   find a job.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And the first job was?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I was a dishwasher because he's a cook. He works in a restaurant, so</br>   he just told me if I want to work, I have to work with him washing dishes</br>   in order that he can keep an eye on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Laughs].

I was just in love. A lot of people tell me</br>   that I have the chance to get the papers to be legal. But I didn't want her</br>   to feel that I was using her to get the papers. That's why I never asked</br>   her about, go to the lawyer and become legal with immigration and</br>   everything. So we just started living like that. But after that, we just</br>   live it that way.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she come to live with you with your uncle or did you go to a</br>   separate place?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, when I started working, I just saved a little bit of money to</br>   give me an apartment so I can take her, we can live together.

So that's why we never</br>   talked about the problems, we never tried to solve problems. If we had a</br>   problem, it was very easy just to go away and not talk about it. Now, I</br>   think what happened is because we never talk. We never have a coffee and</br>   start thinking about our problem, so we just act wild. We just took a wrong</br>   decision. That's what I was telling you in the beginning, we just took the</br>   wrong decisions.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, for me, when I was mad, I just went out to my friend's place and</br>   started drinking.

So they was telling her that we have to</br>   separate, we have to get a divorce and everything. So she started thinking</br>   about it. After that, she was asking for a divorce and everything. I tried</br>   to solve the problem talking with her, but on her mind, she was just</br>   thinking about getting a divorce. So she started dating some different</br>   people. She know a lot of people.

She started</br>   hitting me too, and I was fighting with her and then with him at the same</br>   time.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Every time when she was pulling my hair or when she was slapping me,</br>   I was feeling like this relationship is just… I mean, it's over. It's done.</br>   We're never going to fix something like this. I can do nothing to fix this</br>   right now. By that point, I can't. What happened, I just leave them and I</br>   walk away. Like I was telling you, as soon as I closed the door, police was</br>   there just waiting for me outside. So I started talking with one of the</br>   police officer and we were just having a good conversation because I</br>   explained to them the situation. My wife, she was cheating on me. Well, the</br>   thing is the police officer can't help. They had to take me to jail because</br>   I committed crimes. I went to jail and when I went to jail—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: There was a trial or?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, there was a trial. I went to court three times.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she press charges?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She did not?</br> </br> </br>   Many: She did not.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did her boyfriend press charges?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No, they never pressed charges on me. I don't know why. If they want</br>   to get rid of me, it was the best time to do that. Just press charges on me</br>   and put me in jail for a long time so they can start living their life</br>   together, but no, they never pressed charges on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you get sentenced for about a year, did you say?</br> </br> </br>   Many: A year and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A year and a half?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the county jail?</br> </br> </br>   Many: In the county jail.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your wife come visit you ever or bring you the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No, she just disappeared. She just left with this guy to another</br>   place. They moved together, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: With the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Many: With the kids. After I went to jail, I finished my sentence and I</br>   went back. I went back to United States. By that time, her and her</br>   boyfriend, they was living together, so when she knew that I was in town,</br>   she left the kids at my mom's house. My three kids and her baby because by</br>   that time she already had another baby with this guy. So she left the four</br>   kids in my mom's house because she wanted me to take care of the kids.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: This was after you got out of jail?</br> </br> </br>   Many: After, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you hadn't been detained by ICE yet?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No. I got deported after that. She sent the kids to my mom's house.</br>   What she wanted was for me to take care of the kids. So I grabbed the kids,</br>   I got my own place and I take the kids to school and everything, cook for</br>   them every day, on the mornings I take my little baby to daycare and</br>   everything. For eight months I was doing that every day.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where was she?</br> </br> </br>   Many: With this guy. It was confusing. It's kind of hard to explain because</br>   it's been a long time. She left with this guy. So I was taking care of the</br>   kids and one day after eight months, she came back, and she take the kids</br>   with her. She take the kids and take them to Atlanta, Georgia just like</br>   that. And she was telling me that I can't do nothing about it because I</br>   have a record, because if I try to do something, she was going to call the</br>   police. She was going to call immigration to take me and take away some of</br>   my family. I wasn't scared, but I was kind of sad because I can't believe</br>   that this girl, she done that. I can't believe that she left the kids with</br>   me for eight months and then after eight months, she came to take them with</br>   her after everything I do for the kids by myself. I used to get early in</br>   the morning to take them to take a bath and everything, and then she just</br>   done that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you were living with your kids for a while, she took them away,</br>   and then how did ICE finally get you?</br> </br> </br>   Many: After she takes the kids, I was living by myself and I used to drink</br>   a lot. When she left me, I was drinking every day. And one day I went out</br>   and I went to my friend's house, and the cops pull over and I don't have a</br>   license, I don't have anything. They take me to jail. And I know I was</br>   doing wrong because I shouldn't drink and drive because this is a karma, I</br>   know that. So, take me to jail and then they just find out that I was</br>   barely, that I just got out of jail for... They sent me back to Mexico.</br>   They sent me back. In 2012, that's when they sent me back to the border.</br>   After that, I haven't seen my kids for ten years, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you in detention for very long?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they put you in a detention center at all or did they just send</br>   you right back?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, they put me on a detention center in San Antonio, Texas for one</br>   month and then after that... They was trying to give me some more time</br>   because I just got out of jail. But immigration just tell me, &quot;You're not</br>   going to do any more time. We're going to deport you for twenty years and</br>   you can’t come back because if you got caught on the border or something</br>   again, we're going to...&quot; They told me they were going to give me, I think</br>   three years or something on jail. And they do, I think they will do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, I'm just going a little bit back. You left alone at age fifteen,</br>   but then your family came to the U.S as well. Did you help them get to the</br>   U.S?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, I love my family and I was too lonely. Well, I feel lonely in</br>   Texas. I used to live with my uncle, but it's not the same. I miss my mom,</br>   and my dad, and my brothers. So I helped them to cross the border because</br>   we can live together again. So, we helped them because my uncle helped me</br>   too. So we helped them to take them back to San Antonio, that's where all</br>   my family right now it's in Texas.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they come visit you when you were in jail?</br> </br> </br>   Many: No, because by that time, they don't have any official IDs or</br>   something. So that's why they can't come and visit me. And my kids, they</br>   can't let my kids visit me because they need somebody to take them, like</br>   their mom. Her mom, she didn't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's been a very lonely time for you.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to live like that because my dream, when I</br>   crossed the border, was have a good life, try to change my life. But after</br>   that, I didn't regret it but I think would be better if I would stay in</br>   Mexico because, I don't know how I explain to you, the reason that I</br>   crossed the border, I was trying to change something in my life. Something</br>   that I don't have when I was here in Mexico, but when I went to San</br>   Antonio, what I found it was just... How you call it? How do you say? It</br>   was not what I want. I lost my family, I've lost a few years of my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To prison?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, a year and half. I lost everything pretty much. I lost</br>   everything. I lived there for almost fourteen, fifteen years, and I had to</br>   start all over again in Mexico. This is hard because when I left from here,</br>   I was fifteen. When I came back, I was thirty-one. So, everything was</br>   different for me—it was like you start a new life. It was the same thing</br>   when I went to United States when I was fifteen. So when I came here,</br>   everything was very difficult for me to get a job because I don't have any</br>   papers, I don't have any friends. I don't have family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your family had left?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, because all the family was in Texas. So, when I came here, I</br>   went to the place where we used to live because I know a few guys from</br>   my—let's call it from my neighborhood. So, I just know a few guys. They</br>   helped me a lot. It was difficult. It's still difficult to live here</br>   without a family because sometimes I saw a lot of people with, especially</br>   around here, guys with kids walking around the park and everything. I wish</br>   I can go back in time and take my kids to a park or somewhere. But I can't,</br>   I had to get used to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you say that you lost everything, which you did. But it was like,</br>   you almost made it. That you had this wife and three children, and a good</br>   job, and you got your parents, your sisters and brothers over. You were</br>   sort of having a good life and then it all crashed.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, the good thing about this is because my family on the end, my</br>   family, all of them, they have a good life right now because they live in</br>   the States. They've been there for almost eighteen years or fifteen years,</br>   I don't remember. The reason that I crossed the border is because I wanted</br>   to change their lives too. So it don't matter if I lost everything. The</br>   good thing is because my kids, they're fine. My mom, she's fine, all my</br>   family. So I can live here, I can make it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can?</br> </br> </br>   Many: I can. I have to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You told me a little bit in the survey about coming back and</br>   adjusting to Mexico. And you said you became a taxi cab driver. So tell me</br>   a little bit about that and how that happened and the violence that you</br>   encountered.</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, when I came here, when I went back, it was hard for me to find</br>   a job because I didn't have any papers, any ID or anything like that. So,</br>   the only thing that I can do was—I know how to drive—one of my friends</br>   offered me to work with him with a taxi and they gave me one. They gave me</br>   a car to work for them. It was the first job that I have in Mexico after</br>   getting deported. I started working in taxi and about three months after</br>   the deportation, I got an assault for these guys. Like I was telling you,</br>   they was two kids. They were like twenty years old, I think. I think they</br>   were using drugs or something like that. They were high.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, one of them, they had a gun and I hear one of them told this guy</br>   to shoot me, &quot;Shoot him, shoot him.&quot; And the other guy, I remember his face</br>   through the mirror. I remember him. I was watching him and he was looking</br>   at me. And he was pointing on the back of my head. So after that, I don't</br>   remember. I don't remember because they shot me. And they take me to like</br>   in a hill and they dumped me out of the car. They take the car, they take</br>   the money and they put me on the ground. The good thing is because</br>   everything when we got... Somebody get into the taxicab, we let somebody</br>   else know where we're going.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, somebody else heard that I was getting somewhere when they knew,</br>   that it take me too much time to go back to that place. So, they started</br>   looking for me. They started calling me, and there’s no answer. So, they</br>   start looking for me. When they found me, they thought that I was dead</br>   because I was just laying down the ground with this part on my head, it was</br>   just like... I don't know how to explain to you. So they thought that I was</br>   dead. So they start talking to me, and they take me to the hospital.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, after that, they leave me in the hospital, and the doctor told me</br>   that they have to do a surgery to take the skull, the little parts, they</br>   take it out of my head. So they did that, and I stayed at the hospital just</br>   three days. After that they sent me back home after three days. Then six</br>   months later, they tell me that I have to get a metal plate, titanium. They</br>   had to give me a titanium plate to cover my head because they took about</br>   this much of my skull. So, they scheduled surgery for me to put that metal</br>   plate and ten little bit of screws. So that's why I have two big scars on</br>   my head.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, who is taking care of you during this time?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, my friend, actually it was his mom, my friend's mom. He'd take</br>   me to his house so I can heal up. Yeah, because the doctors, they were</br>   telling him that I have to call one of my family members in order that I</br>   can live with them. But I told them that I don't have any family here in</br>   Mexico. So the only person that I know it's just my friend and his mom. So</br>   that's why they used to call them to pick me up and then they give me a</br>   chance to go to their house to stay there for, I think I was there for one</br>   month until I'm better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Could you work after that or did you wait till after the titanium was</br>   put in?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, I was working, but I had like a hole. It was—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you still taxicab driving?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, because I didn't have anything, no papers, nothing to work</br>   with. So it was the only job available by that time. It was the only time.</br>   When my mom knew about the surgery and everything, they were telling me</br>   that they want to come back to take care of me. But I used to tell them no</br>   because they already have a life in the States. So if they come back here,</br>   they're going to start all over again like me. So it was going to be very</br>   difficult for her too to start all over again. So, I told my mom, &quot;Just</br>   stay there. Don't worry about me. I'm going to be okay. I just got out of</br>   the hospital and the doctor told me that everything is okay.&quot; Because they</br>   was asking these... Well, there was questions about, if I hear good, if I</br>   can talk correctly, if I can move my hand, my face and everything. When I</br>   passed the test he say, &quot;Okay, well, you ready to go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you finally get papers that allowed you to work like at the</br>   call centers?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is that a hard process?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, it took me around six months to get all my papers together.</br>   Then after that, I was looking to work with the police but they told me</br>   that I can't because I have tattoos already. So, I couldn't work with them.</br>   One day, I was just on the subway and I found this girl, she was with the</br>   little papers and everything. And she told me that if I knew English or</br>   something and I told her, &quot;Well, a little bit.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I would say a lot of English.</br> </br> </br>   Many: She told me that if I can get a conversation with somebody, I told</br>   her, “I can, I do.” So she take me to the place where I did the application</br>   and everything. So, that's when I started working on the call center three</br>   years ago. Three and a half years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you enjoy it?</br> </br> </br>   Many: It's cool. It's cool because I met a lot of people from the States,</br>   they've been through almost the same situation like me. So, I feel</br>   comfortable talking with people, they know how I feel. And I know how they</br>   feel because, some of them, they have the same situation. Not exactly the</br>   same, but almost the same. They left behind all parents, kids, their lives.</br>   So I feel comfortable.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, what are your dreams now that you're back?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, my dream, I have just one. The only dream that I have is to see</br>   my kids one more time. That's it. That's all I want. I don't ask for more.</br>   I don't ask for anything. To be honest and to be real, I know that I'm not</br>   going to come back to United States. And I know that they're never going to</br>   come back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But they can.</br> </br> </br>   Many: They can, but they're still young. My older daughter, she's eighteen,</br>   and I hope one day. My second girl, she's fifteen, and the little boy, he's</br>   fourteen years old. I think one day they can come back here in Mexico to</br>   visit me. That's the only thing that I want. Now, I'm saving a little bit</br>   of money to, one day if they decide to come back, I'm going to pay their</br>   tickets so they can come visit. I'm not saving money for anything else, I'm</br>   getting ready for the day that they tell me, &quot;Hey, we're going to go visit</br>   you.&quot; I have the money ready to buy tickets and bring them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you tried to communicate with them?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, because they changed numbers. They changed the number lately. I</br>   tried to get in touch with them, but the thing is, this girl, she just</br>   don't want me to get in touch with my kids. I don't know why. I tried too</br>   many times to ask her if I can talk with them, but she didn't want to. She</br>   didn't want me to see my kids. So, I'm just waiting. I have to be patient.</br>   One day, I know one day, it's going to be the day where I can see them</br>   again without her permission because they—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Older?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah, they are going to get older, and they're going to start asking,</br>   &quot;Where is my dad?&quot; And they're going to start asking, “Where is their dad?”</br>   I'm just waiting for this day. I'm just waiting.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you say you're going to make it here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you envision making it means for you?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, after I see my kids, I'm going to try to get me a place where I</br>   can take my kids every time when they want to come and visit. I know that I</br>   have opportunities because I'm Mexican. Mexico, they give me an opportunity</br>   to give me a house after, I think one year or two years, working with a</br>   social security number. They gave me a chance to get a house. I have to pay</br>   for the rest of my life, but I mean, it's good. If I can get a house, I</br>   think it's a pretty good option for me to see my kids again.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How do you think living in the US for sixteen years, how did it</br>   change you?</br> </br> </br>   Many: Well, living in the United States, it was very nice. It was amazing</br>   because I have a lot of friends on United States, and the culture. I like</br>   the way people live in the United States and everything. I have a lot of</br>   friends, white boys and black guys. I have a lot of friends and they was</br>   real, real nice friends. They helped me a lot when I have a bad situation.</br>   Remember when I told you that this girl left me with the kids?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So, I have a lot of friends. They was helping me out with kids. I</br>   have a good memories of living on the United States than here in Mexico</br>   because in Mexico, it's nice, it's beautiful in Mexico, but I don't know.</br>   There's something wrong in Mexico. There's something different. I don't</br>   know how I can explain to you, but it's something that I don't feel</br>   comfortable living here in Mexico because... I don't know if it's the</br>   government. Sometimes we don't have the same opportunities here being the</br>   Mexicans, living in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Many: The years that I lived in Texas, it was real nice. It changed me a</br>   lot and the way I think now. When I was there, America, they gave me a lot</br>   of chances, a lot of opportunities to be a better person, to be a better</br>   father, to be a better son and everything. But the thing, I was young, I</br>   was stupid and like I was telling you, I took the wrong decisions. Right</br>   now, I think about it and I wish I can get the same opportunity right now</br>   because I know now, I'm not going to do any mistake in the wrong way. I'm</br>   not going to do anything wrong, but it's too late now. So I had to start</br>   all over again here and do it here in Mexico. I had to do good things, be</br>   honest. To do what I have to do now.</br> </br> </br>   Many: I learned a lot from the experience that I have on the States. Good</br>   things, bad things, everything helped me out to grow up, to grow mentally.</br>   I didn't regret about anything because everything helped me. Good things</br>   and bad things helped me to think better now. So, I'm fine. Right now, I</br>   feel happy, I feel good. My mind is changing. The way I think now, it's</br>   different from back then.</br> </br> </br>   Many: So now, I just want to let my kids know that they have to think</br>   about, do something wrong because the consequences. After I took a wrong</br>   decision, it will change their lives. So like I was telling you, I am just</br>   waiting for the day to start talking to them about things like this. I</br>   don't want they being through the same situations like me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well thank you Many, so much, for telling me your story.</br> </div><\p>
