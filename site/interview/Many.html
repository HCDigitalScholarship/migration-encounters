   Many: I wanted to live the way I used to see on the TV. Like I used to see<br>
   other kids with a different life, with a good life, with a very nice house,<br>
   nice car. I don't know, a girlfriend, things like that. I was thinking<br>
   about my life and I say, "Man, I can't stay here in Mexico, I just want to<br>
   go there and see what happens." So that's why I take the bus and I didn't<br>
   think about anything, I just take a little bit of money and went to the<br>
   train station and I just go.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: This is Many by the way and we're talking, and he just explained why<br>
   he decided to leave Mexico at the age of fifteen.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, I was fifteen.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Was it hard leaving your family behind?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah. I wish I can take my mom, I wish I can take my brothers with<br>
   me, but I think that I had to do this by myself first in order to help<br>
   them. I had to go first to get money in order to bring them with me. It was<br>
   harder because my sister, she was just like four years old. My brothers,<br>
   was like seven and eight years old. So it was really hard to tell them bye.<br>
   It was hard.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You said you took a train across the border?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: A train.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you have false papers or was it just easy to get on a train and<br>
   go across and no one seemed to...?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, back in 1995, it was kind of easy. It was easy to cross the<br>
   border. What I do, I just jumped onto the train on this side of Mexico and<br>
   I just wait for the train to cross the bridge and like four hours later, I<br>
   was in Corpus Christi, Texas. So, everything was new for me. I didn't know<br>
   what I had to do to go with my uncle, but I just find some people who speak<br>
   Spanish and they helped me to call my uncle and just let him know that I<br>
   was in Corpus Christi and he just go on and pick me up. That's what<br>
   happened.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, he knew you were coming?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: He didn't know. He just knew after I crossed the border because if I<br>
   tell him before, he was going to get mad at me because I was just too<br>
   young, because he was telling me to stay at school and everything. So<br>
   that's why I never tell nobody about it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Where did you end up living with him? Which part of Texas?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: I used to live with him and his wife in San Antonio, Texas. My uncle,<br>
   he just died like two years ago. I grew up with him when I was fifteen<br>
   to... I lived with him, well like fifteen years. He just died like two<br>
   years ago.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did he help you find work?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: My uncle? Well, in the beginning, he just take me to school, but I<br>
   quit. So, I used to tell my uncle that I want to work. So he helped me to<br>
   find a job.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And the first job was?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: I was a dishwasher because he's a cook. He works in a restaurant, so<br>
   he just told me if I want to work, I have to work with him washing dishes<br>
   in order that he can keep an eye on me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: [Laughs]. For his sister? Was your mom his sister?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Him? That's my mom's brother.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So you said you got married pretty early?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, I met this girl at school. She was fifteen years old, I was<br>
   sixteen. You know when you see somebody, and you have like a click or<br>
   something on the first time? It was something like that. I was in love with<br>
   this girl. So I started dating her and then after that, we got married. We<br>
   got married with her mom’s permission because she can’t get married. So, we<br>
   got married and then we went back to Mexico to get married here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: She was a US citizen?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, she was born in Texas.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And then you had to go back to the States after the wedding?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: After the wedding, she went back first and then I just told her that<br>
   it was going to take me about two hours in order to go back with her<br>
   because I have to cross the border. I think it was around eight o’clock<br>
   when she crossed the border in the morning. So around twelve, I was with<br>
   her, like twenty miles from the border in United States. I do the same<br>
   thing, I went to the bridge for the train and I do the same thing. I get<br>
   into the train. I was kind of crazy. Well, I was young and in love. I was<br>
   young and in love, so that's why.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you think at that moment, that marrying a U.S citizen, you might<br>
   start thinking about getting your own papers to be a citizen yourself?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: I never think about it. I was just in love. A lot of people tell me<br>
   that I have the chance to get the papers to be legal. But I didn't want her<br>
   to feel that I was using her to get the papers. That's why I never asked<br>
   her about, go to the lawyer and become legal with immigration and<br>
   everything. So we just started living like that. But after that, we just<br>
   live it that way.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did she come to live with you with your uncle or did you go to a<br>
   separate place?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, when I started working, I just saved a little bit of money to<br>
   give me an apartment so I can take her, we can live together. So we just<br>
   found our own place.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, soon after she got pregnant?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: She got pregnant when she was seventeen and I was eighteen, when our<br>
   first daughter was born. She was seventeen and I was eighteen when we got<br>
   the first baby.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Were you still a dishwasher?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: By that time, I was working in landscaping. The first years, I was<br>
   just doing anything—I was just helping my uncle washing dishes, I used to<br>
   help one of my friend's mom because she used to work in a motel. So, on the<br>
   weekends I used to go to do housekeeping service. Clean the rooms, clean<br>
   the bathrooms, making beds and vacuum, and everything. And then, like two<br>
   years later, I started working in a landscaping company.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you like that work?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: I loved it. I love to create waterfalls. I used to do all that.<br>
   Flower beds and everything. I used to work a lot with the rock. I used to<br>
   build flower beds and ponds and plant a lot of trees and everything,<br>
   fences.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Were you still in San Antonio at that point?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: When did you move to Atlanta?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: We moved to Atlanta in 2002, I think? Yeah, 2002. I have another<br>
   uncle in Atlanta. He worked in landscaping. He was just barely working on<br>
   his own. He got his own company, he just told me to go with him to work. So<br>
   that's why is—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Was that a good move?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, it was fun.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And you had children by then. Two or three?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: I think by the time, we already had the three kids.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: It's a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, it's a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you ever get in trouble with like gangs or anything like that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: No. Actually, (where we lived) it's a nice small town where it's not<br>
   too much violence there. It's not too many people. So, no, I never related<br>
   with gangs and everything because I was too young when I got married, so I<br>
   didn't have time. I knew people they were related with these kind of gangs<br>
   and groups, but I just talk to them for a little bit and then that's it. I<br>
   never get into a gang or something. I like tattoos. You can see. I love<br>
   tattoos because I like to draw a lot. I like tattoo too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You can do it yourself?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, some of them. Yes ma'am.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You enjoyed your life in Atlanta with the kids?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah. Everything was really nice. To live with my family, it was<br>
   really nice because I never had the experience before with my real family,<br>
   with my mom and my dad, with my brothers. So I tried to do my best in order<br>
   to give them what I didn't have at that time, when I was young. So I was<br>
   just trying to change the way I used to live. I was trying to give my kids<br>
   another life. I was just kind of patient with my family. I tried to work<br>
   every single day to provide my family with a good life. I tried to give<br>
   them a good education. I tried to give them nice advice to my kids, teach<br>
   them to be respectful with the rest of the people, especially with the<br>
   brothers, with their mom and everybody. When I remember this, when I start<br>
   talking about this, my mind just gets crazy, it starts going back. So yeah,<br>
   it was pretty cool to live with them. I lived with them for almost ten<br>
   years and then I got deported.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, the event that led to the imprisonment was sort of finding your<br>
   wife with another man?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Our relation, it was fine. Me and my wife, we was having a good life<br>
   together. But we started having problems and we started having issues. But<br>
   I think we were too young when we got married. So that's why we never<br>
   talked about the problems, we never tried to solve problems. If we had a<br>
   problem, it was very easy just to go away and not talk about it. Now, I<br>
   think what happened is because we never talk. We never have a coffee and<br>
   start thinking about our problem, so we just act wild. We just took a wrong<br>
   decision. That's what I was telling you in the beginning, we just took the<br>
   wrong decisions.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: So, for me, when I was mad, I just went out to my friend's place and<br>
   started drinking. It was the only way to get this stress out of my life.<br>
   That's what I thought. What happened after too many problems, she started<br>
   talking with different people. So they was telling her that we have to<br>
   separate, we have to get a divorce and everything. So she started thinking<br>
   about it. After that, she was asking for a divorce and everything. I tried<br>
   to solve the problem talking with her, but on her mind, she was just<br>
   thinking about getting a divorce. So she started dating some different<br>
   people. She know a lot of people. I didn't know when that happened; she<br>
   just started dating another guy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: One day, I went back home, and her cousin tell me, "You know what? I<br>
   don't want to tell you this, but your wife is with this guy in his house<br>
   because we saw the car.” They saw the car at this guy's house. I got mad<br>
   and got sad because I can't... That happened because I never have time to<br>
   solve the problem. After that, I went to this guy's house and I pulled up<br>
   my truck and started kicking the doors because I know she was in there<br>
   because her car was on that place. So, I started kicking doors and<br>
   everything. When I break into the house, I saw them, those guys on the bed.<br>
   So it was kind of a shock for me to see something like that. I was thinking<br>
   to just go away and not doing nothing, that happened in my mind, that<br>
   person in my mind. But then when I see this guy is laughing in front of me,<br>
   I don't know, it made me mad. It made me so mad. So I started hurting him.<br>
   I started fighting with him. After that, she jumped on me too. She started<br>
   hitting me too, and I was fighting with her and then with him at the same<br>
   time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Every time when she was pulling my hair or when she was slapping me,<br>
   I was feeling like this relationship is just… I mean, it's over. It's done.<br>
   We're never going to fix something like this. I can do nothing to fix this<br>
   right now. By that point, I can't. What happened, I just leave them and I<br>
   walk away. Like I was telling you, as soon as I closed the door, police was<br>
   there just waiting for me outside. So I started talking with one of the<br>
   police officer and we were just having a good conversation because I<br>
   explained to them the situation. My wife, she was cheating on me. Well, the<br>
   thing is the police officer can't help. They had to take me to jail because<br>
   I committed crimes. I went to jail and when I went to jail—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: There was a trial or?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, there was a trial. I went to court three times.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did she press charges?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: No.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: She did not?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: She did not.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did her boyfriend press charges?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: No, they never pressed charges on me. I don't know why. If they want<br>
   to get rid of me, it was the best time to do that. Just press charges on me<br>
   and put me in jail for a long time so they can start living their life<br>
   together, but no, they never pressed charges on me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you get sentenced for about a year, did you say?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: A year and a half.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: A year and a half?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: In the county jail?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: In the county jail.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did your wife come visit you ever or bring you the kids?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: No, she just disappeared. She just left with this guy to another<br>
   place. They moved together, so.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: With the kids?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: With the kids. After I went to jail, I finished my sentence and I<br>
   went back. I went back to United States. By that time, her and her<br>
   boyfriend, they was living together, so when she knew that I was in town,<br>
   she left the kids at my mom's house. My three kids and her baby because by<br>
   that time she already had another baby with this guy. So she left the four<br>
   kids in my mom's house because she wanted me to take care of the kids.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: This was after you got out of jail?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: After, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And you hadn't been detained by ICE yet?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: No. I got deported after that. She sent the kids to my mom's house.<br>
   What she wanted was for me to take care of the kids. So I grabbed the kids,<br>
   I got my own place and I take the kids to school and everything, cook for<br>
   them every day, on the mornings I take my little baby to daycare and<br>
   everything. For eight months I was doing that every day.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Where was she?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: With this guy. It was confusing. It's kind of hard to explain because<br>
   it's been a long time. She left with this guy. So I was taking care of the<br>
   kids and one day after eight months, she came back, and she take the kids<br>
   with her. She take the kids and take them to Atlanta, Georgia just like<br>
   that. And she was telling me that I can't do nothing about it because I<br>
   have a record, because if I try to do something, she was going to call the<br>
   police. She was going to call immigration to take me and take away some of<br>
   my family. I wasn't scared, but I was kind of sad because I can't believe<br>
   that this girl, she done that. I can't believe that she left the kids with<br>
   me for eight months and then after eight months, she came to take them with<br>
   her after everything I do for the kids by myself. I used to get early in<br>
   the morning to take them to take a bath and everything, and then she just<br>
   done that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you were living with your kids for a while, she took them away,<br>
   and then how did ICE finally get you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: After she takes the kids, I was living by myself and I used to drink<br>
   a lot. When she left me, I was drinking every day. And one day I went out<br>
   and I went to my friend's house, and the cops pull over and I don't have a<br>
   license, I don't have anything. They take me to jail. And I know I was<br>
   doing wrong because I shouldn't drink and drive because this is a karma, I<br>
   know that. So, take me to jail and then they just find out that I was<br>
   barely, that I just got out of jail for... They sent me back to Mexico.<br>
   They sent me back. In 2012, that's when they sent me back to the border.<br>
   After that, I haven't seen my kids for ten years, I think.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Were you in detention for very long?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Huh?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did they put you in a detention center at all or did they just send<br>
   you right back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, they put me on a detention center in San Antonio, Texas for one<br>
   month and then after that... They was trying to give me some more time<br>
   because I just got out of jail. But immigration just tell me, "You're not<br>
   going to do any more time. We're going to deport you for twenty years and<br>
   you can’t come back because if you got caught on the border or something<br>
   again, we're going to..." They told me they were going to give me, I think<br>
   three years or something on jail. And they do, I think they will do it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, I'm just going a little bit back. You left alone at age fifteen,<br>
   but then your family came to the U.S as well. Did you help them get to the<br>
   U.S?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, I love my family and I was too lonely. Well, I feel lonely in<br>
   Texas. I used to live with my uncle, but it's not the same. I miss my mom,<br>
   and my dad, and my brothers. So I helped them to cross the border because<br>
   we can live together again. So, we helped them because my uncle helped me<br>
   too. So we helped them to take them back to San Antonio, that's where all<br>
   my family right now it's in Texas.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did they come visit you when you were in jail?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: No, because by that time, they don't have any official IDs or<br>
   something. So that's why they can't come and visit me. And my kids, they<br>
   can't let my kids visit me because they need somebody to take them, like<br>
   their mom. Her mom, she didn't want to.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: It's been a very lonely time for you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to live like that because my dream, when I<br>
   crossed the border, was have a good life, try to change my life. But after<br>
   that, I didn't regret it but I think would be better if I would stay in<br>
   Mexico because, I don't know how I explain to you, the reason that I<br>
   crossed the border, I was trying to change something in my life. Something<br>
   that I don't have when I was here in Mexico, but when I went to San<br>
   Antonio, what I found it was just... How you call it? How do you say? It<br>
   was not what I want. I lost my family, I've lost a few years of my life.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: To prison?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, a year and half. I lost everything pretty much. I lost<br>
   everything. I lived there for almost fourteen, fifteen years, and I had to<br>
   start all over again in Mexico. This is hard because when I left from here,<br>
   I was fifteen. When I came back, I was thirty-one. So, everything was<br>
   different for me—it was like you start a new life. It was the same thing<br>
   when I went to United States when I was fifteen. So when I came here,<br>
   everything was very difficult for me to get a job because I don't have any<br>
   papers, I don't have any friends. I don't have family.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Your family had left?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, because all the family was in Texas. So, when I came here, I<br>
   went to the place where we used to live because I know a few guys from<br>
   my—let's call it from my neighborhood. So, I just know a few guys. They<br>
   helped me a lot. It was difficult. It's still difficult to live here<br>
   without a family because sometimes I saw a lot of people with, especially<br>
   around here, guys with kids walking around the park and everything. I wish<br>
   I can go back in time and take my kids to a park or somewhere. But I can't,<br>
   I had to get used to it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you say that you lost everything, which you did. But it was like,<br>
   you almost made it. That you had this wife and three children, and a good<br>
   job, and you got your parents, your sisters and brothers over. You were<br>
   sort of having a good life and then it all crashed.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, the good thing about this is because my family on the end, my<br>
   family, all of them, they have a good life right now because they live in<br>
   the States. They've been there for almost eighteen years or fifteen years,<br>
   I don't remember. The reason that I crossed the border is because I wanted<br>
   to change their lives too. So it don't matter if I lost everything. The<br>
   good thing is because my kids, they're fine. My mom, she's fine, all my<br>
   family. So I can live here, I can make it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You can?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: I can. I have to.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You told me a little bit in the survey about coming back and<br>
   adjusting to Mexico. And you said you became a taxi cab driver. So tell me<br>
   a little bit about that and how that happened and the violence that you<br>
   encountered.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, when I came here, when I went back, it was hard for me to find<br>
   a job because I didn't have any papers, any ID or anything like that. So,<br>
   the only thing that I can do was—I know how to drive—one of my friends<br>
   offered me to work with him with a taxi and they gave me one. They gave me<br>
   a car to work for them. It was the first job that I have in Mexico after<br>
   getting deported. I started working in taxi and about three months after<br>
   the deportation, I got an assault for these guys. Like I was telling you,<br>
   they was two kids. They were like twenty years old, I think. I think they<br>
   were using drugs or something like that. They were high.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: So, one of them, they had a gun and I hear one of them told this guy<br>
   to shoot me, "Shoot him, shoot him." And the other guy, I remember his face<br>
   through the mirror. I remember him. I was watching him and he was looking<br>
   at me. And he was pointing on the back of my head. So after that, I don't<br>
   remember. I don't remember because they shot me. And they take me to like<br>
   in a hill and they dumped me out of the car. They take the car, they take<br>
   the money and they put me on the ground. The good thing is because<br>
   everything when we got... Somebody get into the taxicab, we let somebody<br>
   else know where we're going.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: So, somebody else heard that I was getting somewhere when they knew,<br>
   that it take me too much time to go back to that place. So, they started<br>
   looking for me. They started calling me, and there’s no answer. So, they<br>
   start looking for me. When they found me, they thought that I was dead<br>
   because I was just laying down the ground with this part on my head, it was<br>
   just like... I don't know how to explain to you. So they thought that I was<br>
   dead. So they start talking to me, and they take me to the hospital.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: So, after that, they leave me in the hospital, and the doctor told me<br>
   that they have to do a surgery to take the skull, the little parts, they<br>
   take it out of my head. So they did that, and I stayed at the hospital just<br>
   three days. After that they sent me back home after three days. Then six<br>
   months later, they tell me that I have to get a metal plate, titanium. They<br>
   had to give me a titanium plate to cover my head because they took about<br>
   this much of my skull. So, they scheduled surgery for me to put that metal<br>
   plate and ten little bit of screws. So that's why I have two big scars on<br>
   my head.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, who is taking care of you during this time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, my friend, actually it was his mom, my friend's mom. He'd take<br>
   me to his house so I can heal up. Yeah, because the doctors, they were<br>
   telling him that I have to call one of my family members in order that I<br>
   can live with them. But I told them that I don't have any family here in<br>
   Mexico. So the only person that I know it's just my friend and his mom. So<br>
   that's why they used to call them to pick me up and then they give me a<br>
   chance to go to their house to stay there for, I think I was there for one<br>
   month until I'm better.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Could you work after that or did you wait till after the titanium was<br>
   put in?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, I was working, but I had like a hole. It was—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Were you still taxicab driving?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, because I didn't have anything, no papers, nothing to work<br>
   with. So it was the only job available by that time. It was the only time.<br>
   When my mom knew about the surgery and everything, they were telling me<br>
   that they want to come back to take care of me. But I used to tell them no<br>
   because they already have a life in the States. So if they come back here,<br>
   they're going to start all over again like me. So it was going to be very<br>
   difficult for her too to start all over again. So, I told my mom, "Just<br>
   stay there. Don't worry about me. I'm going to be okay. I just got out of<br>
   the hospital and the doctor told me that everything is okay." Because they<br>
   was asking these... Well, there was questions about, if I hear good, if I<br>
   can talk correctly, if I can move my hand, my face and everything. When I<br>
   passed the test he say, "Okay, well, you ready to go."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, did you finally get papers that allowed you to work like at the<br>
   call centers?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Is that a hard process?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, it took me around six months to get all my papers together.<br>
   Then after that, I was looking to work with the police but they told me<br>
   that I can't because I have tattoos already. So, I couldn't work with them.<br>
   One day, I was just on the subway and I found this girl, she was with the<br>
   little papers and everything. And she told me that if I knew English or<br>
   something and I told her, "Well, a little bit."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I would say a lot of English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: She told me that if I can get a conversation with somebody, I told<br>
   her, “I can, I do.” So she take me to the place where I did the application<br>
   and everything. So, that's when I started working on the call center three<br>
   years ago. Three and a half years ago.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Do you enjoy it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: It's cool. It's cool because I met a lot of people from the States,<br>
   they've been through almost the same situation like me. So, I feel<br>
   comfortable talking with people, they know how I feel. And I know how they<br>
   feel because, some of them, they have the same situation. Not exactly the<br>
   same, but almost the same. They left behind all parents, kids, their lives.<br>
   So I feel comfortable.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, what are your dreams now that you're back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, my dream, I have just one. The only dream that I have is to see<br>
   my kids one more time. That's it. That's all I want. I don't ask for more.<br>
   I don't ask for anything. To be honest and to be real, I know that I'm not<br>
   going to come back to United States. And I know that they're never going to<br>
   come back to Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: But they can.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: They can, but they're still young. My older daughter, she's eighteen,<br>
   and I hope one day. My second girl, she's fifteen, and the little boy, he's<br>
   fourteen years old. I think one day they can come back here in Mexico to<br>
   visit me. That's the only thing that I want. Now, I'm saving a little bit<br>
   of money to, one day if they decide to come back, I'm going to pay their<br>
   tickets so they can come visit. I'm not saving money for anything else, I'm<br>
   getting ready for the day that they tell me, "Hey, we're going to go visit<br>
   you." I have the money ready to buy tickets and bring them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Have you tried to communicate with them?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, because they changed numbers. They changed the number lately. I<br>
   tried to get in touch with them, but the thing is, this girl, she just<br>
   don't want me to get in touch with my kids. I don't know why. I tried too<br>
   many times to ask her if I can talk with them, but she didn't want to. She<br>
   didn't want me to see my kids. So, I'm just waiting. I have to be patient.<br>
   One day, I know one day, it's going to be the day where I can see them<br>
   again without her permission because they—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Older?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah, they are going to get older, and they're going to start asking,<br>
   "Where is my dad?" And they're going to start asking, “Where is their dad?”<br>
   I'm just waiting for this day. I'm just waiting.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you say you're going to make it here in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: What do you envision making it means for you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, after I see my kids, I'm going to try to get me a place where I<br>
   can take my kids every time when they want to come and visit. I know that I<br>
   have opportunities because I'm Mexican. Mexico, they give me an opportunity<br>
   to give me a house after, I think one year or two years, working with a<br>
   social security number. They gave me a chance to get a house. I have to pay<br>
   for the rest of my life, but I mean, it's good. If I can get a house, I<br>
   think it's a pretty good option for me to see my kids again.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How do you think living in the US for sixteen years, how did it<br>
   change you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: Well, living in the United States, it was very nice. It was amazing<br>
   because I have a lot of friends on United States, and the culture. I like<br>
   the way people live in the United States and everything. I have a lot of<br>
   friends, white boys and black guys. I have a lot of friends and they was<br>
   real, real nice friends. They helped me a lot when I have a bad situation.<br>
   Remember when I told you that this girl left me with the kids?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: So, I have a lot of friends. They was helping me out with kids. I<br>
   have a good memories of living on the United States than here in Mexico<br>
   because in Mexico, it's nice, it's beautiful in Mexico, but I don't know.<br>
   There's something wrong in Mexico. There's something different. I don't<br>
   know how I can explain to you, but it's something that I don't feel<br>
   comfortable living here in Mexico because... I don't know if it's the<br>
   government. Sometimes we don't have the same opportunities here being the<br>
   Mexicans, living in Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: The years that I lived in Texas, it was real nice. It changed me a<br>
   lot and the way I think now. When I was there, America, they gave me a lot<br>
   of chances, a lot of opportunities to be a better person, to be a better<br>
   father, to be a better son and everything. But the thing, I was young, I<br>
   was stupid and like I was telling you, I took the wrong decisions. Right<br>
   now, I think about it and I wish I can get the same opportunity right now<br>
   because I know now, I'm not going to do any mistake in the wrong way. I'm<br>
   not going to do anything wrong, but it's too late now. So I had to start<br>
   all over again here and do it here in Mexico. I had to do good things, be<br>
   honest. To do what I have to do now.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: I learned a lot from the experience that I have on the States. Good<br>
   things, bad things, everything helped me out to grow up, to grow mentally.<br>
   I didn't regret about anything because everything helped me. Good things<br>
   and bad things helped me to think better now. So, I'm fine. Right now, I<br>
   feel happy, I feel good. My mind is changing. The way I think now, it's<br>
   different from back then.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Many: So now, I just want to let my kids know that they have to think<br>
   about, do something wrong because the consequences. After I took a wrong<br>
   decision, it will change their lives. So like I was telling you, I am just<br>
   waiting for the day to start talking to them about things like this. I<br>
   don't want they being through the same situations like me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Well thank you Many, so much, for telling me your story.<br>
