I was around five or six years. I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You were in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You grew up in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span> or somewhere else?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yes, here in—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why did you migrate?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: My mom used to have a lot of domestic violence problems with my</br>   dad. So normally, we would be leaving the house, and come back, and come</br>   and go. But one day, my uncle, who's an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizen, came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   for a vacation. It was in the meantime when we were out of the house. So my</br>   mom saw him. They talked about what was going on, how he can help, and one</br>   day, my mom said, &quot;You know what? We're leaving.&quot; So we grabbed a couple of</br>   clothes, shoes, and we left.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Just like that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. One day to another, we were already on the road. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. We were on the mobile home with my uncle and his family. We</br>   were setting off to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Ciudad Juárez</span>. So that's why basically.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: As a child, was it scary for you at home?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: It was kind of confusing because I was happy because they told me</br>   about Disneyland and all this stuff. I was really happy about that, but</br>   then you look back, and you're like, “My dad, my sisters, my house, my</br>   toys, my things, what's going to happen?&quot; I was happy during the day</br>   because I wouldn't think about it, but at nights, I used to have really bad</br>   dreams about it, about leaving my dad, about everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, it was just you who went with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: No. My <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> brothers and I.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, somebody stayed behind though? You say your sisters?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. Well, I got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> more sisters and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> more brothers. They're</br>   older. But they're not my mom's. They're my dad's, but we grew up together,</br>   so we're really...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I understand. I understand. So it was really hard to leave all of</br>   this behind.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yes. But as a kid, you don't think about it. You just, in your</br>   mind, you have it there. You know it's there. I know because, for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a whole   year</span>, I used to have really bad dreams where I used to wake up crying. My</br>   mom would be like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; I'm like, &quot;My dad, my dad, my dad.&quot;</br>   She's like, &quot;But it's already <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span>.&quot; I was like, &quot;I don't know. It just</br>   comes out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you remember some of the nightmares?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah, I remember one that it's like really stuck in my mind. It's</br>   really weird. The day we left the house—it's the same house where my dad</br>   lives right now, so it's on the avenue. I remember my mom, she had a truck,</br>   I don't know who give it to her, to take out our stuff. I remember I was</br>   sitting on the back looking like this and seeing my dad. Then I start</br>   crying. That's a dream I can't forget about. I don't know why, but it's</br>   there. [Chuckles]. It's just there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. Did you have contact with your dad when you were in the</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah, but not that much. At the beginning, it was really weird to</br>   talk to him because my mom didn't want him to know that we were over there,</br>   so it was once a month maybe? Then after that, we tried to contact him, but</br>   he was working or with his new family and this lady wouldn't let us talk to</br>   him. Every time I call, she would say, &quot;Ah, he's not here.” I could hear</br>   his voice on the back, so I was like, &quot;I know he's here.&quot; So she wouldn't</br>   let... so things like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: A lot of people have told us about domestic violence. Why do you</br>   think there's so much domestic violence?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Culture.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Tell me. What do you think? Say more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Well, here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, girls or women, we're raised to serve. We're</br>   not raised to think or do something on our own because it's dangerous for</br>   us. But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.</br>   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that</br>   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's</br>   basically it. And since we're raised by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> women. So, me as a woman, I</br>   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all</br>   girls here, they're not the same. They think, &quot;No, you're a girl, you need</br>   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.&quot; Then the daughter-in-law comes,</br>   and then she's like, &quot;No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for</br>   my son.&quot; So it's education basically, ignorance.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, do you think differently? I know I'm getting ahead of</br>   everything—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: No, it's okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: —but it's interesting. Do you think differently because you grew up</br>   in the States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird</br>   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.</br>   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if</br>   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll</br>   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really</br>   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,</br>   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,</br>   not because they're forcing me too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But you also talk about raising your son differently.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade, so he is about the age when</br>   I left. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Last week</span>, he came to me. He's like, &quot;Hey, mom. I need to tell you</br>   something, but you're going to get really mad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. Tell</br>   me.&quot; I thought he did something bad. He's like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; [Laughing].</br>   So, I was just like, &quot;Hold on. I was expecting something else.&quot; So he's</br>   like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get</br>   mad at it.&quot; &quot;Wait, mom. It gets worse.” I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;She's in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span></br>   grade.&quot; [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Okay. She's old for him,&quot; but inside</br>   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, &quot;Okay. I'm not going to tell</br>   him ‘No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's</br>   too big.’ No.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.</br>   What's the problem?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah. You like</br>   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.&quot;</br>   So, he looked at me and he's like, &quot;Can I write a letter for her?&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Go ahead.&quot; So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since</br>   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,</br>   respect her. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That's wonderful. That's a wonderful story.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So just on that, what's it like to have a son who's the same age as</br>   when you left? Does it bring you back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot</br>   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in</br>   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it</br>   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What would he be doing if he were in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.</br>   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. The</br>   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your</br>   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really</br>   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't</br>   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable</br>   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get</br>   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really</br>   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,</br>   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: He was born here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah, yeah. When I came back after, I think <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five, six years</span>, I had</br>   him.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, tell me about growing up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Growing up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span> was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the best   </span>years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was</br>   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family</br>   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that</br>   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she</br>   was a single mom with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> kids, she had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> jobs. We barely see her,</br>   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it</br>   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was</br>   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and</br>   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What kind of jobs did your mom have?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Factories. She used to work in factories in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">morning</span> and then at</br>   afternoon, and then during <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">the night</span>. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She</br>   used to sleep <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">around one hour</span> a day, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">one or two hours</span> a day, go work and</br>   come back. It was really hard for her.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but</br>   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived</br>   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a</br>   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't</br>   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I</br>   remember you—in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">the morning</span> until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">3:00 in the afternoon</span>, something like</br>   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].</br>   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give</br>   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You</br>   would see me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the whole week</span> there, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">an hour</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">two hours</span>, studying, studying,</br>   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I</br>   was really bad, to a B+ in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one month</span> because I was actually learning. I</br>   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all</br>   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would</br>   live there, I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You were an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> kid.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted</br>   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do</br>   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.</br>   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my</br>   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always</br>   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you</br>   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a</br>   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my</br>   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each</br>   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born</br>   on the same day.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the day</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">June 29</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Soon, you're having a birthday?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the same   day</span>, and we didn't know it. We were just like, &quot;Huh.&quot; But she used to take</br>   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   come here. I'll teach you something.&quot; So she would pull me a lot to</br>   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone—because my brothers</br>   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing—she would</br>   be like, &quot;Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,&quot; and I would</br>   go with her. She's a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Christian</span>, and they got a lot of activities on</br>   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over</br>   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,</br>   &quot;Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her</br>   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see</br>   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that</br>   you can't give her at the moment.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: So my mom said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and it was the best decision she ever made</br>   because my aunt, I was her daughter. I'm still her daughter. We call each</br>   other. We talk a lot. She saved my life because I was already starting to</br>   go with the girls. I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">sixth</span> grade when I moved in with my aunt. I</br>   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that</br>   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?</br>   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to</br>   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you</br>   had to do it. I remember <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span>. The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> fight I went to, I was standing in</br>   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just</br>   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was</br>   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down</br>   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or</br>   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight</br>   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody</br>   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Bit somebody?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. I was like, &quot;What? What are you doing?&quot; So it was really</br>   scary for me, and I didn't like it, but you have to do it because you want</br>   friends. If you don't do it, they're going to do it to you. That's when my</br>   aunt came in, and she's like, &quot;Come with.&quot; She saved that part of me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, did you find another group of friends?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Well, yeah, when I went to live with my aunt, it was a whole</br>   different story because I used to live in ___ <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. It's a really</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> town.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,</br>   California. It's a really nice little town and really <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. So, when I</br>   got there, I was like, &quot;Hey, I like it here.&quot; [Chuckles]. When I got to</br>   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able</br>   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used</br>   to have all types of friends, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Korean</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span>,</br>   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like</br>   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> from</br>   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: My aunt would be like, &quot;Why don't you go with the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> or just</br>   one group?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I can learn from everybody. You can learn from</br>   everything.&quot; I like how <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African Americans</span> talk, and how they act, and how</br>   happy they are. Then you also turn around and look at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>, and you</br>   see how nice and educated they are. They talk about music. They talk about</br>   really cool things. Then you go with my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Korean</span> friends, and they teach me</br>   how to draw. You can learn from their cultures and the way they were raised</br>   just by talking to them. That's amazing for me. That's why I used to like.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: So I was happy. Then my aunt would be like, &quot;Okay. If you can</br>   speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Korean</span> and understand it, it's your problem.&quot; [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Korean</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: No, I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying</br>   to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, so I was like, &quot;Okay, it's hard.&quot; [Laughs].</br>   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> really</br>   well, so we were like, &quot;Uh.&quot; We make hand signs so it was fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">My first year</span> of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom</br>   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your</br>   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she</br>   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my</br>   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking</br>   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So again—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: We start all over.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: All over again.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Around fifteen</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that</br>   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had</br>   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I</br>   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,</br>   hey, it's not my house.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: In what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Army.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span>. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: [Chuckle]. It has been since <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">day one</span>. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span> has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">summertime</span>, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, house are really big. And</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Oaxaqueña</span>.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I don't need to be like another person to come from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>.</br>   You need to understand that. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">Thousands</span> of people go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You didn't do it in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, but you did it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every single day</span>.</br>   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're</br>   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;</br>   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're</br>   leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I spent <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a week</span> at home. My mom was really mad at me because she</br>   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an</br>   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was</br>   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.</br>   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.</br>   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me</br>   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going</br>   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.</br>   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show</br>   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I</br>   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Was that here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and</br>   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems</br>   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent</br>   student in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span> and here, when I got here, I barely passed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the year</span>.</br>   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this</br>   back in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. This was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span>-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but</br>   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I</br>   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How many years ago was this? How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">twenty-six</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you came back when you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">fifteen</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">around eleven years</span>, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow. How come your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> is still so good?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: [Laughs]. I practice a lot. I used to work in call centers.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah, but still.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. [Laughs]. Then I talk to my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, my</br>   brother, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You talk to them in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. Yeah, we try to keep it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, so I can still practice.</br>   When I used to work, it was everything in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. So I try to practice a</br>   lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did anything get any better?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, &quot;Okay. If I'm</br>   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can</br>   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.</br>   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying</br>   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't</br>   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The</br>   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They</br>   wouldn't check on you like, &quot;It's your responsibility to come to school,</br>   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.&quot; Basically,</br>   what we used to do in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">mornings</span>, we had to be at school at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">5:00 AM</span></br>   because we used to cook in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">the morning</span>. Then around <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">7:00</span>—we had, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">7:00 to   </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">8:00</span>, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we</br>   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in</br>   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.</br>   So by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">12:00</span>, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would</br>   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get</br>   drunk again. Basically, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">that year</span>, I was really drunk the whole time. My</br>   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out</br>   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You</br>   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is</br>   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going</br>   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come</br>   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she</br>   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It</br>   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: It was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: But then, I met this guy who is my baby's dad. He was from the</br>   best kids there were because you could find worse. He would be like, &quot;No,</br>   go in your classes. Be good. You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;Hey, he's protecting me.&quot; I found somebody to protect me,</br>   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish</br>   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and</br>   I couldn't go to school no more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What sickness did you have?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I don't know what it's called in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. It's Trombocitopénica</br>   Púrpura-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Thrombosis—thrombosis of something, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. My blood is like water. Be like water. Then if you touch me</br>   like that, even if you go like that, you will see a big... I don't know how</br>   you say moretón. Bruise?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Bruise.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yeah. I will get a really big bruise even if you go like that. So</br>   I had to stay in bed for a really long time, and I got medicated. I</br>   couldn't go to school. I lost <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span>. Then I tried to go back, and then I</br>   got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay. This is not for me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How old were you when you got pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">Nineteen</span>. Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">nineteen</span>. Then I got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay.</br>   I'm just going to take care of my son, my family. I just want to have a</br>   family like my aunt's family in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.&quot; That's what I wanted. I started</br>   working on that. I was really happy at that moment. I was pregnant. I was</br>   going to have my kid. I had my husband. He loved me. Everything was</br>   perfect, but then, this president with his political things came with the</br>   reforma energetica.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah, the energy reform.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: And screw everything up for his family and for everything. So—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What do you mean? Why did the energy reform—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: This reform, whenever they change presidents, everything in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   is stopped for a really long time, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a year</span>. My boyfriend's family, at</br>   that time, used to sell... How do you say tubos?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: The tubes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Tubes for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Pemex</span>, the ones they use to transport everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Petrols, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: They used to sell those big tubes to them. So once the person</br>   came, they stopped everything. They were fine because they knew what's</br>   going to happen, but then he said, &quot;Reforma energetica.&quot; They stopped it</br>   for a really long time more. So they didn't have the money. They weren't</br>   working no more. They didn't have enough money to survive to that. So until</br>   the time right now, they haven't sell anything to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Pemex</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Pemex</span> is not</br>   buying nothing. That's already what? <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Six, seven years ago</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So which president are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Peña Nieto</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: So this guy comes in, screws everything up for everybody because</br>   we're not the only family. We know families that they were millionaires.</br>   And right now, they don't have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">a peso</span>. So problems come out on our side. We</br>   don't have money. We have to go live with his parents, and his mom is not</br>   the best person ever. She's a really <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> woman like, &quot;You have to do</br>   this, this, this.&quot; [Chuckles]. I'm like, &quot;I'm pregnant. How can I explain</br>   to you?&quot; Because I got pregnant again. After <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span>, I got pregnant. She</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, take that clothes upstairs to hang because I can't, my</br>   knees hurt.” And I was like, “I'm pregnant. I can't carry and go up <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span></br>   levels of stairs. I can't.&quot; So she would make me do it because I was living</br>   at her house. I had to clean, cook, do everything for everybody since I was</br>   living at their house, and she wouldn't do anything. Then on top of that,</br>   when I used to feel bad like headaches or something like that, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, no. Wake up. Get up. You need to do this.&quot; Like that. I don't</br>   know if I was weak, [Chuckle] if I'm a weak woman or not, or it was too</br>   much what I had to do in that stage, but I ended up losing my baby. I lost</br>   my kidney. I lost both of my kidneys.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I lost my kidneys and so I was sick. I've just been trying to</br>   survive. I don't know if I learned or I just decided not to do more than I</br>   have to, to survive because whenever you try to do the best you can, people</br>   don't think the same way as you. My baby's dad don't think the same way as</br>   me. I don't know if he doesn't want the family that I want or worse. We</br>   don't have the same culture. When I started working, he used to get really</br>   mad. He used to get really jealous. He would be like, &quot;Hey, no. Don't talk</br>   to this person. Don't talk to this person. No, you can't do that.&quot; Then I</br>   got ascended, ascent? Promotion.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Promoted.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Promoted. I got promoted at my job, and he got really mad. He was</br>   like, &quot;Why? It's more...&quot; I was like, &quot;It's less time. It's more money,</br>   less time. Think about it.&quot; He was mad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, are you still together?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: No. Well, kind of. [Chuckles]. We used to fight a lot. His mom,</br>   even though I was working and giving all my money to our home… So we used</br>   to fight a lot because, even though I was working the whole day, I had to</br>   come back home, cook, clean, and do everything that a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> wife should</br>   do. Cook, clean, look after the kid, everything. They would say I would do</br>   nothing. I was sick, and I had to do everything. They didn't work. They</br>   didn't do clean. They wouldn't do anything. They would be attacking me all</br>   the time. His parents, him against me. So I just let it happen. I was just</br>   like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Just do what I have to do for my kid.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, do you ever think of going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Every single day of my life, I think of going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think you might?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: Yes. There's more time than life. That's something I want. I just</br>   want, even if it's for a day, just go back, step to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>, look</br>   around, and remember everything that happened to me there. I'll be happy.</br>   I'll be happy because I miss my house. I miss my family. [Emotional]. Even</br>   though I got most of my family here, it's not the same. They don't care</br>   about you. When I needed my kidney transplant, because I need one, and my</br>   mom told my family that if anybody wanted to donate, nobody answered.</br>   Nobody said, &quot;Hey, I can't, but I'll pray for you.&quot; Nobody. They just</br>   changed the topic. When I told my family in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> that I needed a</br>   kidney, my smallest cousin, he's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">around eighteen</span>, he said, &quot;Hey, I'll give</br>   it to you&quot; right away. It makes me feel like I don't need to see you every</br>   day to be family. You're not my family. My family is in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. They</br>   are my family. They love me. They care about me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you'd like to go back and live there? Would you still join the</br>   army?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: I can't. [Chuckles]. If I could, yes. If I could, I would do it</br>   with the eyes closed. I'd be like, &quot;Hey, I'll decide. I'll sell my life. I</br>   don't care.&quot; If that's going to give my son a better life, I would.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you tell your son about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Olimpya</span>: A lot. He wants to live there too because we go to the parks here.</br>   There's only one park that we like here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Mexican childhood">Anita: How old were you when you left for the US?     Olimpya: I was small. I was around five or six years. I was in first grade.    </span> Anita: You were in first grade?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You grew up in Mexico City or somewhere else?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes, here in—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Here in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My mom used to have a lot of domestic violence problems with my</br>   dad. So normally, we would be leaving the house, and come back, and come</br>   and go. But one day, my uncle, who's an American citizen, came to Mexico</br>   for a vacation. It was in the meantime when we were out of the house. So my</br>   mom saw him. They talked about what was going on, how he can help, and one</br>   day, my mom said, &quot;You know what? We're leaving.&quot; So we grabbed a couple of</br>   clothes, shoes, and we left.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just like that?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. One day to another, we were already on the road. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. We were on the mobile home with my uncle and his family. We</br>   were setting off to Ciudad Juárez. So that's why basically.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As a child, was it scary for you at home?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It was kind of confusing because I was happy because they told me</br>   about Disneyland and all this stuff. I was really happy about that, but</br>   then you look back, and you're like, “My dad, my sisters, my house, my</br>   toys, my things, what's going to happen?&quot; I was happy during the day</br>   because I wouldn't think about it, but at nights, I used to have really bad</br>   dreams about it, about leaving my dad, about everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it was just you who went with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. My two brothers and I.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, somebody stayed behind though? You say your sisters?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Well, I got two more sisters and two more brothers. They're</br>   older. But they're not my mom's. They're my dad's, but we grew up together,</br>   so we're really...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I understand. I understand. So it was really hard to leave all of</br>   this behind.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. But as a kid, you don't think about it. You just, in your</br>   mind, you have it there. You know it's there. I know because, for a whole</br>   year, I used to have really bad dreams where I used to wake up crying. My</br>   mom would be like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; I'm like, &quot;My dad, my dad, my dad.&quot;</br>   She's like, &quot;But it's already a year.&quot; I was like, &quot;I don't know. It just</br>   comes out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember some of the nightmares?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I remember one that it's like really stuck in my mind. It's</br>   really weird. The day we left the house—it's the same house where my dad</br>   lives right now, so it's on the avenue. I remember my mom, she had a truck,</br>   I don't know who give it to her, to take out our stuff. I remember I was</br>   sitting on the back looking like this and seeing my dad. Then I start</br>   crying. That's a dream I can't forget about. I don't know why, but it's</br>   there. [Chuckles]. It's just there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have contact with your dad when you were in the</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but not that much. At the beginning, it was really weird to</br>   talk to him because my mom didn't want him to know that we were over there,</br>   so it was once a month maybe? Then after that, we tried to contact him, but</br>   he was working or with his new family and this lady wouldn't let us talk to</br>   him. Every time I call, she would say, &quot;Ah, he's not here.” I could hear</br>   his voice on the back, so I was like, &quot;I know he's here.&quot; So she wouldn't</br>   let... so things like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A lot of people have told us about domestic violence. Why do you</br>   think there's so much domestic violence?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me. What do you think? Say more.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, here in Mexico, girls or women, we're raised to serve. We're</br>   not raised to think or do something on our own because it's dangerous for</br>   us. But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.</br>   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that</br>   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's</br>   basically it. And since we're raised by Mexican women. So, me as a woman, I</br>   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all</br>   girls here, they're not the same. They think, &quot;No, you're a girl, you need</br>   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.&quot; Then the daughter-in-law comes,</br>   and then she's like, &quot;No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for</br>   my son.&quot; So it's education basically, ignorance.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you think differently? I know I'm getting ahead of</br>   everything—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, it's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: —but it's interesting. Do you think differently because you grew up</br>   in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird</br>   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.</br>   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if</br>   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll</br>   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really</br>   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,</br>   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,</br>   not because they're forcing me too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you also talk about raising your son differently.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in first grade, so he is about the age when</br>   I left. Last week, he came to me. He's like, &quot;Hey, mom. I need to tell you</br>   something, but you're going to get really mad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. Tell</br>   me.&quot; I thought he did something bad. He's like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; [Laughing].</br>   So, I was just like, &quot;Hold on. I was expecting something else.&quot; So he's</br>   like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get</br>   mad at it.&quot; &quot;Wait, mom. It gets worse.” I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;She's in third</br>   grade.&quot; [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Okay. She's old for him,&quot; but inside</br>   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, &quot;Okay. I'm not going to tell</br>   him ‘No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's</br>   too big.’ No.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.</br>   What's the problem?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah. You like</br>   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.&quot;</br>   So, he looked at me and he's like, &quot;Can I write a letter for her?&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Go ahead.&quot; So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since</br>   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,</br>   respect her. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's wonderful. That's a wonderful story.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So just on that, what's it like to have a son who's the same age as</br>   when you left? Does it bring you back?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot</br>   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in</br>   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it</br>   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would he be doing if he were in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.</br>   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The</br>   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your</br>   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really</br>   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't</br>   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable</br>   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get</br>   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really</br>   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,</br>   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He was born here?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, yeah. When I came back after, I think five, six years, I had</br>   him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, tell me about growing up in the States. What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Growing up in the USA was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was the best</br>   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was</br>   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family</br>   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that</br>   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she</br>   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,</br>   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it</br>   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was</br>   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and</br>   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of jobs did your mom have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Factories. She used to work in factories in morning and then at</br>   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She</br>   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and</br>   come back. It was really hard for her.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but</br>   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived</br>   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a</br>   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't</br>   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I</br>   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like</br>   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].</br>   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give</br>   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You</br>   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,</br>   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I</br>   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I</br>   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all</br>   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would</br>   live there, I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were an American kid.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted</br>   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do</br>   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.</br>   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my</br>   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always</br>   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you</br>   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a</br>   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my</br>   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each</br>   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born</br>   on the same day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the day?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: In June 29.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Soon, you're having a birthday?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on the same</br>   day, and we didn't know it. We were just like, &quot;Huh.&quot; But she used to take</br>   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   come here. I'll teach you something.&quot; So she would pull me a lot to</br>   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone—because my brothers</br>   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing—she would</br>   be like, &quot;Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,&quot; and I would</br>   go with her. She's a Christian, and they got a lot of activities on</br>   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over</br>   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,</br>   &quot;Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her</br>   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see</br>   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that</br>   you can't give her at the moment.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So my mom said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and it was the best decision she ever made</br>   because my aunt, I was her daughter. I'm still her daughter. We call each</br>   other. We talk a lot. She saved my life because I was already starting to</br>   go with the girls. I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I</br>   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that</br>   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?</br>   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to</br>   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you</br>   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in</br>   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just</br>   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was</br>   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down</br>   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or</br>   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight</br>   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody</br>   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bit somebody?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I was like, &quot;What? What are you doing?&quot; So it was really</br>   scary for me, and I didn't like it, but you have to do it because you want</br>   friends. If you don't do it, they're going to do it to you. That's when my</br>   aunt came in, and she's like, &quot;Come with.&quot; She saved that part of me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did you find another group of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, yeah, when I went to live with my aunt, it was a whole</br>   different story because I used to live in ___ California. It's a really</br>   Hispanic town.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,</br>   California. It's a really nice little town and really American. So, when I</br>   got there, I was like, &quot;Hey, I like it here.&quot; [Chuckles]. When I got to</br>   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able</br>   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used</br>   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,</br>   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like</br>   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from</br>   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My aunt would be like, &quot;Why don't you go with the Mexicans or just</br>   one group?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I can learn from everybody. You can learn from</br>   everything.&quot; I like how African Americans talk, and how they act, and how</br>   happy they are. Then you also turn around and look at Americans, and you</br>   see how nice and educated they are. They talk about music. They talk about</br>   really cool things. Then you go with my Korean friends, and they teach me</br>   how to draw. You can learn from their cultures and the way they were raised</br>   just by talking to them. That's amazing for me. That's why I used to like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So I was happy. Then my aunt would be like, &quot;Okay. If you can</br>   speak Korean and understand it, it's your problem.&quot; [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you learn Korean?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying</br>   to learn English because first, so I was like, &quot;Okay, it's hard.&quot; [Laughs].</br>   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak English really</br>   well, so we were like, &quot;Uh.&quot; We make hand signs so it was fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom</br>   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your</br>   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she</br>   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my</br>   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking</br>   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So again—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We start all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All over again.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Around fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that</br>   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had</br>   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I</br>   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,</br>   hey, it's not my house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in America. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the States, house are really big. And</br>   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.</br>   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.</br>   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're</br>   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;</br>   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're</br>   leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she</br>   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an</br>   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was</br>   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.</br>   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.</br>   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me</br>   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going</br>   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.</br>   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show</br>   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I</br>   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and</br>   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems</br>   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent</br>   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.</br>   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this</br>   back in the States. This was third-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but</br>   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I</br>   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many years ago was this? How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I'm twenty-six.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you came back when you were fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, around eleven years, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. How come your English is still so good?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I practice a lot. I used to work in call centers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, but still.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Laughs]. Then I talk to my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, my</br>   brother, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You talk to them in English?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah, we try to keep it in English, so I can still practice.</br>   When I used to work, it was everything in English. So I try to practice a</br>   lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did anything get any better?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, &quot;Okay. If I'm</br>   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can</br>   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.</br>   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying</br>   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't</br>   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The</br>   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They</br>   wouldn't check on you like, &quot;It's your responsibility to come to school,</br>   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.&quot; Basically,</br>   what we used to do in the mornings, we had to be at school at 5:00 AM</br>   because we used to cook in the morning. Then around 7:00—we had, 7:00 to</br>   8:00, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we</br>   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in</br>   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.</br>   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would</br>   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get</br>   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My</br>   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out</br>   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You</br>   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is</br>   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going</br>   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come</br>   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she</br>   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It</br>   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: But then, I met this guy who is my baby's dad. He was from the</br>   best kids there were because you could find worse. He would be like, &quot;No,</br>   go in your classes. Be good. You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;Hey, he's protecting me.&quot; I found somebody to protect me,</br>   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish</br>   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and</br>   I couldn't go to school no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What sickness did you have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't know what it's called in English. It's Trombocitopénica</br>   Púrpura-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thrombosis—thrombosis of something, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. My blood is like water. Be like water. Then if you touch me</br>   like that, even if you go like that, you will see a big... I don't know how</br>   you say moretón. Bruise?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bruise.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I will get a really big bruise even if you go like that. So</br>   I had to stay in bed for a really long time, and I got medicated. I</br>   couldn't go to school. I lost a year. Then I tried to go back, and then I</br>   got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay. This is not for me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when you got pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Nineteen. Yeah, nineteen. Then I got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay.</br>   I'm just going to take care of my son, my family. I just want to have a</br>   family like my aunt's family in the US.&quot; That's what I wanted. I started</br>   working on that. I was really happy at that moment. I was pregnant. I was</br>   going to have my kid. I had my husband. He loved me. Everything was</br>   perfect, but then, this president with his political things came with the</br>   reforma energetica.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, the energy reform.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: And screw everything up for his family and for everything. So—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean? Why did the energy reform—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: This reform, whenever they change presidents, everything in Mexico</br>   is stopped for a really long time, about a year. My boyfriend's family, at</br>   that time, used to sell... How do you say tubos?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The tubes.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Tubes for Pemex, the ones they use to transport everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Petrols, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: They used to sell those big tubes to them. So once the person</br>   came, they stopped everything. They were fine because they knew what's</br>   going to happen, but then he said, &quot;Reforma energetica.&quot; They stopped it</br>   for a really long time more. So they didn't have the money. They weren't</br>   working no more. They didn't have enough money to survive to that. So until</br>   the time right now, they haven't sell anything to Pemex. Pemex is not</br>   buying nothing. That's already what? Six, seven years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So which president are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Peña Nieto.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So this guy comes in, screws everything up for everybody because</br>   we're not the only family. We know families that they were millionaires.</br>   And right now, they don't have a peso. So problems come out on our side. We</br>   don't have money. We have to go live with his parents, and his mom is not</br>   the best person ever. She's a really Mexican woman like, &quot;You have to do</br>   this, this, this.&quot; [Chuckles]. I'm like, &quot;I'm pregnant. How can I explain</br>   to you?&quot; Because I got pregnant again. After two years, I got pregnant. She</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, take that clothes upstairs to hang because I can't, my</br>   knees hurt.” And I was like, “I'm pregnant. I can't carry and go up five</br>   levels of stairs. I can't.&quot; So she would make me do it because I was living</br>   at her house. I had to clean, cook, do everything for everybody since I was</br>   living at their house, and she wouldn't do anything. Then on top of that,</br>   when I used to feel bad like headaches or something like that, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, no. Wake up. Get up. You need to do this.&quot; Like that. I don't</br>   know if I was weak, [Chuckle] if I'm a weak woman or not, or it was too</br>   much what I had to do in that stage, but I ended up losing my baby. I lost</br>   my kidney. I lost both of my kidneys.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I lost my kidneys and so I was sick. I've just been trying to</br>   survive. I don't know if I learned or I just decided not to do more than I</br>   have to, to survive because whenever you try to do the best you can, people</br>   don't think the same way as you. My baby's dad don't think the same way as</br>   me. I don't know if he doesn't want the family that I want or worse. We</br>   don't have the same culture. When I started working, he used to get really</br>   mad. He used to get really jealous. He would be like, &quot;Hey, no. Don't talk</br>   to this person. Don't talk to this person. No, you can't do that.&quot; Then I</br>   got ascended, ascent? Promotion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Promoted.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Promoted. I got promoted at my job, and he got really mad. He was</br>   like, &quot;Why? It's more...&quot; I was like, &quot;It's less time. It's more money,</br>   less time. Think about it.&quot; He was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, are you still together?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. Well, kind of. [Chuckles]. We used to fight a lot. His mom,</br>   even though I was working and giving all my money to our home… So we used</br>   to fight a lot because, even though I was working the whole day, I had to</br>   come back home, cook, clean, and do everything that a Mexican wife should</br>   do. Cook, clean, look after the kid, everything. They would say I would do</br>   nothing. I was sick, and I had to do everything. They didn't work. They</br>   didn't do clean. They wouldn't do anything. They would be attacking me all</br>   the time. His parents, him against me. So I just let it happen. I was just</br>   like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Just do what I have to do for my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you ever think of going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Every single day of my life, I think of going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you might?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Family Separation, Illness, Mental Health">Olimpya: Yes. There's more time than life. That's something I want. I just   want, even if it's for a day, just go back, step to United States, look   around, and remember everything that happened to me there. I'll be happy.   I'll be happy because I miss my house. I miss my family. [Emotional]. Even   though I got most of my family here, it's not the same. They don't care   about you. When I needed my kidney transplant, because I need one, and my   mom told my family that if anybody wanted to donate, nobody answered.   Nobody said, &quot;Hey, I can't, but I'll pray for you.&quot; Nobody. They just   changed the topic. When I told my family in the States that I needed a   kidney, my smallest cousin, he's around eighteen, he said, &quot;Hey, I'll give   it to you&quot; right away. It makes me feel like I don't need to see you every   day to be family. You're not my family. My family is in the States. They   are my family. They love me. They care about me.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Challenges, Continuing education, Mental Health, Addiction, Abuse">Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, &quot;Okay. If I'm   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks.

We would   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.     Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, School, Bullying, Discrimination, Gangs, Fights, Violence">Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're   leaving.&quot;     Anita: What happened?     Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].     Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?     Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this   back in the States. This was third-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Return to Mexico, Challenges, Continuing education, Cultural differences, School, High school, Discrimination, Bullying">Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;     Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Dreams,  careers,  Army,  military">Anita: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?     Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.     Anita: In what?     Olimpya: Army.     Anita: You wanted to join the army?     Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.     Anita: Why?     Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my   biggest dream.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Paying For, Family, Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;     Anita: So again—     Olimpya: We start all over.     Anita: All over again.     Olimpya: Yes.     Anita: How old were you?     Olimpya: Around fifteen?     Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,   hey, it's not my house.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Friends, Gangs, Fights, Violence">I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Pastimes, Sports, Playing,  football, Feelings, Happiness, Homelife, Family">Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]     Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born   on the same day.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, Middle school, Favorite subjects,  math, Teachers, Mentors, Working hard, getting good grades, Working hard, getting good grades,  extracurriculars, Sports,  basketball, Music,  violin, Feelings, Happiness,  fulfillment">Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would   live there, I was happy.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Careers,  exploitation,  factory">Anita: What kind of jobs did your mom have?     Olimpya: Factories. She used to work in factories in morning and then at   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and   come back. It was really hard for her.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Family Separation">Olimpya: Yeah, but not that much. At the beginning, it was really weird to   talk to him because my mom didn't want him to know that we were over there,   so it was once a month maybe? Then after that, we tried to contact him, but   he was working or with his new family and this lady wouldn't let us talk to   him. Every time I call, she would say, &quot;Ah, he's not here.” I could hear   his voice on the back, so I was like, &quot;I know he's here.&quot; So she wouldn't   let... so things like that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Mexican childhood, School, Memories">Anita: How old were you when you left for the US?

Olimpya: Yes, here in—     Anita: Here in Mexico City.     Olimpya: [Affirmative noise].    </span> Anita: Why did you migrate?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My mom used to have a lot of domestic violence problems with my</br>   dad. So normally, we would be leaving the house, and come back, and come</br>   and go. But one day, my uncle, who's an American citizen, came to Mexico</br>   for a vacation. It was in the meantime when we were out of the house. So my</br>   mom saw him. They talked about what was going on, how he can help, and one</br>   day, my mom said, &quot;You know what? We're leaving.&quot; So we grabbed a couple of</br>   clothes, shoes, and we left.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just like that?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. One day to another, we were already on the road. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. We were on the mobile home with my uncle and his family. We</br>   were setting off to Ciudad Juárez. So that's why basically.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As a child, was it scary for you at home?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It was kind of confusing because I was happy because they told me</br>   about Disneyland and all this stuff. I was really happy about that, but</br>   then you look back, and you're like, “My dad, my sisters, my house, my</br>   toys, my things, what's going to happen?&quot; I was happy during the day</br>   because I wouldn't think about it, but at nights, I used to have really bad</br>   dreams about it, about leaving my dad, about everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it was just you who went with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. My two brothers and I.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, somebody stayed behind though? You say your sisters?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Well, I got two more sisters and two more brothers. They're</br>   older. But they're not my mom's. They're my dad's, but we grew up together,</br>   so we're really...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I understand. I understand. So it was really hard to leave all of</br>   this behind.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. But as a kid, you don't think about it. You just, in your</br>   mind, you have it there. You know it's there. I know because, for a whole</br>   year, I used to have really bad dreams where I used to wake up crying. My</br>   mom would be like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; I'm like, &quot;My dad, my dad, my dad.&quot;</br>   She's like, &quot;But it's already a year.&quot; I was like, &quot;I don't know. It just</br>   comes out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember some of the nightmares?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I remember one that it's like really stuck in my mind. It's</br>   really weird. The day we left the house—it's the same house where my dad</br>   lives right now, so it's on the avenue. I remember my mom, she had a truck,</br>   I don't know who give it to her, to take out our stuff. I remember I was</br>   sitting on the back looking like this and seeing my dad. Then I start</br>   crying. That's a dream I can't forget about. I don't know why, but it's</br>   there. [Chuckles]. It's just there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have contact with your dad when you were in the</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but not that much. At the beginning, it was really weird to</br>   talk to him because my mom didn't want him to know that we were over there,</br>   so it was once a month maybe? Then after that, we tried to contact him, but</br>   he was working or with his new family and this lady wouldn't let us talk to</br>   him. Every time I call, she would say, &quot;Ah, he's not here.” I could hear</br>   his voice on the back, so I was like, &quot;I know he's here.&quot; So she wouldn't</br>   let... so things like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A lot of people have told us about domestic violence. Why do you</br>   think there's so much domestic violence?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me. What do you think? Say more.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, here in Mexico, girls or women, we're raised to serve. We're</br>   not raised to think or do something on our own because it's dangerous for</br>   us. But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.</br>   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that</br>   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's</br>   basically it. And since we're raised by Mexican women. So, me as a woman, I</br>   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all</br>   girls here, they're not the same. They think, &quot;No, you're a girl, you need</br>   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.&quot; Then the daughter-in-law comes,</br>   and then she's like, &quot;No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for</br>   my son.&quot; So it's education basically, ignorance.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you think differently? I know I'm getting ahead of</br>   everything—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, it's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: —but it's interesting. Do you think differently because you grew up</br>   in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird</br>   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.</br>   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if</br>   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll</br>   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really</br>   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,</br>   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,</br>   not because they're forcing me too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you also talk about raising your son differently.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in first grade, so he is about the age when</br>   I left. Last week, he came to me. He's like, &quot;Hey, mom. I need to tell you</br>   something, but you're going to get really mad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. Tell</br>   me.&quot; I thought he did something bad. He's like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; [Laughing].</br>   So, I was just like, &quot;Hold on. I was expecting something else.&quot; So he's</br>   like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get</br>   mad at it.&quot; &quot;Wait, mom. It gets worse.” I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;She's in third</br>   grade.&quot; [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Okay. She's old for him,&quot; but inside</br>   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, &quot;Okay. I'm not going to tell</br>   him ‘No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's</br>   too big.’ No.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.</br>   What's the problem?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah. You like</br>   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.&quot;</br>   So, he looked at me and he's like, &quot;Can I write a letter for her?&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Go ahead.&quot; So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since</br>   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,</br>   respect her. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's wonderful. That's a wonderful story.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So just on that, what's it like to have a son who's the same age as</br>   when you left? Does it bring you back?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot</br>   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in</br>   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it</br>   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would he be doing if he were in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.</br>   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The</br>   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your</br>   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really</br>   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't</br>   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable</br>   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get</br>   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really</br>   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,</br>   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He was born here?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, yeah. When I came back after, I think five, six years, I had</br>   him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, tell me about growing up in the States. What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Growing up in the USA was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was the best</br>   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was</br>   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family</br>   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that</br>   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she</br>   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,</br>   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it</br>   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was</br>   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and</br>   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of jobs did your mom have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Factories. She used to work in factories in morning and then at</br>   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She</br>   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and</br>   come back. It was really hard for her.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but</br>   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived</br>   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a</br>   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't</br>   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I</br>   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like</br>   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].</br>   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give</br>   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You</br>   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,</br>   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I</br>   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I</br>   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all</br>   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would</br>   live there, I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were an American kid.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted</br>   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do</br>   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.</br>   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my</br>   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always</br>   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you</br>   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a</br>   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my</br>   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each</br>   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born</br>   on the same day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the day?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: In June 29.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Soon, you're having a birthday?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on the same</br>   day, and we didn't know it. We were just like, &quot;Huh.&quot; But she used to take</br>   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   come here. I'll teach you something.&quot; So she would pull me a lot to</br>   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone—because my brothers</br>   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing—she would</br>   be like, &quot;Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,&quot; and I would</br>   go with her. She's a Christian, and they got a lot of activities on</br>   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over</br>   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,</br>   &quot;Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her</br>   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see</br>   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that</br>   you can't give her at the moment.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So my mom said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and it was the best decision she ever made</br>   because my aunt, I was her daughter. I'm still her daughter. We call each</br>   other. We talk a lot. She saved my life because I was already starting to</br>   go with the girls. I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I</br>   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that</br>   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?</br>   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to</br>   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you</br>   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in</br>   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just</br>   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was</br>   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down</br>   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or</br>   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight</br>   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody</br>   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bit somebody?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I was like, &quot;What? What are you doing?&quot; So it was really</br>   scary for me, and I didn't like it, but you have to do it because you want</br>   friends. If you don't do it, they're going to do it to you. That's when my</br>   aunt came in, and she's like, &quot;Come with.&quot; She saved that part of me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did you find another group of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, yeah, when I went to live with my aunt, it was a whole</br>   different story because I used to live in ___ California. It's a really</br>   Hispanic town.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,</br>   California. It's a really nice little town and really American. So, when I</br>   got there, I was like, &quot;Hey, I like it here.&quot; [Chuckles]. When I got to</br>   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able</br>   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used</br>   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,</br>   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like</br>   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from</br>   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My aunt would be like, &quot;Why don't you go with the Mexicans or just</br>   one group?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I can learn from everybody. You can learn from</br>   everything.&quot; I like how African Americans talk, and how they act, and how</br>   happy they are. Then you also turn around and look at Americans, and you</br>   see how nice and educated they are. They talk about music. They talk about</br>   really cool things. Then you go with my Korean friends, and they teach me</br>   how to draw. You can learn from their cultures and the way they were raised</br>   just by talking to them. That's amazing for me. That's why I used to like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So I was happy. Then my aunt would be like, &quot;Okay. If you can</br>   speak Korean and understand it, it's your problem.&quot; [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you learn Korean?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying</br>   to learn English because first, so I was like, &quot;Okay, it's hard.&quot; [Laughs].</br>   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak English really</br>   well, so we were like, &quot;Uh.&quot; We make hand signs so it was fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom</br>   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your</br>   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she</br>   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my</br>   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking</br>   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So again—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We start all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All over again.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Around fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that</br>   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had</br>   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I</br>   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,</br>   hey, it's not my house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in America. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the States, house are really big. And</br>   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.</br>   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.</br>   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're</br>   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;</br>   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're</br>   leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she</br>   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an</br>   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was</br>   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.</br>   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.</br>   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me</br>   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going</br>   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.</br>   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show</br>   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I</br>   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and</br>   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems</br>   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent</br>   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.</br>   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this</br>   back in the States. This was third-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but</br>   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I</br>   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many years ago was this? How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I'm twenty-six.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you came back when you were fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, around eleven years, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. How come your English is still so good?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I practice a lot. I used to work in call centers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, but still.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Laughs]. Then I talk to my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, my</br>   brother, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You talk to them in English?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah, we try to keep it in English, so I can still practice.</br>   When I used to work, it was everything in English. So I try to practice a</br>   lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did anything get any better?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, &quot;Okay. If I'm</br>   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can</br>   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.</br>   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying</br>   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't</br>   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The</br>   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They</br>   wouldn't check on you like, &quot;It's your responsibility to come to school,</br>   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.&quot; Basically,</br>   what we used to do in the mornings, we had to be at school at 5:00 AM</br>   because we used to cook in the morning. Then around 7:00—we had, 7:00 to</br>   8:00, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we</br>   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in</br>   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.</br>   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would</br>   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get</br>   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My</br>   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out</br>   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You</br>   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is</br>   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going</br>   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come</br>   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she</br>   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It</br>   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: But then, I met this guy who is my baby's dad. He was from the</br>   best kids there were because you could find worse. He would be like, &quot;No,</br>   go in your classes. Be good. You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;Hey, he's protecting me.&quot; I found somebody to protect me,</br>   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish</br>   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and</br>   I couldn't go to school no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What sickness did you have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't know what it's called in English. It's Trombocitopénica</br>   Púrpura-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thrombosis—thrombosis of something, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. My blood is like water. Be like water. Then if you touch me</br>   like that, even if you go like that, you will see a big... I don't know how</br>   you say moretón. Bruise?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bruise.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I will get a really big bruise even if you go like that. So</br>   I had to stay in bed for a really long time, and I got medicated. I</br>   couldn't go to school. I lost a year. Then I tried to go back, and then I</br>   got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay. This is not for me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when you got pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US">Olimpya: Nineteen. Yeah, nineteen. Then I got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay.   I'm just going to take care of my son, my family. I just want to have a   family like my aunt's family in the US.&quot; That's what I wanted. I started   working on that. I was really happy at that moment. I was pregnant. I was   going to have my kid. I had my husband. He loved me. Everything was   perfect, but then, this president with his political things came with the   reforma energetica.    </span> Anita: Yeah, the energy reform.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: And screw everything up for his family and for everything. So—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean? Why did the energy reform—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: This reform, whenever they change presidents, everything in Mexico</br>   is stopped for a really long time, about a year. My boyfriend's family, at</br>   that time, used to sell... How do you say tubos?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The tubes.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Tubes for Pemex, the ones they use to transport everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Petrols, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: They used to sell those big tubes to them. So once the person</br>   came, they stopped everything. They were fine because they knew what's</br>   going to happen, but then he said, &quot;Reforma energetica.&quot; They stopped it</br>   for a really long time more. So they didn't have the money. They weren't</br>   working no more. They didn't have enough money to survive to that. So until</br>   the time right now, they haven't sell anything to Pemex. Pemex is not</br>   buying nothing. That's already what? Six, seven years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So which president are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Peña Nieto.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So this guy comes in, screws everything up for everybody because</br>   we're not the only family. We know families that they were millionaires.</br>   And right now, they don't have a peso. So problems come out on our side. We</br>   don't have money. We have to go live with his parents, and his mom is not</br>   the best person ever. She's a really Mexican woman like, &quot;You have to do</br>   this, this, this.&quot; [Chuckles]. I'm like, &quot;I'm pregnant. How can I explain</br>   to you?&quot; Because I got pregnant again. After two years, I got pregnant. She</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, take that clothes upstairs to hang because I can't, my</br>   knees hurt.” And I was like, “I'm pregnant. I can't carry and go up five</br>   levels of stairs. I can't.&quot; So she would make me do it because I was living</br>   at her house. I had to clean, cook, do everything for everybody since I was</br>   living at their house, and she wouldn't do anything. Then on top of that,</br>   when I used to feel bad like headaches or something like that, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, no. Wake up. Get up. You need to do this.&quot; Like that. I don't</br>   know if I was weak, [Chuckle] if I'm a weak woman or not, or it was too</br>   much what I had to do in that stage, but I ended up losing my baby. I lost</br>   my kidney. I lost both of my kidneys.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Illness">Olimpya: I lost my kidneys and so I was sick. I've just been trying to   survive. I don't know if I learned or I just decided not to do more than I   have to, to survive because whenever you try to do the best you can, people   don't think the same way as you. My baby's dad don't think the same way as   me. I don't know if he doesn't want the family that I want or worse. We   don't have the same culture. When I started working, he used to get really   mad. He used to get really jealous. He would be like, &quot;Hey, no. Don't talk   to this person. Don't talk to this person. No, you can't do that.&quot; Then I   got ascended, ascent? Promotion.    </span> Anita: Promoted.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Promoted. I got promoted at my job, and he got really mad. He was</br>   like, &quot;Why? It's more...&quot; I was like, &quot;It's less time. It's more money,</br>   less time. Think about it.&quot; He was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, are you still together?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. Well, kind of. [Chuckles]. We used to fight a lot. His mom,</br>   even though I was working and giving all my money to our home… So we used</br>   to fight a lot because, even though I was working the whole day, I had to</br>   come back home, cook, clean, and do everything that a Mexican wife should</br>   do. Cook, clean, look after the kid, everything. They would say I would do</br>   nothing. I was sick, and I had to do everything. They didn't work. They</br>   didn't do clean. They wouldn't do anything. They would be attacking me all</br>   the time. His parents, him against me. So I just let it happen. I was just</br>   like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Just do what I have to do for my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you ever think of going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Every single day of my life, I think of going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you might?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. There's more time than life. That's something I want. I just</br>   want, even if it's for a day, just go back, step to United States, look</br>   around, and remember everything that happened to me there. I'll be happy.</br>   I'll be happy because I miss my house. I miss my family. [Emotional]. Even</br>   though I got most of my family here, it's not the same. They don't care</br>   about you. When I needed my kidney transplant, because I need one, and my</br>   mom told my family that if anybody wanted to donate, nobody answered.</br>   Nobody said, &quot;Hey, I can't, but I'll pray for you.&quot; Nobody. They just</br>   changed the topic. When I told my family in the States that I needed a</br>   kidney, my smallest cousin, he's around eighteen, he said, &quot;Hey, I'll give</br>   it to you&quot; right away. It makes me feel like I don't need to see you every</br>   day to be family. You're not my family. My family is in the States. They</br>   are my family. They love me. They care about me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you'd like to go back and live there? Would you still join the</br>   army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I can't. [Chuckles]. If I could, yes. If I could, I would do it</br>   with the eyes closed. I'd be like, &quot;Hey, I'll decide. I'll sell my life. I</br>   don't care.&quot; If that's going to give my son a better life, I would.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you tell your son about the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being">Olimpya: A lot. He wants to live there too because we go to the parks here.   There's only one park that we like here in Mexico City. It's really close   our house because the other ones are really bad. They don't have grass.   It's like, &quot;You know what grass is, right?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, I want to see   grass, Mommy. I want to see grass.&quot; [Laughing]. I'm like, &quot;Okay. Let's go   find a park with grass,&quot; because they don't have grass. The playground is   destroyed. It's </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Time in the US,  careers,  military/army">Olimpya: I can't. [Chuckles]. If I could, yes. If I could, I would do it   with the eyes closed. I'd be like, &quot;Hey, I'll decide. I'll sell my life. I   don't care.&quot; If that's going to give my son a better life, I would.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Illness">Olimpya: Yes.

I don't   know if I was weak, [Chuckle] if I'm a weak woman or not, or it was too   much what I had to do in that stage, but I ended up losing my baby. I lost   my kidney. I lost both of my kidneys.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out, Time in the US, Illness">Olimpya: Yeah.

This is not for me.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Illness">Olimpya: Yeah. My blood is like water. Be like water.

It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out">Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit.

So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything.

My mom was really mad at me because she   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Learning English/ ESL">Olimpya: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying   to learn English because first, so I was like, &quot;Okay, it's hard.&quot; [Laughs].   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak English really   well, so we were like, &quot;Uh.&quot; We make hand signs so it was fun. [Laughs].    </span> Anita: Did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom</br>   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your</br>   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she</br>   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my</br>   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking</br>   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So again—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We start all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All over again.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Around fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that</br>   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had</br>   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I</br>   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,</br>   hey, it's not my house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in America. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the States, house are really big. And</br>   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.</br>   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out">They're doing this.

She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife, Living situation">Olimpya: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,   California. It's a really nice little town and really American. So, when I   got there, I was like, &quot;Hey, I like it here.&quot; [Chuckles]. When I got to   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Olimpya: So my mom said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and it was the best decision she ever made   because my aunt, I was her daughter. I'm still her daughter. We call each   other. We talk a lot. She saved my life because I was already starting to   go with the girls. I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Parents/step-parents">Olimpya: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on the same   day, and we didn't know it. We were just like, &quot;Huh.&quot; But she used to take   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, &quot;Oh,   come here. I'll teach you something.&quot; So she would pull me a lot to   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone—because my brothers   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing—she would   be like, &quot;Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,&quot; and I would   go with her. She's a Christian, and they got a lot of activities on   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,   &quot;Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that   you can't give her at the moment.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife">Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born   on the same day.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Pastimes, Sports, Playing">Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School">Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would   live there, I was happy.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Grandparents">Olimpya: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Olimpya: Factories. She used to work in factories in morning and then at   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and   come back. It was really hard for her.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife">Olimpya: Growing up in the USA was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was the best   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Favorite parts">Olimpya: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Children">Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections">Anita: So just on that, what's it like to have a son who's the same age as   when you left? Does it bring you back?     Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in first grade, so he is about the age when   I left. Last week, he came to me. He's like, &quot;Hey, mom. I need to tell you   something, but you're going to get really mad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. Tell   me.&quot; I thought he did something bad. He's like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; [Laughing].   So, I was just like, &quot;Hold on. I was expecting something else.&quot; So he's   like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get   mad at it.&quot; &quot;Wait, mom. It gets worse.” I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;She's in third   grade.&quot; [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Okay. She's old for him,&quot; but inside   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, &quot;Okay. I'm not going to tell   him ‘No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's   too big.’ No.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.   What's the problem?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah. You like   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.&quot;   So, he looked at me and he's like, &quot;Can I write a letter for her?&quot; I was   like, &quot;Go ahead.&quot; So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,   respect her. That's it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Mexico">Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah.

That's it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Identity, The United States">Olimpya: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,   not because they're forcing me too.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico">Anita: A lot of people have told us about domestic violence. Why do you   think there's so much domestic violence?     Olimpya: Culture.     Anita: Tell me. What do you think? Say more.     Olimpya: Well, here in Mexico, girls or women, we're raised to serve. We're   not raised to think or do something on our own because it's dangerous for   us. But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's   basically it. And since we're raised by Mexican women. So, me as a woman, I   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all   girls here, they're not the same. They think, &quot;No, you're a girl, you need   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.&quot; Then the daughter-in-law comes,   and then she's like, &quot;No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for   my son.&quot; So it's education basically, ignorance.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Parents/step-parents, Family Separation">Olimpya: Yeah, but not that much. At the beginning, it was really weird to   talk to him because my mom didn't want him to know that we were over there,   so it was once a month maybe? Then after that, we tried to contact him, but   he was working or with his new family and this lady wouldn't let us talk to   him. Every time I call, she would say, &quot;Ah, he's not here.” I could hear   his voice on the back, so I was like, &quot;I know he's here.&quot; So she wouldn't   let... so things like that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in Mexico">Anita: So, it was just you who went with your mom?

So normally, we would be leaving the house, and come back, and come   and go. But one day, my uncle, who's an American citizen, came to Mexico   for a vacation. It was in the meantime when we were out of the house. So my   mom saw him. They talked about what was going on, how he can help, and one   day, my mom said, &quot;You know what?

So it was really hard to leave all of</br>   this behind.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. But as a kid, you don't think about it. You just, in your</br>   mind, you have it there. You know it's there. I know because, for a whole</br>   year, I used to have really bad dreams where I used to wake up crying. My</br>   mom would be like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; I'm like, &quot;My dad, my dad, my dad.&quot;</br>   She's like, &quot;But it's already a year.&quot; I was like, &quot;I don't know. It just</br>   comes out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember some of the nightmares?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I remember one that it's like really stuck in my mind. It's</br>   really weird. The day we left the house—it's the same house where my dad</br>   lives right now, so it's on the avenue. I remember my mom, she had a truck,</br>   I don't know who give it to her, to take out our stuff. I remember I was</br>   sitting on the back looking like this and seeing my dad. Then I start</br>   crying. That's a dream I can't forget about. I don't know why, but it's</br>   there. [Chuckles]. It's just there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have contact with your dad when you were in the</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but not that much. At the beginning, it was really weird to</br>   talk to him because my mom didn't want him to know that we were over there,</br>   so it was once a month maybe?

I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all</br>   girls here, they're not the same. They think, &quot;No, you're a girl, you need</br>   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.&quot; Then the daughter-in-law comes,</br>   and then she's like, &quot;No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for</br>   my son.&quot; So it's education basically, ignorance.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you think differently? I know I'm getting ahead of</br>   everything—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, it's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: —but it's interesting. Do you think differently because you grew up</br>   in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird</br>   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.</br>   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house.

I know I'm really</br>   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,</br>   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,</br>   not because they're forcing me too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you also talk about raising your son differently.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in first grade, so he is about the age when</br>   I left. Last week, he came to me. He's like, &quot;Hey, mom. I need to tell you</br>   something, but you're going to get really mad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. Tell</br>   me.&quot; I thought he did something bad. He's like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; [Laughing].</br>   So, I was just like, &quot;Hold on. I was expecting something else.&quot; So he's</br>   like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get</br>   mad at it.&quot; &quot;Wait, mom. It gets worse.” I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;She's in third</br>   grade.&quot; [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Okay. She's old for him,&quot; but inside</br>   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, &quot;Okay. I'm not going to tell</br>   him ‘No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's</br>   too big.’ No.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.</br>   What's the problem?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah. You like</br>   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.&quot;</br>   So, he looked at me and he's like, &quot;Can I write a letter for her?&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Go ahead.&quot; So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since</br>   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,</br>   respect her. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's wonderful. That's a wonderful story.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So just on that, what's it like to have a son who's the same age as</br>   when you left? Does it bring you back?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot</br>   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in</br>   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it</br>   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would he be doing if he were in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.</br>   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The</br>   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your</br>   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really</br>   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't</br>   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable</br>   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get</br>   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really</br>   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,</br>   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He was born here?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, yeah. When I came back after, I think five, six years, I had</br>   him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, tell me about growing up in the States. What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Growing up in the USA was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was the best</br>   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was</br>   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family</br>   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that</br>   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she</br>   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,</br>   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it</br>   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was</br>   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and</br>   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of jobs did your mom have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Factories. She used to work in factories in morning and then at</br>   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She</br>   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and</br>   come back. It was really hard for her.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but</br>   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived</br>   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a</br>   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't</br>   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I</br>   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like</br>   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].</br>   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give</br>   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You</br>   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,</br>   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I</br>   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I</br>   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all</br>   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would</br>   live there, I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were an American kid.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted</br>   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do</br>   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.</br>   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my</br>   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always</br>   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you</br>   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a</br>   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my</br>   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each</br>   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born</br>   on the same day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the day?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: In June 29.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Soon, you're having a birthday?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on the same</br>   day, and we didn't know it. We were just like, &quot;Huh.&quot; But she used to take</br>   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   come here. I'll teach you something.&quot; So she would pull me a lot to</br>   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone—because my brothers</br>   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing—she would</br>   be like, &quot;Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,&quot; and I would</br>   go with her. She's a Christian, and they got a lot of activities on</br>   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over</br>   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,</br>   &quot;Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her</br>   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see</br>   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that</br>   you can't give her at the moment.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So my mom said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and it was the best decision she ever made</br>   because my aunt, I was her daughter. I'm still her daughter. We call each</br>   other. We talk a lot. She saved my life because I was already starting to</br>   go with the girls. I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I</br>   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that</br>   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?</br>   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to</br>   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you</br>   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in</br>   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just</br>   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was</br>   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down</br>   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or</br>   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight</br>   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody</br>   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bit somebody?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I was like, &quot;What? What are you doing?&quot; So it was really</br>   scary for me, and I didn't like it, but you have to do it because you want</br>   friends. If you don't do it, they're going to do it to you. That's when my</br>   aunt came in, and she's like, &quot;Come with.&quot; She saved that part of me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did you find another group of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, yeah, when I went to live with my aunt, it was a whole</br>   different story because I used to live in ___ California. It's a really</br>   Hispanic town.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,</br>   California. It's a really nice little town and really American. So, when I</br>   got there, I was like, &quot;Hey, I like it here.&quot; [Chuckles]. When I got to</br>   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able</br>   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used</br>   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,</br>   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like</br>   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from</br>   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My aunt would be like, &quot;Why don't you go with the Mexicans or just</br>   one group?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I can learn from everybody. You can learn from</br>   everything.&quot; I like how African Americans talk, and how they act, and how</br>   happy they are. Then you also turn around and look at Americans, and you</br>   see how nice and educated they are. They talk about music. They talk about</br>   really cool things. Then you go with my Korean friends, and they teach me</br>   how to draw. You can learn from their cultures and the way they were raised</br>   just by talking to them. That's amazing for me. That's why I used to like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So I was happy. Then my aunt would be like, &quot;Okay. If you can</br>   speak Korean and understand it, it's your problem.&quot; [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you learn Korean?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying</br>   to learn English because first, so I was like, &quot;Okay, it's hard.&quot; [Laughs].</br>   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak English really</br>   well, so we were like, &quot;Uh.&quot; We make hand signs so it was fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom</br>   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your</br>   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she</br>   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my</br>   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking</br>   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So again—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We start all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All over again.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Around fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that</br>   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had</br>   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I</br>   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,</br>   hey, it's not my house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in America. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the States, house are really big. And</br>   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.</br>   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.</br>   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're</br>   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;</br>   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're</br>   leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she</br>   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an</br>   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was</br>   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.</br>   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.</br>   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me</br>   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going</br>   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.</br>   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show</br>   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I</br>   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and</br>   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems</br>   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent</br>   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.</br>   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this</br>   back in the States. This was third-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but</br>   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I</br>   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many years ago was this? How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I'm twenty-six.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you came back when you were fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, around eleven years, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. How come your English is still so good?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I practice a lot. I used to work in call centers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, but still.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Laughs]. Then I talk to my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, my</br>   brother, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You talk to them in English?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah, we try to keep it in English, so I can still practice.</br>   When I used to work, it was everything in English. So I try to practice a</br>   lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did anything get any better?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, &quot;Okay. If I'm</br>   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can</br>   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.</br>   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying</br>   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't</br>   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The</br>   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They</br>   wouldn't check on you like, &quot;It's your responsibility to come to school,</br>   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.&quot; Basically,</br>   what we used to do in the mornings, we had to be at school at 5:00 AM</br>   because we used to cook in the morning. Then around 7:00—we had, 7:00 to</br>   8:00, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we</br>   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in</br>   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.</br>   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would</br>   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get</br>   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My</br>   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out</br>   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You</br>   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is</br>   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going</br>   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come</br>   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she</br>   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It</br>   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: But then, I met this guy who is my baby's dad. He was from the</br>   best kids there were because you could find worse. He would be like, &quot;No,</br>   go in your classes. Be good. You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;Hey, he's protecting me.&quot; I found somebody to protect me,</br>   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish</br>   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and</br>   I couldn't go to school no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What sickness did you have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't know what it's called in English. It's Trombocitopénica</br>   Púrpura-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thrombosis—thrombosis of something, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. My blood is like water. Be like water. Then if you touch me</br>   like that, even if you go like that, you will see a big... I don't know how</br>   you say moretón. Bruise?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bruise.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I will get a really big bruise even if you go like that. So</br>   I had to stay in bed for a really long time, and I got medicated. I</br>   couldn't go to school. I lost a year. Then I tried to go back, and then I</br>   got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay. This is not for me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when you got pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Nineteen. Yeah, nineteen. Then I got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay.</br>   I'm just going to take care of my son, my family. I just want to have a</br>   family like my aunt's family in the US.&quot; That's what I wanted. I started</br>   working on that. I was really happy at that moment. I was pregnant. I was</br>   going to have my kid. I had my husband. He loved me. Everything was</br>   perfect, but then, this president with his political things came with the</br>   reforma energetica.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, the energy reform.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: And screw everything up for his family and for everything. So—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean? Why did the energy reform—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: This reform, whenever they change presidents, everything in Mexico</br>   is stopped for a really long time, about a year. My boyfriend's family, at</br>   that time, used to sell... How do you say tubos?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The tubes.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Tubes for Pemex, the ones they use to transport everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Petrols, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: They used to sell those big tubes to them. So once the person</br>   came, they stopped everything. They were fine because they knew what's</br>   going to happen, but then he said, &quot;Reforma energetica.&quot; They stopped it</br>   for a really long time more. So they didn't have the money. They weren't</br>   working no more. They didn't have enough money to survive to that. So until</br>   the time right now, they haven't sell anything to Pemex. Pemex is not</br>   buying nothing. That's already what? Six, seven years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So which president are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Peña Nieto.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So this guy comes in, screws everything up for everybody because</br>   we're not the only family. We know families that they were millionaires.</br>   And right now, they don't have a peso. So problems come out on our side. We</br>   don't have money. We have to go live with his parents, and his mom is not</br>   the best person ever. She's a really Mexican woman like, &quot;You have to do</br>   this, this, this.&quot; [Chuckles]. I'm like, &quot;I'm pregnant. How can I explain</br>   to you?&quot; Because I got pregnant again. After two years, I got pregnant. She</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, take that clothes upstairs to hang because I can't, my</br>   knees hurt.” And I was like, “I'm pregnant. I can't carry and go up five</br>   levels of stairs. I can't.&quot; So she would make me do it because I was living</br>   at her house. I had to clean, cook, do everything for everybody since I was</br>   living at their house, and she wouldn't do anything. Then on top of that,</br>   when I used to feel bad like headaches or something like that, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, no. Wake up. Get up. You need to do this.&quot; Like that. I don't</br>   know if I was weak, [Chuckle] if I'm a weak woman or not, or it was too</br>   much what I had to do in that stage, but I ended up losing my baby. I lost</br>   my kidney. I lost both of my kidneys.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I lost my kidneys and so I was sick. I've just been trying to</br>   survive. I don't know if I learned or I just decided not to do more than I</br>   have to, to survive because whenever you try to do the best you can, people</br>   don't think the same way as you. My baby's dad don't think the same way as</br>   me. I don't know if he doesn't want the family that I want or worse. We</br>   don't have the same culture. When I started working, he used to get really</br>   mad. He used to get really jealous. He would be like, &quot;Hey, no. Don't talk</br>   to this person. Don't talk to this person. No, you can't do that.&quot; Then I</br>   got ascended, ascent? Promotion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Promoted.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Promoted. I got promoted at my job, and he got really mad. He was</br>   like, &quot;Why? It's more...&quot; I was like, &quot;It's less time. It's more money,</br>   less time. Think about it.&quot; He was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, are you still together?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. Well, kind of. [Chuckles]. We used to fight a lot. His mom,</br>   even though I was working and giving all my money to our home… So we used</br>   to fight a lot because, even though I was working the whole day, I had to</br>   come back home, cook, clean, and do everything that a Mexican wife should</br>   do. Cook, clean, look after the kid, everything. They would say I would do</br>   nothing. I was sick, and I had to do everything. They didn't work. They</br>   didn't do clean. They wouldn't do anything. They would be attacking me all</br>   the time. His parents, him against me. So I just let it happen. I was just</br>   like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Just do what I have to do for my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you ever think of going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Every single day of my life, I think of going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you might?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. There's more time than life. That's something I want. I just</br>   want, even if it's for a day, just go back, step to United States, look</br>   around, and remember everything that happened to me there. I'll be happy.</br>   I'll be happy because I miss my house. I miss my family. [Emotional]. Even</br>   though I got most of my family here, it's not the same. They don't care</br>   about you. When I needed my kidney transplant, because I need one, and my</br>   mom told my family that if anybody wanted to donate, nobody answered.</br>   Nobody said, &quot;Hey, I can't, but I'll pray for you.&quot; Nobody. They just</br>   changed the topic. When I told my family in the States that I needed a</br>   kidney, my smallest cousin, he's around eighteen, he said, &quot;Hey, I'll give</br>   it to you&quot; right away. It makes me feel like I don't need to see you every</br>   day to be family. You're not my family. My family is in the States. They</br>   are my family. They love me. They care about me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you'd like to go back and live there? Would you still join the</br>   army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I can't. [Chuckles]. If I could, yes. If I could, I would do it</br>   with the eyes closed. I'd be like, &quot;Hey, I'll decide. I'll sell my life.
