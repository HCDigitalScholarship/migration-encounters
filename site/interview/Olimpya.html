 <br>
 <br>
   Olimpya: I was small. I was around five or six years. I was in first grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: You were in first grade?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You grew up in Mexico City or somewhere else?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes, here in—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Here in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My mom used to have a lot of domestic violence problems with my</br>   dad. So normally, we would be leaving the house, and come back, and come</br>   and go. But one day, my uncle, who's an American citizen, came to Mexico</br>   for a vacation. It was in the meantime when we were out of the house. So my</br>   mom saw him. They talked about what was going on, how he can help, and one</br>   day, my mom said, &quot;You know what? We're leaving.&quot; So we grabbed a couple of</br>   clothes, shoes, and we left.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just like that?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. One day to another, we were already on the road. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. We were on the mobile home with my uncle and his family. We</br>   were setting off to Ciudad Juárez. So that's why basically.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As a child, was it scary for you at home?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It was kind of confusing because I was happy because they told me</br>   about Disneyland and all this stuff. I was really happy about that, but</br>   then you look back, and you're like, “My dad, my sisters, my house, my</br>   toys, my things, what's going to happen?&quot; I was happy during the day</br>   because I wouldn't think about it, but at nights, I used to have really bad</br>   dreams about it, about leaving my dad, about everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it was just you who went with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. My two brothers and I.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, somebody stayed behind though? You say your sisters?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Well, I got two more sisters and two more brothers. They're</br>   older. But they're not my mom's. They're my dad's, but we grew up together,</br>   so we're really...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I understand. I understand. So it was really hard to leave all of</br>   this behind.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. But as a kid, you don't think about it. You just, in your</br>   mind, you have it there. You know it's there. I know because, for a whole</br>   year, I used to have really bad dreams where I used to wake up crying. My</br>   mom would be like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; I'm like, &quot;My dad, my dad, my dad.&quot;</br>   She's like, &quot;But it's already a year.&quot; I was like, &quot;I don't know. It just</br>   comes out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember some of the nightmares?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I remember one that it's like really stuck in my mind. It's</br>   really weird. The day we left the house—it's the same house where my dad</br>   lives right now, so it's on the avenue. I remember my mom, she had a truck,</br>   I don't know who give it to her, to take out our stuff. I remember I was</br>   sitting on the back looking like this and seeing my dad. Then I start</br>   crying. That's a dream I can't forget about. I don't know why, but it's</br>   there. [Chuckles]. It's just there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have contact with your dad when you were in the</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but not that much. At the beginning, it was really weird to</br>   talk to him because my mom didn't want him to know that we were over there,</br>   so it was once a month maybe? Then after that, we tried to contact him, but</br>   he was working or with his new family and this lady wouldn't let us talk to</br>   him. Every time I call, she would say, &quot;Ah, he's not here.” I could hear</br>   his voice on the back, so I was like, &quot;I know he's here.&quot; So she wouldn't</br>   let... so things like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: A lot of people have told us about domestic violence. Why do you</br>   think there's so much domestic violence?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me. What do you think? Say more.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, here in Mexico, girls or women, we're raised to serve. We're</br>   not raised to think or do something on our own because it's dangerous for</br>   us. But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.</br>   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that</br>   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's</br>   basically it. And since we're raised by Mexican women. So, me as a woman, I</br>   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all</br>   girls here, they're not the same. They think, &quot;No, you're a girl, you need</br>   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.&quot; Then the daughter-in-law comes,</br>   and then she's like, &quot;No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for</br>   my son.&quot; So it's education basically, ignorance.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you think differently? I know I'm getting ahead of</br>   everything—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, it's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: —but it's interesting. Do you think differently because you grew up</br>   in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird</br>   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.</br>   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if</br>   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll</br>   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really</br>   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,</br>   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,</br>   not because they're forcing me too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you also talk about raising your son differently.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in first grade, so he is about the age when</br>   I left. Last week, he came to me. He's like, &quot;Hey, mom. I need to tell you</br>   something, but you're going to get really mad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. Tell</br>   me.&quot; I thought he did something bad. He's like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; [Laughing].</br>   So, I was just like, &quot;Hold on. I was expecting something else.&quot; So he's</br>   like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get</br>   mad at it.&quot; &quot;Wait, mom. It gets worse.” I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;She's in third</br>   grade.&quot; [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Okay. She's old for him,&quot; but inside</br>   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, &quot;Okay. I'm not going to tell</br>   him ‘No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's</br>   too big.’ No.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.</br>   What's the problem?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah. You like</br>   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.&quot;</br>   So, he looked at me and he's like, &quot;Can I write a letter for her?&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Go ahead.&quot; So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since</br>   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,</br>   respect her. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's wonderful. That's a wonderful story.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So just on that, what's it like to have a son who's the same age as</br>   when you left? Does it bring you back?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot</br>   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in</br>   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it</br>   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would he be doing if he were in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.</br>   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The</br>   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your</br>   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really</br>   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't</br>   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable</br>   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get</br>   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really</br>   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,</br>   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He was born here?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, yeah. When I came back after, I think five, six years, I had</br>   him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, tell me about growing up in the States. What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Growing up in the USA was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was the best</br>   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was</br>   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family</br>   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that</br>   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she</br>   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,</br>   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it</br>   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was</br>   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and</br>   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of jobs did your mom have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Factories. She used to work in factories in morning and then at</br>   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She</br>   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and</br>   come back. It was really hard for her.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but</br>   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived</br>   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a</br>   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't</br>   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I</br>   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like</br>   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].</br>   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give</br>   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You</br>   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,</br>   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I</br>   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I</br>   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all</br>   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would</br>   live there, I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were an American kid.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted</br>   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do</br>   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.</br>   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my</br>   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always</br>   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you</br>   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a</br>   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my</br>   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each</br>   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born</br>   on the same day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the day?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: In June 29.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Soon, you're having a birthday?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on the same</br>   day, and we didn't know it. We were just like, &quot;Huh.&quot; But she used to take</br>   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   come here. I'll teach you something.&quot; So she would pull me a lot to</br>   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone—because my brothers</br>   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing—she would</br>   be like, &quot;Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,&quot; and I would</br>   go with her. She's a Christian, and they got a lot of activities on</br>   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over</br>   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,</br>   &quot;Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her</br>   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see</br>   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that</br>   you can't give her at the moment.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So my mom said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and it was the best decision she ever made</br>   because my aunt, I was her daughter. I'm still her daughter. We call each</br>   other. We talk a lot. She saved my life because I was already starting to</br>   go with the girls. I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I</br>   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that</br>   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?</br>   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to</br>   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you</br>   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in</br>   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just</br>   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was</br>   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down</br>   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or</br>   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight</br>   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody</br>   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bit somebody?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I was like, &quot;What? What are you doing?&quot; So it was really</br>   scary for me, and I didn't like it, but you have to do it because you want</br>   friends. If you don't do it, they're going to do it to you. That's when my</br>   aunt came in, and she's like, &quot;Come with.&quot; She saved that part of me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did you find another group of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, yeah, when I went to live with my aunt, it was a whole</br>   different story because I used to live in ___ California. It's a really</br>   Hispanic town.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,</br>   California. It's a really nice little town and really American. So, when I</br>   got there, I was like, &quot;Hey, I like it here.&quot; [Chuckles]. When I got to</br>   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able</br>   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used</br>   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,</br>   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like</br>   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from</br>   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My aunt would be like, &quot;Why don't you go with the Mexicans or just</br>   one group?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I can learn from everybody. You can learn from</br>   everything.&quot; I like how African Americans talk, and how they act, and how</br>   happy they are. Then you also turn around and look at Americans, and you</br>   see how nice and educated they are. They talk about music. They talk about</br>   really cool things. Then you go with my Korean friends, and they teach me</br>   how to draw. You can learn from their cultures and the way they were raised</br>   just by talking to them. That's amazing for me. That's why I used to like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So I was happy. Then my aunt would be like, &quot;Okay. If you can</br>   speak Korean and understand it, it's your problem.&quot; [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you learn Korean?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying</br>   to learn English because first, so I was like, &quot;Okay, it's hard.&quot; [Laughs].</br>   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak English really</br>   well, so we were like, &quot;Uh.&quot; We make hand signs so it was fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom</br>   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your</br>   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she</br>   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my</br>   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking</br>   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So again—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We start all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All over again.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Around fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that</br>   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had</br>   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I</br>   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,</br>   hey, it's not my house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in America. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the States, house are really big. And</br>   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.</br>   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.</br>   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're</br>   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;</br>   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're</br>   leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she</br>   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an</br>   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was</br>   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.</br>   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.</br>   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me</br>   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going</br>   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.</br>   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show</br>   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I</br>   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and</br>   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems</br>   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent</br>   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.</br>   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this</br>   back in the States. This was third-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but</br>   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I</br>   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many years ago was this? How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I'm twenty-six.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you came back when you were fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, around eleven years, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. How come your English is still so good?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I practice a lot. I used to work in call centers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, but still.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Laughs]. Then I talk to my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, my</br>   brother, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You talk to them in English?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah, we try to keep it in English, so I can still practice.</br>   When I used to work, it was everything in English. So I try to practice a</br>   lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did anything get any better?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, &quot;Okay. If I'm</br>   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can</br>   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.</br>   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying</br>   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't</br>   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The</br>   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They</br>   wouldn't check on you like, &quot;It's your responsibility to come to school,</br>   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.&quot; Basically,</br>   what we used to do in the mornings, we had to be at school at 5:00 AM</br>   because we used to cook in the morning. Then around 7:00—we had, 7:00 to</br>   8:00, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we</br>   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in</br>   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.</br>   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would</br>   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get</br>   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My</br>   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out</br>   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You</br>   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is</br>   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going</br>   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come</br>   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she</br>   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It</br>   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: But then, I met this guy who is my baby's dad. He was from the</br>   best kids there were because you could find worse. He would be like, &quot;No,</br>   go in your classes. Be good. You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;Hey, he's protecting me.&quot; I found somebody to protect me,</br>   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish</br>   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and</br>   I couldn't go to school no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What sickness did you have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't know what it's called in English. It's Trombocitopénica</br>   Púrpura-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thrombosis—thrombosis of something, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. My blood is like water. Be like water. Then if you touch me</br>   like that, even if you go like that, you will see a big... I don't know how</br>   you say moretón. Bruise?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bruise.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I will get a really big bruise even if you go like that. So</br>   I had to stay in bed for a really long time, and I got medicated. I</br>   couldn't go to school. I lost a year. Then I tried to go back, and then I</br>   got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay. This is not for me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when you got pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Nineteen. Yeah, nineteen. Then I got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay.</br>   I'm just going to take care of my son, my family. I just want to have a</br>   family like my aunt's family in the US.&quot; That's what I wanted. I started</br>   working on that. I was really happy at that moment. I was pregnant. I was</br>   going to have my kid. I had my husband. He loved me. Everything was</br>   perfect, but then, this president with his political things came with the</br>   reforma energetica.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, the energy reform.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: And screw everything up for his family and for everything. So—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean? Why did the energy reform—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: This reform, whenever they change presidents, everything in Mexico</br>   is stopped for a really long time, about a year. My boyfriend's family, at</br>   that time, used to sell... How do you say tubos?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The tubes.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Tubes for Pemex, the ones they use to transport everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Petrols, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: They used to sell those big tubes to them. So once the person</br>   came, they stopped everything. They were fine because they knew what's</br>   going to happen, but then he said, &quot;Reforma energetica.&quot; They stopped it</br>   for a really long time more. So they didn't have the money. They weren't</br>   working no more. They didn't have enough money to survive to that. So until</br>   the time right now, they haven't sell anything to Pemex. Pemex is not</br>   buying nothing. That's already what? Six, seven years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So which president are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Peña Nieto.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So this guy comes in, screws everything up for everybody because</br>   we're not the only family. We know families that they were millionaires.</br>   And right now, they don't have a peso. So problems come out on our side. We</br>   don't have money. We have to go live with his parents, and his mom is not</br>   the best person ever. She's a really Mexican woman like, &quot;You have to do</br>   this, this, this.&quot; [Chuckles]. I'm like, &quot;I'm pregnant. How can I explain</br>   to you?&quot; Because I got pregnant again. After two years, I got pregnant. She</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, take that clothes upstairs to hang because I can't, my</br>   knees hurt.” And I was like, “I'm pregnant. I can't carry and go up five</br>   levels of stairs. I can't.&quot; So she would make me do it because I was living</br>   at her house. I had to clean, cook, do everything for everybody since I was</br>   living at their house, and she wouldn't do anything. Then on top of that,</br>   when I used to feel bad like headaches or something like that, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, no. Wake up. Get up. You need to do this.&quot; Like that. I don't</br>   know if I was weak, [Chuckle] if I'm a weak woman or not, or it was too</br>   much what I had to do in that stage, but I ended up losing my baby. I lost</br>   my kidney. I lost both of my kidneys.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I lost my kidneys and so I was sick. I've just been trying to</br>   survive. I don't know if I learned or I just decided not to do more than I</br>   have to, to survive because whenever you try to do the best you can, people</br>   don't think the same way as you. My baby's dad don't think the same way as</br>   me. I don't know if he doesn't want the family that I want or worse. We</br>   don't have the same culture. When I started working, he used to get really</br>   mad. He used to get really jealous. He would be like, &quot;Hey, no. Don't talk</br>   to this person. Don't talk to this person. No, you can't do that.&quot; Then I</br>   got ascended, ascent? Promotion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Promoted.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Promoted. I got promoted at my job, and he got really mad. He was</br>   like, &quot;Why? It's more...&quot; I was like, &quot;It's less time. It's more money,</br>   less time. Think about it.&quot; He was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, are you still together?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. Well, kind of. [Chuckles]. We used to fight a lot. His mom,</br>   even though I was working and giving all my money to our home… So we used</br>   to fight a lot because, even though I was working the whole day, I had to</br>   come back home, cook, clean, and do everything that a Mexican wife should</br>   do. Cook, clean, look after the kid, everything. They would say I would do</br>   nothing. I was sick, and I had to do everything. They didn't work. They</br>   didn't do clean. They wouldn't do anything. They would be attacking me all</br>   the time. His parents, him against me. So I just let it happen. I was just</br>   like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Just do what I have to do for my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you ever think of going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Every single day of my life, I think of going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you might?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="54053952-e9aa-4234-b5e7-a8dc2e485e96" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Family Separation, Illness, Mental Health">Olimpya: Yes. There's more time than life. That's something I want. I just<br>
   want, even if it's for a day, just go back, step to United States, look<br>
   around, and remember everything that happened to me there. I'll be happy.<br>
   I'll be happy because I miss my house. I miss my family. [Emotional]. Even<br>
   though I got most of my family here, it's not the same. They don't care<br>
   about you. When I needed my kidney transplant, because I need one, and my<br>
   mom told my family that if anybody wanted to donate, nobody answered.<br>
   Nobody said, &quot;Hey, I can't, but I'll pray for you.&quot; Nobody. They just<br>
   changed the topic. When I told my family in the States that I needed a<br>
   kidney, my smallest cousin, he's around eighteen, he said, &quot;Hey, I'll give<br>
   it to you&quot; right away. It makes me feel like I don't need to see you every<br>
   day to be family. You're not my family. My family is in the States. They<br>
   are my family. They love me. They care about me.<br>

   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can<br>
   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.<br>
   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying<br>
   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't<br>
   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The<br>
   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They<br>
   wouldn't check on you like, &quot;It's your responsibility to come to school,<br>
   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.&quot; Basically,<br>
   what we used to do in the mornings, we had to be at school at 5:00 AM<br>
   because we used to cook in the morning. Then around 7:00—we had, 7:00 to<br>
   8:00, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we<br>
   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in<br>
   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.<br>
   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would<br>
   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get<br>
   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My<br>
   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out<br>
   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You<br>
   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is<br>
   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going<br>
   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come<br>
   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she<br>
   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It<br>
   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].<br>

   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to<br>
   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit<br>
   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't<br>
   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't<br>
   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,<br>
   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the<br>
   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.<br>
   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're<br>
   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;<br>
   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're<br>
   leaving.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she<br>
   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an<br>
   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was<br>
   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.<br>
   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.<br>
   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me<br>
   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going<br>
   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.<br>
   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show<br>
   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I<br>
   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and<br>
   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems<br>
   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent<br>
   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.<br>
   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this<br>
   back in the States. This was third-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but<br>
   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I<br>
   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—<br>

   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to<br>
   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a<br>
   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that<br>
   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't<br>
   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to<br>
   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like<br>
   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they<br>
   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You<br>
   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I<br>
   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you<br>
   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're<br>
   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.<br>
   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a<br>
   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if<br>
   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so<br>
   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my<br>
   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come<br>
   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it<br>
   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start<br>
   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad<br>
   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't<br>
   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and<br>
   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting<br>
   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and<br>
   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect<br>
   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.<br>

   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for<br>
   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of<br>
   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw<br>
   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;<br>
   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every<br>

   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my<br>

   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to<br>
   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you<br>
   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in<br>
   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just<br>
   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was<br>
   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was<br>
   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down<br>

   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or<br>
   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight<br>

   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I<br>
   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I<br>

So normally, we would be leaving the house, and come back, and come</br>   and go. But one day, my uncle, who's an American citizen, came to Mexico</br>   for a vacation. It was in the meantime when we were out of the house. So my</br>   mom saw him. They talked about what was going on, how he can help, and one</br>   day, my mom said, &quot;You know what? We're leaving.&quot; So we grabbed a couple of</br>   clothes, shoes, and we left.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Just like that?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. One day to another, we were already on the road. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. We were on the mobile home with my uncle and his family. We</br>   were setting off to Ciudad Juárez. So that's why basically.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As a child, was it scary for you at home?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It was kind of confusing because I was happy because they told me</br>   about Disneyland and all this stuff. I was really happy about that, but</br>   then you look back, and you're like, “My dad, my sisters, my house, my</br>   toys, my things, what's going to happen?&quot; I was happy during the day</br>   because I wouldn't think about it, but at nights, I used to have really bad</br>   dreams about it, about leaving my dad, about everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, it was just you who went with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. My two brothers and I.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, somebody stayed behind though? You say your sisters?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Well, I got two more sisters and two more brothers. They're</br>   older. But they're not my mom's. They're my dad's, but we grew up together,</br>   so we're really...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I understand. I understand. So it was really hard to leave all of</br>   this behind.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. But as a kid, you don't think about it. You just, in your</br>   mind, you have it there. You know it's there. I know because, for a whole</br>   year, I used to have really bad dreams where I used to wake up crying. My</br>   mom would be like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; I'm like, &quot;My dad, my dad, my dad.&quot;</br>   She's like, &quot;But it's already a year.&quot; I was like, &quot;I don't know. It just</br>   comes out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you remember some of the nightmares?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I remember one that it's like really stuck in my mind. It's</br>   really weird. The day we left the house—it's the same house where my dad</br>   lives right now, so it's on the avenue. I remember my mom, she had a truck,</br>   I don't know who give it to her, to take out our stuff. I remember I was</br>   sitting on the back looking like this and seeing my dad. Then I start</br>   crying. That's a dream I can't forget about. I don't know why, but it's</br>   there. [Chuckles]. It's just there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have contact with your dad when you were in the</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but not that much. At the beginning, it was really weird to</br>   talk to him because my mom didn't want him to know that we were over there,</br>   so it was once a month maybe?

Why do you</br>   think there's so much domestic violence?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me. What do you think? Say more.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, here in Mexico, girls or women, we're raised to serve. We're</br>   not raised to think or do something on our own because it's dangerous for</br>   us. But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.</br>   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that</br>   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's</br>   basically it. And since we're raised by Mexican women. So, me as a woman, I</br>   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all</br>   girls here, they're not the same. They think, &quot;No, you're a girl, you need</br>   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.&quot; Then the daughter-in-law comes,</br>   and then she's like, &quot;No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for</br>   my son.&quot; So it's education basically, ignorance.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you think differently? I know I'm getting ahead of</br>   everything—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, it's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: —but it's interesting. Do you think differently because you grew up</br>   in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird</br>   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.</br>   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if</br>   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll</br>   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really</br>   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,</br>   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,</br>   not because they're forcing me too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you also talk about raising your son differently.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in first grade, so he is about the age when</br>   I left. Last week, he came to me. He's like, &quot;Hey, mom. I need to tell you</br>   something, but you're going to get really mad.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. Tell</br>   me.&quot; I thought he did something bad. He's like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; [Laughing].</br>   So, I was just like, &quot;Hold on. I was expecting something else.&quot; So he's</br>   like, &quot;I'm in love.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get</br>   mad at it.&quot; &quot;Wait, mom. It gets worse.” I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;She's in third</br>   grade.&quot; [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Okay. She's old for him,&quot; but inside</br>   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, &quot;Okay. I'm not going to tell</br>   him ‘No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's</br>   too big.’ No.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.</br>   What's the problem?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah. You like</br>   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.&quot;</br>   So, he looked at me and he's like, &quot;Can I write a letter for her?&quot; I was</br>   like, &quot;Go ahead.&quot; So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since</br>   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,</br>   respect her. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's wonderful. That's a wonderful story.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So just on that, what's it like to have a son who's the same age as</br>   when you left? Does it bring you back?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot</br>   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in</br>   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it</br>   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would he be doing if he were in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.</br>   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The</br>   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your</br>   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really</br>   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't</br>   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable</br>   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get</br>   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really</br>   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,</br>   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He was born here?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, yeah. When I came back after, I think five, six years, I had</br>   him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, tell me about growing up in the States. What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Growing up in the USA was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was the best</br>   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was</br>   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family</br>   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that</br>   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she</br>   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,</br>   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it</br>   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was</br>   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and</br>   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of jobs did your mom have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Factories. She used to work in factories in morning and then at</br>   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She</br>   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and</br>   come back. It was really hard for her.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but</br>   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived</br>   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a</br>   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't</br>   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I</br>   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like</br>   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].</br>   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give</br>   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You</br>   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,</br>   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I</br>   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I</br>   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all</br>   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would</br>   live there, I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were an American kid.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted</br>   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do</br>   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.</br>   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my</br>   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always</br>   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you</br>   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a</br>   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my</br>   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each</br>   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born</br>   on the same day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the day?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: In June 29.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Soon, you're having a birthday?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on the same</br>   day, and we didn't know it. We were just like, &quot;Huh.&quot; But she used to take</br>   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   come here. I'll teach you something.&quot; So she would pull me a lot to</br>   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone—because my brothers</br>   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing—she would</br>   be like, &quot;Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,&quot; and I would</br>   go with her. She's a Christian, and they got a lot of activities on</br>   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over</br>   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,</br>   &quot;Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her</br>   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see</br>   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that</br>   you can't give her at the moment.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So my mom said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and it was the best decision she ever made</br>   because my aunt, I was her daughter. I'm still her daughter. We call each</br>   other. We talk a lot. She saved my life because I was already starting to</br>   go with the girls. I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I</br>   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that</br>   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?</br>   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to</br>   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you</br>   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in</br>   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just</br>   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was</br>   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down</br>   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or</br>   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight</br>   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody</br>   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bit somebody?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I was like, &quot;What? What are you doing?&quot; So it was really</br>   scary for me, and I didn't like it, but you have to do it because you want</br>   friends. If you don't do it, they're going to do it to you. That's when my</br>   aunt came in, and she's like, &quot;Come with.&quot; She saved that part of me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did you find another group of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, yeah, when I went to live with my aunt, it was a whole</br>   different story because I used to live in ___ California. It's a really</br>   Hispanic town.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,</br>   California. It's a really nice little town and really American. So, when I</br>   got there, I was like, &quot;Hey, I like it here.&quot; [Chuckles]. When I got to</br>   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able</br>   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used</br>   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,</br>   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like</br>   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from</br>   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My aunt would be like, &quot;Why don't you go with the Mexicans or just</br>   one group?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I can learn from everybody. You can learn from</br>   everything.&quot; I like how African Americans talk, and how they act, and how</br>   happy they are. Then you also turn around and look at Americans, and you</br>   see how nice and educated they are. They talk about music. They talk about</br>   really cool things. Then you go with my Korean friends, and they teach me</br>   how to draw. You can learn from their cultures and the way they were raised</br>   just by talking to them. That's amazing for me. That's why I used to like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So I was happy. Then my aunt would be like, &quot;Okay. If you can</br>   speak Korean and understand it, it's your problem.&quot; [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you learn Korean?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying</br>   to learn English because first, so I was like, &quot;Okay, it's hard.&quot; [Laughs].</br>   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak English really</br>   well, so we were like, &quot;Uh.&quot; We make hand signs so it was fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom</br>   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your</br>   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she</br>   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my</br>   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking</br>   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So again—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We start all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All over again.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Around fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that</br>   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had</br>   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I</br>   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,</br>   hey, it's not my house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in America. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the States, house are really big. And</br>   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.</br>   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.</br>   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're</br>   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;</br>   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're</br>   leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she</br>   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an</br>   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was</br>   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.</br>   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.</br>   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me</br>   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going</br>   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.</br>   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show</br>   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I</br>   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and</br>   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems</br>   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent</br>   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.</br>   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this</br>   back in the States. This was third-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but</br>   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I</br>   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many years ago was this? How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I'm twenty-six.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you came back when you were fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, around eleven years, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. How come your English is still so good?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I practice a lot. I used to work in call centers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, but still.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Laughs]. Then I talk to my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, my</br>   brother, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You talk to them in English?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah, we try to keep it in English, so I can still practice.</br>   When I used to work, it was everything in English. So I try to practice a</br>   lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did anything get any better?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, &quot;Okay. If I'm</br>   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can</br>   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.</br>   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying</br>   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't</br>   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The</br>   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They</br>   wouldn't check on you like, &quot;It's your responsibility to come to school,</br>   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.&quot; Basically,</br>   what we used to do in the mornings, we had to be at school at 5:00 AM</br>   because we used to cook in the morning. Then around 7:00—we had, 7:00 to</br>   8:00, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we</br>   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in</br>   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.</br>   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would</br>   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get</br>   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My</br>   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out</br>   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You</br>   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is</br>   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going</br>   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come</br>   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she</br>   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It</br>   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: But then, I met this guy who is my baby's dad. He was from the</br>   best kids there were because you could find worse. He would be like, &quot;No,</br>   go in your classes. Be good. You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;Hey, he's protecting me.&quot; I found somebody to protect me,</br>   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish</br>   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and</br>   I couldn't go to school no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What sickness did you have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't know what it's called in English. It's Trombocitopénica</br>   Púrpura-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thrombosis—thrombosis of something, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. My blood is like water. Be like water. Then if you touch me</br>   like that, even if you go like that, you will see a big... I don't know how</br>   you say moretón. Bruise?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bruise.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I will get a really big bruise even if you go like that. So</br>   I had to stay in bed for a really long time, and I got medicated. I</br>   couldn't go to school. I lost a year. Then I tried to go back, and then I</br>   got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay. This is not for me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when you got pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="09ce897c-01dc-44d9-bea9-1a1358b383c1" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US">Olimpya: Nineteen. Yeah, nineteen. Then I got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay.<br>
   I'm just going to take care of my son, my family. I just want to have a<br>
   family like my aunt's family in the US.&quot; That's what I wanted. I started<br>
   working on that. I was really happy at that moment. I was pregnant. I was<br>
   going to have my kid. I had my husband. He loved me. Everything was<br>
   perfect, but then, this president with his political things came with the<br>
   reforma energetica.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Yeah, the energy reform.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: And screw everything up for his family and for everything. So—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean? Why did the energy reform—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: This reform, whenever they change presidents, everything in Mexico</br>   is stopped for a really long time, about a year. My boyfriend's family, at</br>   that time, used to sell... How do you say tubos?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The tubes.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Tubes for Pemex, the ones they use to transport everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Petrols, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: They used to sell those big tubes to them. So once the person</br>   came, they stopped everything. They were fine because they knew what's</br>   going to happen, but then he said, &quot;Reforma energetica.&quot; They stopped it</br>   for a really long time more. So they didn't have the money. They weren't</br>   working no more. They didn't have enough money to survive to that. So until</br>   the time right now, they haven't sell anything to Pemex. Pemex is not</br>   buying nothing. That's already what? Six, seven years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So which president are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Peña Nieto.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So this guy comes in, screws everything up for everybody because</br>   we're not the only family. We know families that they were millionaires.</br>   And right now, they don't have a peso. So problems come out on our side. We</br>   don't have money. We have to go live with his parents, and his mom is not</br>   the best person ever. She's a really Mexican woman like, &quot;You have to do</br>   this, this, this.&quot; [Chuckles]. I'm like, &quot;I'm pregnant. How can I explain</br>   to you?&quot; Because I got pregnant again. After two years, I got pregnant. She</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, take that clothes upstairs to hang because I can't, my</br>   knees hurt.” And I was like, “I'm pregnant. I can't carry and go up five</br>   levels of stairs. I can't.&quot; So she would make me do it because I was living</br>   at her house. I had to clean, cook, do everything for everybody since I was</br>   living at their house, and she wouldn't do anything. Then on top of that,</br>   when I used to feel bad like headaches or something like that, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, no. Wake up. Get up. You need to do this.&quot; Like that. I don't</br>   know if I was weak, [Chuckle] if I'm a weak woman or not, or it was too</br>   much what I had to do in that stage, but I ended up losing my baby. I lost</br>   my kidney. I lost both of my kidneys.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="c01897d5-d015-46ee-bf1a-1351c6586d7d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Illness">Olimpya: I lost my kidneys and so I was sick. I've just been trying to<br>
   survive. I don't know if I learned or I just decided not to do more than I<br>
   have to, to survive because whenever you try to do the best you can, people<br>
   don't think the same way as you. My baby's dad don't think the same way as<br>
   me. I don't know if he doesn't want the family that I want or worse. We<br>
   don't have the same culture. When I started working, he used to get really<br>
   mad. He used to get really jealous. He would be like, &quot;Hey, no. Don't talk<br>
   to this person. Don't talk to this person. No, you can't do that.&quot; Then I<br>
   got ascended, ascent? Promotion.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Promoted.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Promoted. I got promoted at my job, and he got really mad. He was</br>   like, &quot;Why? It's more...&quot; I was like, &quot;It's less time. It's more money,</br>   less time. Think about it.&quot; He was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, are you still together?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. Well, kind of. [Chuckles]. We used to fight a lot. His mom,</br>   even though I was working and giving all my money to our home… So we used</br>   to fight a lot because, even though I was working the whole day, I had to</br>   come back home, cook, clean, and do everything that a Mexican wife should</br>   do. Cook, clean, look after the kid, everything. They would say I would do</br>   nothing. I was sick, and I had to do everything. They didn't work. They</br>   didn't do clean. They wouldn't do anything. They would be attacking me all</br>   the time. His parents, him against me. So I just let it happen. I was just</br>   like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Just do what I have to do for my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you ever think of going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Every single day of my life, I think of going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you might?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. There's more time than life. That's something I want. I just</br>   want, even if it's for a day, just go back, step to United States, look</br>   around, and remember everything that happened to me there. I'll be happy.</br>   I'll be happy because I miss my house. I miss my family. [Emotional]. Even</br>   though I got most of my family here, it's not the same. They don't care</br>   about you. When I needed my kidney transplant, because I need one, and my</br>   mom told my family that if anybody wanted to donate, nobody answered.</br>   Nobody said, &quot;Hey, I can't, but I'll pray for you.&quot; Nobody. They just</br>   changed the topic. When I told my family in the States that I needed a</br>   kidney, my smallest cousin, he's around eighteen, he said, &quot;Hey, I'll give</br>   it to you&quot; right away. It makes me feel like I don't need to see you every</br>   day to be family. You're not my family. My family is in the States. They</br>   are my family. They love me. They care about me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you'd like to go back and live there? Would you still join the</br>   army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I can't. [Chuckles]. If I could, yes. If I could, I would do it</br>   with the eyes closed. I'd be like, &quot;Hey, I'll decide. I'll sell my life. I</br>   don't care.&quot; If that's going to give my son a better life, I would.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you tell your son about the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="0f0500f4-afe9-46ef-82d8-fcb5ef31c8f8" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being">Olimpya: A lot. He wants to live there too because we go to the parks here.<br>
   There's only one park that we like here in Mexico City. It's really close<br>
   our house because the other ones are really bad. They don't have grass.<br>
   It's like, &quot;You know what grass is, right?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, I want to see<br>

What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in America. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the States, house are really big. And</br>   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.</br>   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.</br>   <span id="c49d3251-52dd-4074-bc05-96cd7052e252" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out">They're doing this.

   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in<br>

   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like<br>
   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].<br>
   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give<br>
   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You<br>
   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,<br>
   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I<br>
   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I<br>
   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all<br>
   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would<br>
   live there, I was happy.<br>

   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived<br>
   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a<br>
   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't<br>
   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.<br>

   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She<br>
   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and<br>
   come back. It was really hard for her.<br>

   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was<br>
   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family<br>
   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that<br>
   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she<br>
   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,<br>
   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it<br>
   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was<br>
   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and<br>
   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.<br>

   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The<br>
   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your<br>
   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really<br>
   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't<br>
   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable<br>
   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get<br>
   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really<br>
   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,<br>
   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.<br>

   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if<br>
   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll<br>
   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really<br>

   Anita: Tell me. What do you think? Say more.<br>

   Olimpya: Well, here in Mexico, girls or women, we're raised to serve. We're<br>
   not raised to think or do something on our own because it's dangerous for<br>
   us. But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.<br>
   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that<br>
   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's<br>
   basically it. And since we're raised by Mexican women. So, me as a woman, I<br>
   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all<br>
   girls here, they're not the same. They think, &quot;No, you're a girl, you need<br>
   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.&quot; Then the daughter-in-law comes,<br>

Does it bring you back?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot</br>   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Hey, I used to do that,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in</br>   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.&quot; Sometimes it</br>   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would he be doing if he were in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.</br>   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The</br>   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your</br>   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really</br>   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't</br>   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable</br>   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get</br>   mad because I'm like, &quot;Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really</br>   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,</br>   and do everything he's going to be able to.&quot; Yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He was born here?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, yeah. When I came back after, I think five, six years, I had</br>   him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, tell me about growing up in the States. What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Growing up in the USA was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was the best</br>   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was</br>   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family</br>   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that</br>   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she</br>   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,</br>   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it</br>   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was</br>   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and</br>   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What kind of jobs did your mom have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Factories. She used to work in factories in morning and then at</br>   afternoon, and then during the night. It was really weird. [Chuckles]. She</br>   used to sleep around one hour a day, one or two hours a day, go work and</br>   come back. It was really hard for her.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, who raised you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but</br>   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived</br>   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a</br>   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't</br>   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How was school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I</br>   remember you—in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like</br>   that—will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].</br>   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give</br>   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You</br>   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,</br>   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I</br>   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I</br>   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all</br>   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would</br>   live there, I was happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were an American kid.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted</br>   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do</br>   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.</br>   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my</br>   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always</br>   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you</br>   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a</br>   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my</br>   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each</br>   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born</br>   on the same day.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's the day?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: In June 29.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Soon, you're having a birthday?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on the same</br>   day, and we didn't know it. We were just like, &quot;Huh.&quot; But she used to take</br>   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, &quot;Oh,</br>   come here. I'll teach you something.&quot; So she would pull me a lot to</br>   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone—because my brothers</br>   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing—she would</br>   be like, &quot;Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,&quot; and I would</br>   go with her. She's a Christian, and they got a lot of activities on</br>   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over</br>   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,</br>   &quot;Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her</br>   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see</br>   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that</br>   you can't give her at the moment.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So my mom said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and it was the best decision she ever made</br>   because my aunt, I was her daughter. I'm still her daughter. We call each</br>   other. We talk a lot. She saved my life because I was already starting to</br>   go with the girls. I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I</br>   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that</br>   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, &quot;Hey, why fight?</br>   We can play. We can do something else.” [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to</br>   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you</br>   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in</br>   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, &quot;I'm just</br>   going to leave.&quot; Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was</br>   like, &quot;Why are you running?&quot; [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was</br>   just like, &quot;Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down</br>   here.&quot; They came. Then they asked me, &quot;What was going on?&quot; I was like,</br>   &quot;They started fighting. I was sitting.&quot; Since they saw I wasn't scratch or</br>   anything, they were like, &quot;Okay. Just go home.&quot; I remember that fight</br>   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody</br>   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bit somebody?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I was like, &quot;What? What are you doing?&quot; So it was really</br>   scary for me, and I didn't like it, but you have to do it because you want</br>   friends. If you don't do it, they're going to do it to you. That's when my</br>   aunt came in, and she's like, &quot;Come with.&quot; She saved that part of me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, did you find another group of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Well, yeah, when I went to live with my aunt, it was a whole</br>   different story because I used to live in ___ California. It's a really</br>   Hispanic town.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,</br>   California. It's a really nice little town and really American. So, when I</br>   got there, I was like, &quot;Hey, I like it here.&quot; [Chuckles]. When I got to</br>   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able</br>   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used</br>   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,</br>   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like</br>   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from</br>   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My aunt would be like, &quot;Why don't you go with the Mexicans or just</br>   one group?&quot; I was like, &quot;No, I can learn from everybody. You can learn from</br>   everything.&quot; I like how African Americans talk, and how they act, and how</br>   happy they are. Then you also turn around and look at Americans, and you</br>   see how nice and educated they are. They talk about music. They talk about</br>   really cool things. Then you go with my Korean friends, and they teach me</br>   how to draw. You can learn from their cultures and the way they were raised</br>   just by talking to them. That's amazing for me. That's why I used to like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So I was happy. Then my aunt would be like, &quot;Okay. If you can</br>   speak Korean and understand it, it's your problem.&quot; [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you learn Korean?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No, I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying</br>   to learn English because first, so I was like, &quot;Okay, it's hard.&quot; [Laughs].</br>   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak English really</br>   well, so we were like, &quot;Uh.&quot; We make hand signs so it was fun. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom</br>   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, &quot;It's your</br>   time, not mine. You can leave.&quot; [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she</br>   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my</br>   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking</br>   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, &quot;We're leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So again—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: We start all over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: All over again.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Around fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that</br>   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had</br>   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I</br>   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,</br>   hey, it's not my house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have dreams of what you were going to do? What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Army.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You wanted to join the army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best</br>   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a</br>   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for</br>   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of</br>   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw</br>   a police, I was like, &quot;Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.&quot;</br>   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, &quot;Hey, you're the best.&quot; Every</br>   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, &quot;Damn. I want</br>   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.&quot; That was my</br>   biggest dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about</br>   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I</br>   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going</br>   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going</br>   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought—nobody asked me</br>   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being</br>   me in America. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you had to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in</br>   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to</br>   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I</br>   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I</br>   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,</br>   the first thing they said was, &quot;Hey, you're dark.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.</br>   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?&quot; They're like, &quot;No, we need to buy</br>   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, I</br>   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?</br>   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].&quot; So, it kind of</br>   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but</br>   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody</br>   said something about my skin color before—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.&quot; They would</br>   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,</br>   &quot;Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.</br>   I don't like you.&quot; They would be like that, and it was starting from my</br>   family, so it hurt. I was like, &quot;How come in a country where I'm not like</br>   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?&quot;</br>   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt</br>   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.&quot; That was the</br>   easiest way for me, but she said, &quot;No, you got to come back with me because</br>   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.&quot;</br>   Like my dad, at the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Hey, but I don't want</br>   to go back with you.&quot; So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my</br>   family. They do that to me, and I was like, &quot;Ugh.&quot; So I started getting mad</br>   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, &quot;Hey, this</br>   thing is really small,&quot; because, in the States, house are really big. And</br>   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, &quot;Hey, where am I</br>   going to live? I need my space.&quot; So I started being really rude. I started</br>   being a bad girl.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Then they said, &quot;Okay. You need to study. You're going back to</br>   school.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?&quot;</br>   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, &quot;Mom, you're not going</br>   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to</br>   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.&quot; It was a</br>   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that</br>   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't</br>   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to</br>   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like</br>   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they</br>   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, &quot;You</br>   don't come from the States.&quot; Like, &quot;Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I</br>   do come from the States. I basically come from there.&quot; Like, &quot;No, you</br>   don't. You're just a Oaxaqueña.&quot; Start calling me names again, &quot;You're</br>   brown. You're short. You're skinny.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.</br>   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a</br>   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if</br>   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so</br>   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my</br>   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come</br>   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, &quot;Okay. Just give it</br>   back.&quot; Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start</br>   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad</br>   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't</br>   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and</br>   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting</br>   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and</br>   this girl started punching me. So I was like, &quot;Hey, I need to protect</br>   myself now.&quot; So I did, and I got expelled because of that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So how did you protect yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I hit her back. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what you watched on the streets, the gangs, you took on the—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I basically... And I was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that</br>   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, &quot;Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to</br>   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.&quot; So I hit</br>   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't</br>   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't</br>   do anything to her. I was like, &quot;I was just defending myself.&quot; It was like,</br>   &quot;I don't care. You did this.&quot; &quot;I did it, but why? You need to look at the</br>   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.</br>   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're</br>   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.&quot;</br>   They didn't care. The principal was like, &quot;No, you're suspended. You're</br>   leaving.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she</br>   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an</br>   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was</br>   like, &quot;It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.</br>   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.</br>   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me</br>   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going</br>   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.</br>   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.&quot; I can show</br>   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I</br>   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and</br>   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems</br>   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent</br>   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.</br>   It would get me frustrated because I was like, &quot;Hey, I already saw this</br>   back in the States. This was third-grade things.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Come on,&quot; but</br>   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I</br>   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many years ago was this? How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I'm twenty-six.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you came back when you were fifteen?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah, around eleven years, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. How come your English is still so good?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I practice a lot. I used to work in call centers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, but still.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. [Laughs]. Then I talk to my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, my</br>   brother, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You talk to them in English?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah, we try to keep it in English, so I can still practice.</br>   When I used to work, it was everything in English. So I try to practice a</br>   lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did anything get any better?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, &quot;Okay. If I'm</br>   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can</br>   leave this place.&quot; [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.</br>   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying</br>   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't</br>   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The</br>   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They</br>   wouldn't check on you like, &quot;It's your responsibility to come to school,</br>   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.&quot; Basically,</br>   what we used to do in the mornings, we had to be at school at 5:00 AM</br>   because we used to cook in the morning. Then around 7:00—we had, 7:00 to</br>   8:00, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we</br>   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in</br>   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.</br>   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would</br>   just be, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get</br>   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My</br>   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, &quot;No, I'm taking you out</br>   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You</br>   already flunk every single class.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, no. Cooking class is</br>   good.&quot; She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, &quot;No, you're going</br>   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come</br>   on.&quot; So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she</br>   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It</br>   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: But then, I met this guy who is my baby's dad. He was from the</br>   best kids there were because you could find worse. He would be like, &quot;No,</br>   go in your classes. Be good. You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;Hey, he's protecting me.&quot; I found somebody to protect me,</br>   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish</br>   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and</br>   I couldn't go to school no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What sickness did you have?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I don't know what it's called in English. It's Trombocitopénica</br>   Púrpura-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Thrombosis—thrombosis of something, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. My blood is like water. Be like water. Then if you touch me</br>   like that, even if you go like that, you will see a big... I don't know how</br>   you say moretón. Bruise?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bruise.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yeah. I will get a really big bruise even if you go like that. So</br>   I had to stay in bed for a really long time, and I got medicated. I</br>   couldn't go to school. I lost a year. Then I tried to go back, and then I</br>   got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay. This is not for me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How old were you when you got pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Nineteen. Yeah, nineteen. Then I got pregnant. I was like, &quot;Okay.</br>   I'm just going to take care of my son, my family. I just want to have a</br>   family like my aunt's family in the US.&quot; That's what I wanted. I started</br>   working on that. I was really happy at that moment. I was pregnant. I was</br>   going to have my kid. I had my husband. He loved me. Everything was</br>   perfect, but then, this president with his political things came with the</br>   reforma energetica.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, the energy reform.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: And screw everything up for his family and for everything. So—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean? Why did the energy reform—</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: This reform, whenever they change presidents, everything in Mexico</br>   is stopped for a really long time, about a year. My boyfriend's family, at</br>   that time, used to sell... How do you say tubos?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: The tubes.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Tubes for Pemex, the ones they use to transport everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Petrols, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: They used to sell those big tubes to them. So once the person</br>   came, they stopped everything. They were fine because they knew what's</br>   going to happen, but then he said, &quot;Reforma energetica.&quot; They stopped it</br>   for a really long time more. So they didn't have the money. They weren't</br>   working no more. They didn't have enough money to survive to that. So until</br>   the time right now, they haven't sell anything to Pemex. Pemex is not</br>   buying nothing. That's already what? Six, seven years ago.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So which president are we talking about?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Peña Nieto.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: So this guy comes in, screws everything up for everybody because</br>   we're not the only family. We know families that they were millionaires.</br>   And right now, they don't have a peso. So problems come out on our side. We</br>   don't have money. We have to go live with his parents, and his mom is not</br>   the best person ever. She's a really Mexican woman like, &quot;You have to do</br>   this, this, this.&quot; [Chuckles]. I'm like, &quot;I'm pregnant. How can I explain</br>   to you?&quot; Because I got pregnant again. After two years, I got pregnant. She</br>   would be like, &quot;Hey, take that clothes upstairs to hang because I can't, my</br>   knees hurt.” And I was like, “I'm pregnant. I can't carry and go up five</br>   levels of stairs. I can't.&quot; So she would make me do it because I was living</br>   at her house. I had to clean, cook, do everything for everybody since I was</br>   living at their house, and she wouldn't do anything. Then on top of that,</br>   when I used to feel bad like headaches or something like that, she would be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, no. Wake up. Get up. You need to do this.&quot; Like that. I don't</br>   know if I was weak, [Chuckle] if I'm a weak woman or not, or it was too</br>   much what I had to do in that stage, but I ended up losing my baby. I lost</br>   my kidney. I lost both of my kidneys.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I lost my kidneys and so I was sick. I've just been trying to</br>   survive. I don't know if I learned or I just decided not to do more than I</br>   have to, to survive because whenever you try to do the best you can, people</br>   don't think the same way as you. My baby's dad don't think the same way as</br>   me. I don't know if he doesn't want the family that I want or worse. We</br>   don't have the same culture. When I started working, he used to get really</br>   mad. He used to get really jealous. He would be like, &quot;Hey, no. Don't talk</br>   to this person. Don't talk to this person. No, you can't do that.&quot; Then I</br>   got ascended, ascent? Promotion.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Promoted.</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Promoted. I got promoted at my job, and he got really mad. He was</br>   like, &quot;Why? It's more...&quot; I was like, &quot;It's less time. It's more money,</br>   less time. Think about it.&quot; He was mad.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, are you still together?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: No. Well, kind of. [Chuckles]. We used to fight a lot. His mom,</br>   even though I was working and giving all my money to our home… So we used</br>   to fight a lot because, even though I was working the whole day, I had to</br>   come back home, cook, clean, and do everything that a Mexican wife should</br>   do. Cook, clean, look after the kid, everything. They would say I would do</br>   nothing. I was sick, and I had to do everything. They didn't work. They</br>   didn't do clean. They wouldn't do anything. They would be attacking me all</br>   the time. His parents, him against me. So I just let it happen. I was just</br>   like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Just do what I have to do for my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, do you ever think of going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Every single day of my life, I think of going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think you might?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: Yes. There's more time than life. That's something I want. I just</br>   want, even if it's for a day, just go back, step to United States, look</br>   around, and remember everything that happened to me there. I'll be happy.</br>   I'll be happy because I miss my house. I miss my family. [Emotional]. Even</br>   though I got most of my family here, it's not the same. They don't care</br>   about you. When I needed my kidney transplant, because I need one, and my</br>   mom told my family that if anybody wanted to donate, nobody answered.</br>   Nobody said, &quot;Hey, I can't, but I'll pray for you.&quot; Nobody. They just</br>   changed the topic. When I told my family in the States that I needed a</br>   kidney, my smallest cousin, he's around eighteen, he said, &quot;Hey, I'll give</br>   it to you&quot; right away. It makes me feel like I don't need to see you every</br>   day to be family. You're not my family. My family is in the States. They</br>   are my family. They love me. They care about me.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you'd like to go back and live there? Would you still join the</br>   army?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: I can't. [Chuckles]. If I could, yes. If I could, I would do it</br>   with the eyes closed. I'd be like, &quot;Hey, I'll decide. I'll sell my life. I</br>   don't care.&quot; If that's going to give my son a better life, I would.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you tell your son about the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Olimpya: A lot. He wants to live there too because we go to the parks here.</br>   There's only one park that we like here in Mexico City. It's really close</br>   our house because the other ones are really bad. They don't have grass.</br>   It's like, &quot;You know what grass is, right?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, I want to see</br>   grass, Mommy. I want to see grass.&quot; [Laughing]. I'm like, &quot;Okay. Let's go</br>   find a park with grass,&quot; because they don't have grass. The playground is</br>   destroyed. It's bad.</br> </div><\p></p>
