I don't know it.&quot; I only play</br> grandpa music.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: But it's grandpa American music?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: It's American music history and if it wasn't for that there wouldn't</br> be a lot of genres today. I really like that old stuff, for sure.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: And how did you get exposed to that old stuff?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, that was in North Carolina. I was actually going through a</br> really big depression. I didn't know what to do anymore, being illegal in</br> the U.S, not being able to find jobs, not being able to go into college was</br> difficult for me so I was falling into a depression. And then I came across</br> this guy called Robert Johnson. Robert Johnson is the king of the Delta</br> blues. He's one of the most important American musicians, ever.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, I started listening to his music and just the pain and the story</br> of him uplifted me. He was letting me know, &quot;You know what, you're healthy.</br> You're young. Look at these African American people back in the day, what</br> they went through and compared to what you're going through? Don't be a</br> sissy and don't complain.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So that music just uplifted me, and it gave me energy and it let me</br> know, &quot;Bro, you don't have to just be this kid with”—because I had a lot of</br> anxiety—&quot;This kid with anxiety. You can play music and make people feel</br> good.&quot; And so that helped me out a lot and eventually that led me to, and</br> this is going to sound weird but, it led me to discover the purpose of what</br> a human is because, listen to this, when you play music, you're helping</br> other people out, right? And you're really contributing to the change that</br> you want to live in the future.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And I was, like, &quot;Dude, what's the purpose of a human being? Why are</br> we here?&quot; And it's simply to help others. That's all it is. It is to</br> contribute to the change you want to live in and it's very fulfilling when</br> you help somebody. And so that let me know, &quot;Dude, you're here to help</br> others and, yeah, just do it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And jazz helped me discover that because it's like a chain. African</br> American people help each other out through their music, that helped other</br> people out, that helped me out. Eventually I took my friend out of a heroin</br> addiction because of that, because of the music. And I started crying when</br> he told me. He was like, &quot;Dude, I just wanted to thank you because you took</br> me out of my heroin addiction.&quot; I actually did something. So that music was</br> really important for me. It gave me an identity.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you were attracted to African American blues and jazz?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, because my brother was listening to it and so I'm like, &quot;Dude,</br> what are you listening to? This is weird We usually listen to rock.&quot; He's</br> like, &quot;Man, this is called blues, bro. This is a really cool music, and it</br> has to do with African American people back in the day and it tells the</br> story of America.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, I just looked into it and I became obsessed with it. I couldn't</br> stop. Once I discovered Louis Armstrong, that was just it. I could not stop</br> playing jazz and so yeah, in North Carolina, I was just feeling kinda</br> crappy and that music came at the perfect time.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Do you think that you identified at all, as an undocumented Mexican</br> living in the U.S., with what the African Americans went through?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I think that I identified with it because when you're feeling at</br> your lowest point, and that's how these people were feeling, going through</br> all the racism and being judged by your color and through all this crap,</br> they were able to create gold, like a piece of gold. So, I was like, &quot;Man,</br> you are at your lowest point, but you could still do something if you want.</br> You can become somebody if you want. Just like these guys created this</br> amazing genre, you can be somebody if you really want.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And so, it just gave me faith. I had low self-esteem. That uplifted</br> me and then I started playing guitar and got more girls in—just kidding,</br> just kidding [Anita laughs]. But, yes—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: It helped, probably [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: It helped a little bit, yeah [Anita laughs]. But it just came at the</br> perfect time, man. Honestly.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I was 21 when I started playing music. Prior to that I didn't know</br> how to play one note on the guitar.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Seriously?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Seriously, dude. And I would love to show you, not right now but</br> when you have time, a video of me playing and it's just... I'm not trying</br> to sound cocky but I'm very proud of that progress. Yeah. And you know it's</br> funny because my dad will be like, &quot;Dude, if you learn one whole song, if</br> you learn one whole Blues song, I'll give you $100.&quot; So, me being young and</br> money hungry I would stay up all night learning these songs and then in the</br> morning he would give me the money. So that also was a motivation like,</br> &quot;Dude, I'm just going to get this money.&quot; I would learn the songs and</br> stayed up all night like, &quot;Dad, I can play now.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Man, all</br> right. Here's the money.&quot; So, that was pretty cool.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, your dad was a musician. As a musician he must've been pretty</br> proud of you wanting to do that?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, he was really happy that I got into it but, for me, I would go</br> a little harder, he would offer me money, which was not necessary, but in a</br> way it was like, &quot;Dude, I want to just show my dad that I can play music</br> well. I can be like him in a way.&quot; So, yes, he motivated me a little bit.</br> And then he said I was better than him. After a year of playing he was</br> like, &quot;Dude, you're better than me now.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Did you ever play with him?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yes, I would play sometimes. A rhythm like “[Singing 00:06:32] Doo</br> doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo” and he would just do the</br> “[Singing] dein neih neihn.”We would play sometimes but yeah, when he saw</br> that I got into it he supported that, for sure.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, this Billy, is that really your name or is that musical name?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That's really my name. Everybody asks me that like, &quot;Dude, is your</br> real name Billy or is it William?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Or Guillermo, exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And it's really Billy… o Guillermo, exactly. But he named me after</br> Billy the Kid, which, he was a killer and a robber, but it's a very</br> important part of American history. It tells the story of the old West and</br> how the U.S. was before the industrial era. I think Billy the Kid's story</br> is pretty cool. He was not a good guy—but maybe he was, just in the wrong</br> time [Anita laughs]. But it's a very important story. You have to know</br> about that. So, yes, he named me after Billy the Kid, man. It's weird.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: But was he in the States already? How did he know about Billy the</br> Kid?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I don't know. Oh, because he used to watch Westerns with his dad in</br> Mexico. The black and white ones. Yeah, so he liked Billy the Kid and</br> stuff. He was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to name my kid Billy.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Wow and the Jack?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Billy... I have no idea where that came from. Maybe he just wanted</br> me to have a white name or something [Anita laughs]. I don't know why they</br> named me Billy my brother's name is Miguel ___. And—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, Miguel ___ and Billy?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, it's odd. You know what I think it was? He just saw I had</br> green eyes or something and he was like, &quot;No, I'm going to give this guy a</br> white name&quot; [Anita laughs]. I don't know. Something dumb like that. But</br> Billy is my name and a lot of people here are like, &quot;I've never met</br> somebody named Billy.&quot; Because it's not common in Mexico, that name. In the</br> U.S. it is.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: But it's weird because when I'm 50 years old you can't keep calling</br> me Billy. It sounds like a little kid name. You have to call me Bill or</br> something. And yeah, it just has to do with the Westerns. He really loves</br> Westerns, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: I just want to ask you one more question and then we move back.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I'm sorry if I'm—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: No, no, no. This is super cool. So, you said you fell into a</br> depression at a certain point. Tell me a little bit about that and then</br> we'll move back.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, so basically, I struggle with OCD, right? I'm sure you know</br> what that is. It's a double-edged sword, it's helped me out of a lot of</br> things to be more consistent. For example, if I'm doing a skateboarding</br> trick, if I land like this, I have to keep doing it over—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Are you a skateboarder too?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, I have a lot of videos on YouTube. Dude, I was sponsored by a</br> skateboarding company called VIP.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Bro, I think about my life sometimes it's like dude I almost forget</br> that I had a skateboarding career. That's crazy to me. But yeah, if I would</br> not land correctly, I would have to do it over until I landed in the middle</br> of the board. And so, I would do that 10 times and then I would feel good.</br> So that helped me to be more consistent but, at the same time, it does</br> cause anxiety and stuff like that. It's a double-edged sword.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Anyways, I was struggling with OCD, I was like, &quot;Man, you're just a</br> freaking kid with OCD, dude. You're not going to do anything in life.&quot; And</br> I started playing these Robert Johnson songs and my dad sees it. He's like,</br> &quot;You know what, man? I'm going to try and motivate this guy so he can get</br> more into it.&quot; So, he would talk to me, he offered me money. And so, I</br> started getting into these songs and I started feeling more spirit. More</br> enthusiasm. I'm like, &quot;Wow, dude, you don't just have to be this weird kid,</br> you can be a jazz musician. You could be something if you want to.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And so, I just started playing and playing it and then that dude</br> just took my depression away, honestly. And now I have OCD, but I don't</br> even care. I know how to cope with it, and I know how to work around it.</br> So, it really gave me an identity, which was really important. I think I</br> was going through an identity crisis.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you said, though, that it was also difficult being undocumented</br> and that that contributed to—</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That pretty much affected my whole life in the U.S. Being somebody</br> that spoke perfect English, and I had a lot of good characteristics, but</br> just wasn't accepted because of the legal information. Funny story, though,</br> one day I was skateboarding on private property. Police came and they</br> arrested me. Because me and my friends, we hopped this fence. It was</br> basically a school and it had a perfect hill. It looked like a skate park</br> almost. So, me and my friends were like, &quot;Dude, we have to skate this.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Anyway, we started filming. Police comes and they arrest us and so</br> they take my friends' information and whatever and they look for me in the</br> system and they can't find me. They were like, &quot;Mr. S__, we can't find you</br> in the system. Where were you born? This doesn't make any sense.&quot; So, I'm</br> like, &quot;Bro, this is it, this is it. I'm going to Mexico.&quot; They were like,</br> &quot;Are you native American, sir?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, sure. I'm native</br> American.&quot; “Okay, well, that's fine. You're free to go, sir, don't worry</br> about it.” So, that saved my butt. The English and the way I looked saved</br> my butt a lot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: And your name.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And the name, too, probably had something to do with it, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: The Jack was a good idea.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That's crazy, really. But yeah, we were skateboarding and yeah, that</br> helped me out a little bit. But what was the question?</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: I was asking about you said you felt depressed and I so you talked</br> about the OCD but, being undocumented, you said you started—</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Oh yeah, exactly. Being undocumented, it really affects your whole</br> life because you can't go into college, you can't get good jobs. It's hard</br> to get a driver's license. You know what I'm saying? So, it really affected</br> the quality of my life, I would say. And so that would be a yes, being</br> undocumented does affect you.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. What I'm trying to figure out is, is there a certain stage of</br> your life where all of a sudden you realized that it was different for you?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Oh yeah, for sure. For sure. When my dad started telling me, &quot;Bro,</br> if you get arrested, you're going to get deported,&quot; and when he started</br> telling me, &quot;If you don't finish school, you're not going to do anything.</br> You're going to be the illegal migrant working construction.&quot; And so, when</br> I started, I was like, &quot;Oh man, this means that I'm like them.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I am a Mexican right? And so, it's like, &quot;Dude, you're American but</br> you're not? This was crazy!” and so right there I was like, &quot;Dude, what am</br> I?&quot; At one point I was like, &quot;Dude, what am I? Am I...?&quot; Not in terms of</br> who I am, in personality, but my nationality. I was like, &quot;Am I American or</br> am I Mexican?&quot; Eventually I just said I was Mexican. That's my nationality,</br> that's where I was born but I had an experience in the U.S. you hear me?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, it's just like, because people are like, &quot;Bro, are you white?&quot;</br> I don't like saying I'm white because I'm not white. It's like, &quot;I'm not</br> white, Bro, I'm Mexican.&quot; They're like, &quot;How are you Mexican, man? How do</br> you speak English like that?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yeah, man. I'm Mexican. It's</br> cool, bro, it's cool.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you said you were Mexican. Why did you say you were Mexican?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Just because I couldn't say I was white. What am I going to say? I'm</br> white? No, I'm Mexican. But at first, I thought I was white. I was like,</br> &quot;Dude, you're just a skater kid. You're American.&quot; Then after I started...</br> My dad told me, &quot;Dude, if you get arrested, that's going to be an issue.&quot;</br> That's when I realized, &quot;Bro, you're Mexican, dude, and this is part of</br> you. This is part of your roots. Just be proud of it. Grab it and be proud</br> of it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So now I'm proud to be Mexican and it's awesome because when a white</br> guy thinks I'm white and I start speaking Spanish he's like, &quot;Whoa man, I</br> didn't know Mexicans could do all that.&quot; And it's like, &quot;Yeah, bro. Yeah,</br> man. I'm here to show that. I'm an example.&quot; So now I'm even more proud of</br> being Mexican.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, at what age do you remember that? What age did your father tell</br> you these things?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Oh, he started telling me this when I was 15.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: 15?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, when he started seeing that I was going out into the streets</br> more and hanging out with my friends he was like, &quot;Dude, be careful with</br> the law. Don't get arrested.&quot; But yeah, I think it's a good thing because</br> I'm an example that Mexicans are not just people that listen to reggaetón</br> and they like to drink. There's people like me. Oh, but you should meet my</br> brother. My brother's a... he reads philosophy all day. It's all he does is</br> read philosophy. Super smart guy. Super cool and yeah, he's very proud of</br> his Mexican culture. He even buys the Mexican shirts.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What the Mexican soccer jerseys or?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No, no, no. He buys the handmade shirts in Oaxaca that have the</br> designs and stuff. They're pretty expensive but he kills that standard.</br> Honestly.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. Where does he live?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: He lives here in ___ He got deported. That's the reason that I'm</br> here because me and my brother are one. We cannot be separated. It was</br> either he goes back to the U.S., which was not going to happen, or I go to</br> Mexico. That's the decision I made.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you came back with him?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No, I came back for him. He basically got deported. I'm going to</br> tell you the story. This is crazy. So my brother goes—he has a really good</br> job, he was getting paid $1,500 a week—goes out into this bar—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What did he do?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: He works in construction. He works on framing and they pay a lot for</br> that. So anyways. He goes down to a bar and he drinks-</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Like framing pictures?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No, framing as in the houses. You frame your house, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Oh, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Like the skeleton of a house.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Got it.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, he goes into this restaurant and he drinks a little bit. Then in</br> come these soldiers, U.S. soldiers, come into the restaurant.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, so they come in, they sit down and then they get into a</br> political discussion. That's already the first error. My brother, he starts</br> talking about the corruption dude and just about the government bro and</br> he's saying this to these U.S. soldiers.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: About the corruption?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yes, in the U.S. of course. So, the soldiers, I don't know what</br> happened, I think it got heated, the argument, and they called the police,</br> not to arrest anybody just to get the information out of them. Just to get</br> the story. Okay? Yes, so they come, and they start talking, &quot;Oh yeah, it</br> was just a political discussion that got a little heated.&quot; They get the</br> soldiers' names, they leave, they look for my brother and they can't find</br> him. They were like, &quot;Sir, we can't find you in the system.&quot; [Claps]</br> Deported.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Dude, a guy that's been in the U.S. his whole life just goes back to</br> Mexico like that. It actually made me cry when I saw his first photo that</br> he posted on Facebook. Him in Mexico. You could see that he's already been</br> burnt by the sun and he's wearing these Mexican clothes. I'm like, &quot;Damn,</br> my brother's in Mexico.&quot; That was tough for me, honestly.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Did he use to wear that stuff in the U.S. too?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No, I'm saying seeing him with these cheaper clothes. You've seen</br> him with these, because here in Mexico they wear... It's not like over</br> there. Over there it's easier to get quality. Over here it's a luxury. You</br> know what I mean? So, I'm like, &quot;Damn, this dude is already... he looks</br> Mexican, dude.&quot; It was crazy for me. And so, I'm like, &quot;Man, I can't leave</br> my brother there. I'm going to go back.&quot; So, I saved them 200 bucks and I</br> just took a plane here.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah. There's another reason as to why I came. I'm just going to go</br> ahead and tell it. This is very personal, but I don't care. So, my dad, he</br> started getting involved with another woman. This white girl. She had a</br> farm. She was more like a country girl. She was all about the country life.</br> So, my dad got involved with her and we ended up moving to a farm with her</br> and I was on the farm with them. It was awesome, to be honest, I had my own</br> little go-cart and I was working with horses. Had my own room.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: But then I would see them kissing and I would see them hugging and</br> that was just too much for me bro. It was too much knowing that my mom was</br> here in Mexico, busting her ass, and my dad is doing that. I'm like, &quot;Bro,</br> you're tripping, dude, doing this in front of me, man.&quot; I just felt</br> disrespected. I'm like, &quot;You know I love you, dad, but you're not very</br> considerate.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, I just got the money, I'm like, &quot;I'm just going to leave. It's</br> better that I don't see this because I'm going to end up getting stressed</br> out and pissed off.” So, I'm like, &quot;I'm just going to go to Mexico. I'm</br> going to be happy with my family, eating good food and save myself some</br> stress.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Does your mom know about your dad?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, she knows about that. She doesn't really say anything because</br> they give her money. My dad sends her money. But it's just sad and I feel</br> bad for her. A woman that devoted herself, all herself, all of her life to</br> this guy. It's like, &quot;Think about this, bro, you wasted your whole life, in</br> a way.&quot; I don't know. So yeah, that got me mad and that was just another</br> reason for me to come.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, she never went to the U.S.?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: She went to the U.S. and when they deported my brother, she didn't</br> want to leave him here by himself. So, she was like, &quot;Man, I got to go with</br> my baby. I have to go look after him.&quot; So, boom. Both of them leave. I'm</br> stuck there with my dad, on this farm, with this new woman. You know what</br> I'm saying?</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: But was your dad with the new woman while he was still with your</br> mom? Did they split up?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, but she discovered him because she snuck in his car and he was</br> driving to the farm like it's all good. And he pulls up to the farm and my</br> mom just hops out the back seat.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Oh my god.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah. She's like, &quot;What the hell are you doing, man? I knew you were</br> doing something.&quot; But it's weird. The lady, the white lady, actually calmed</br> my mom down and my mom ended up liking her. It was weird. So yeah, that was</br> strange. She ended up calming her down, sat her down, like, &quot;Relax. Don't</br> scream, don't get mad.&quot; It's just ironic because you have these three</br> people in the same room. It's just crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Either way, I think my mom understood that it wasn't her fault. She</br> didn't know anything about that and so that's probably why she didn't get</br> mad. But yeah, my mom knew while she was in the U.S.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: For how long was that going on before—</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That was going on for three months before my mom found out.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: And now...?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Now my mom just doesn't give a crap and she sits here in Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Has she found someone here?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No. She's not even trying to date. Like I'm trying to tell you, she</br> gave her whole self and her whole personality to him. It's almost like</br> there is no other man for her. Super strange. And even today she talks good</br> about him. But here's the positive thing, they have talked to each other.</br> They're on the same page now. She forgave him. He feels bad for what he</br> did. And he broke up with the white woman.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: He did?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, he broke up with her.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Oh right. And he's going to come back?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And he's going to come back and supposedly, they're going to be</br> together when he comes back. They're going to reunite. My dad told me, and</br> he told me this in secret, he was like, &quot;Look man, the reason why I'm doing</br> this is because right now this woman is helping me out.&quot; She bought him a</br> car. I swear to god. This is so weird, bro. She literally went to the car</br> dealership, not even in payments, bro, just bought a car. $30,000 and just</br> gave it to my dad.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: She was that wealthy.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: She was a millionaire.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, her husband, his name was Jack. Died of alcoholism but he was</br> very wealthy. He died and left her, bro, left her so much property, so much</br> money, so many things. And she ended up falling in love with my dad because</br> of the music. And when my dad got in a car crash—I forgot to tell you</br> this—that's the reason she bought the car was so he could go to work. And</br> so, she's a nice lady, bro. She's not mean at all, dude. She saw, &quot;Okay</br> this guy has a family to support. Can't get to work. I'm going to buy him a</br> car. Okay, this guy right now doesn't have anywhere to go, he can stay at</br> my place.&quot; So super nice lady and I don't have anything against her. It was</br> just... it was my dad. He was inconsiderate. But he's not a bad guy. How is</br> he a bad guy when he's been supporting two families for 18 years? He's the</br> nicest guy ever.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Two families?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Two families. Yeah, I'll just go ahead and tell you. So, my dad... I</br> have step-siblings. I have Alejandro, there's Miranda and Brenda. Brenda</br> died. She went to the U.S. and she died when she was 21 years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What'd she die of?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: She fell out of a building. Yes, it's crazy. It's not even like,</br> &quot;That's crazy-&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: An accident?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: It was an accident, yeah. Well, she was hanging, and she was with</br> her boyfriend, &quot;You don't love me I'm going to let go.&quot; She was playing.</br> Her arms couldn't lift up no more and so she just let go, man. She was only</br> there for three years.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, my dad is the nicest guy ever and I don't blame him for anything</br> he's done. If he decided to get involved with this white woman maybe it was</br> for a reason. Maybe it was so that we don't end up on the street. You never</br> know. And at the same time, he's a man. Maybe he got bored. Maybe he was</br> feeling lonely. Needed a companion, you know what I'm saying? And so, Norma</br> came up—that's her name, Norma—and he felt good. I don't blame him and I'm</br> nobody to judge him.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So yeah, that's another reason why I came back.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. You're so American.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: You know what? I am American but I'm also very Mexican. If you hear</br> me talking Spanish, I'm very like, from the city and got not much—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: You can do it?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah. I'm a Mexican boy dude.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, I'm going to ask you both these questions. In what way do you</br> feel American?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: The fact that I understand the culture. The fact that I grew up in</br> African American neighborhoods and lived the whole American experience. Not</br> just that but I had friends from all over. Friends from Cuba, living in</br> Miami. From Columbia. Then I had Asian friends, white friends, black</br> friends. I got into the skateboarding culture which really introduced me to</br> a big part of American life. Going out and filming with your friends.</br> Learning jazz music showed me the history of the U.S. and why African</br> American history is so important—it really, in a way, shaped what the U.S.</br> is.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And so, in those ways I consider myself American. Just those</br> experiences. But blood-wise, I'm Mexicano [Anita laughs]. Culturally and in</br> terms of my roots I'm Mexican. I've been exposed to the tacos al pastor. I</br> would give my friends Agua de Jamaica in the U.S. and they were like, &quot;Man,</br> what is this, bro? Man, what is this juice?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Bro, this is not</br> juice it's a plant.&quot; It's like, &quot;Man, this is good, bro. I got to buy</br> this.&quot; And stuff like that. I've been exposed to the Mexican culture, yeah.</br> And, of course, living in LA, Mexican culture's everywhere there. Think of</br> it.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. You spoke Spanish at home?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I had to speak Spanish because my mom doesn't speak English. So, in</br> order to communicate with my mom, right, I had to speak Spanish.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you're completely fluent?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Completely fluent in Spanish. Another thing that I forgot to</br> mention, my mom's from Nicaragua. So, I'm half Nicaraguan and I lived in</br> Nicaragua for two years with my grandma. She had me locked up in a cage..</br> But my grandma is very overprotective, and she would have me... because the</br> houses have cages and so I would be behind this cage all day. She didn't</br> want to let me go outside. Very overprotective. But I lived in Nicaragua</br> and I got exposed to that culture. They're very simple people and very</br> poor.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. Do you miss anything about the States?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I miss speaking English with people. Because when I'm speaking</br> Spanish a lot of times, I'm trying to express a certain idea, but I don't</br> know how to use certain words. So let's say that I'm telling this guy, &quot;Oh</br> dude, that was a great experience.&quot; I don't know how to say 'experience' in</br> Spanish. It's like, “Oh esa fue una experiencia muy buena” It's just things</br> like that. And so yeah, just being able to speak very quickly in English</br> and express myself better. That's what I miss. Here I have to tell them in</br> Spanish “oh está aquí por la carretera y me fue algo muy excelente” and I</br> have to think when I'm speaking. And so, there's pauses and stuff. That</br> never happened to me before.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Did you face discrimination at all in the States?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Let me think about that. No, never. Never.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What about here?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That's something that I always thought about like, &quot;Dude, I never</br> went through racism in the U.S., but I saw my brother go through it, so I</br> understood it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Was your brother... what is it your brother-</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: My brother, he looks like me, you get me? He has the nose, speaks</br> like me, he has the characteristics but he's darker and he has brown eyes.</br> And I remember my friends would play around, &quot;Oh, Mexican. Or we're going</br> to go back to LA man,&quot; and they would mock him. They never did that to me.</br> And, as a matter of fact, this one white guy, he was like, &quot;Man to me</br> you're white, bud. To me you're white, bud.&quot; So, I never went through that.</br> I don't know why.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, did African Americans discriminate against you?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Especially them, they're not going to discriminate. They go through</br> that every day. So, they're not going to do that. But they would be like,</br> &quot;Dude, I know you ain't fully white, you got black in you, don't you? You</br> got black, huh?&quot; I'm going like, &quot;Yeah, man I got black, bro, I got black.&quot;</br> And then I would sing the blues so they would be like, &quot;Yeah man, you got</br> black, man, for sure.” [Anita laughs]. You're like, “[Singing] She don't</br> even want it maybe,&quot; that type of music and so they feel it bro, they</br> really feel it.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Man, I'm going to tell you something. One day I was playing the</br> blues, I was like, “[Singing] Dun dun dun dun dun dn…I got a kindhearted</br> woman.” Then my friends starts rapping out of nowhere. He's like,</br> “[Singing] Yeah man you know I've got a kindhearted woman, she'd shine up</br> at him,” and just started rapping and he really felt that music. So,</br> African Americans were never racist with me and they actually thought that</br> I had black in me. They're like, &quot;Man, you're skinny, bro, but I don't</br> know, man, you don't look white. White people look different. Man, you've</br> got to have something in you, bro.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Dude, I have Nicaraguan in</br> me. And Mexican.&quot; So, they'd talk about that.</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="00817e93-546e-4895-bf9b-7970a034f579" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Favorite, Sports,  baseball Red Sox">Anita: What about sports? Were you a sports fan?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Since I was nine years old, I was involved with sports. I was<br>
 playing basketball and stuff. They put me in soccer, but I couldn't do it<br>
 because people were kicking me in my shins [Anita laughs]. But horrible,<br>
 man. My dad put me in this little Mexican team. It wasn't like the American<br>
 soccer mom team. It was like a Mexican team and my fellow players they<br>
 would kick me in the shin man [Makes kicking noises]. After two weeks I was<br>
 like, &quot;Dad, I can't do this no more, please. Can't do it.” [Anita laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: So you started doing what? What did you do instead?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: After that I started skateboarding. I got a skateboard and I did<br>
 that for 12 years of my life. Every day for 12 years of my life. And I<br>
 actually took that somewhere so that was pretty cool.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: Were you a fan of sports teams?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: The Red Sox. I always like the Red Sox. Not because of—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: The Red Sox?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Yeah. And you know what? It has to do with the historicity of it.<br>
 They were the first baseball team in the U.S. They have so much history.<br>
 When you look at the old pictures, they have the big mustaches and the<br>
 baseball bats. It just looks crazy and so I really like the history of it.<br>
 And even just back in the '20s when they first started filming baseball and<br>
 stuff. So, I just like the history of the Red Sox, but I don't watch it<br>
 every Saturday.<br>

 ahead and tell it. This is very personal, but I don't care. So, my dad, he<br>
 started getting involved with another woman. This white girl. She had a<br>
 farm. She was more like a country girl. She was all about the country life.<br>
 So, my dad got involved with her and we ended up moving to a farm with her<br>
 and I was on the farm with them. It was awesome, to be honest, I had my own<br>
 little go-cart and I was working with horses. Had my own room.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: But then I would see them kissing and I would see them hugging and<br>
 that was just too much for me bro. It was too much knowing that my mom was<br>
 here in Mexico, busting her ass, and my dad is doing that. I'm like, &quot;Bro,<br>
 you're tripping, dude, doing this in front of me, man.&quot; I just felt<br>
 disrespected. I'm like, &quot;You know I love you, dad, but you're not very<br>
 considerate.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: So, I just got the money, I'm like, &quot;I'm just going to leave. It's<br>
 better that I don't see this because I'm going to end up getting stressed<br>
 out and pissed off.” So, I'm like, &quot;I'm just going to go to Mexico. I'm<br>

 burnt by the sun and he's wearing these Mexican clothes. I'm like, &quot;Damn,<br>
 my brother's in Mexico.&quot; That was tough for me, honestly.<br>
      <br>

 Anita: Did he use to wear that stuff in the U.S. too?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: No, I'm saying seeing him with these cheaper clothes. You've seen<br>
 him with these, because here in Mexico they wear... It's not like over<br>
 there. Over there it's easier to get quality. Over here it's a luxury. You<br>
 know what I mean? So, I'm like, &quot;Damn, this dude is already... he looks<br>
 Mexican, dude.&quot; It was crazy for me. And so, I'm like, &quot;Man, I can't leave<br>

 talking about the corruption dude and just about the government bro and<br>
 he's saying this to these U.S. soldiers.<br>

 Billy: Yes, in the U.S. of course. So, the soldiers, I don't know what<br>
 happened, I think it got heated, the argument, and they called the police,<br>
 not to arrest anybody just to get the information out of them. Just to get<br>
 the story. Okay? Yes, so they come, and they start talking, &quot;Oh yeah, it<br>
 was just a political discussion that got a little heated.&quot; They get the<br>
 soldiers' names, they leave, they look for my brother and they can't find<br>
 him. They were like, &quot;Sir, we can't find you in the system.&quot; [Claps]<br>

 white? No, I'm Mexican. But at first, I thought I was white. I was like,<br>
 &quot;Dude, you're just a skater kid. You're American.&quot; Then after I started...<br>
 My dad told me, &quot;Dude, if you get arrested, that's going to be an issue.&quot;<br>
 That's when I realized, &quot;Bro, you're Mexican, dude, and this is part of<br>
 you. This is part of your roots. Just be proud of it. Grab it and be proud<br>
 of it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: So now I'm proud to be Mexican and it's awesome because when a white<br>
 guy thinks I'm white and I start speaking Spanish he's like, &quot;Whoa man, I<br>
 didn't know Mexicans could do all that.&quot; And it's like, &quot;Yeah, bro. Yeah,<br>
 man. I'm here to show that. I'm an example.&quot; So now I'm even more proud of<br>
 being Mexican.<br>
      <br>

 life because you can't go into college, you can't get good jobs. It's hard<br>
 to get a driver's license. You know what I'm saying? So, it really affected<br>
 the quality of my life, I would say. And so that would be a yes, being<br>
 undocumented does affect you.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: Yeah. What I'm trying to figure out is, is there a certain stage of<br>
 your life where all of a sudden you realized that it was different for you?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Oh yeah, for sure. For sure. When my dad started telling me, &quot;Bro,<br>
 if you get arrested, you're going to get deported,&quot; and when he started<br>
 telling me, &quot;If you don't finish school, you're not going to do anything.<br>
 You're going to be the illegal migrant working construction.&quot; And so, when<br>
 I started, I was like, &quot;Oh man, this means that I'm like them.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span><span id="68d0067b-9a8b-4976-96e5-d4309e1f9c25" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Immigration status, Living undocumented, Police: US, Interactions with police">Anita: So, you said, though, that it was also difficult being undocumented<br>
 and that that contributed to—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: That pretty much affected my whole life in the U.S. Being somebody<br>
 that spoke perfect English, and I had a lot of good characteristics, but<br>
 just wasn't accepted because of the legal information. Funny story, though,<br>
 one day I was skateboarding on private property. Police came and they<br>
 arrested me. Because me and my friends, we hopped this fence. It was<br>
 basically a school and it had a perfect hill. It looked like a skate park<br>
 almost. So, me and my friends were like, &quot;Dude, we have to skate this.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Anyway, we started filming. Police comes and they arrest us and so<br>
 they take my friends' information and whatever and they look for me in the<br>
 system and they can't find me. They were like, &quot;Mr. S__, we can't find you<br>
 in the system. Where were you born? This doesn't make any sense.&quot; So, I'm<br>
 like, &quot;Bro, this is it, this is it. I'm going to Mexico.&quot; They were like,<br>
 &quot;Are you native American, sir?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, sure. I'm native<br>
 American.&quot; “Okay, well, that's fine. You're free to go, sir, don't worry<br>
 about it.” So, that saved my butt. The English and the way I looked saved<br>
 my butt a lot.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: And your name.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: And the name, too, probably had something to do with it, yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

 depression at a certain point. Tell me a little bit about that and then<br>
 we'll move back.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Yeah, so basically, I struggle with OCD, right? I'm sure you know<br>
 what that is. It's a double-edged sword, it's helped me out of a lot of<br>
 things to be more consistent. For example, if I'm doing a skateboarding<br>
 trick, if I land like this, I have to keep doing it over—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: Are you a skateboarder too?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Yeah, I have a lot of videos on YouTube. Dude, I was sponsored by a<br>
 skateboarding company called VIP.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: Really?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Bro, I think about my life sometimes it's like dude I almost forget<br>
 that I had a skateboarding career. That's crazy to me. But yeah, if I would<br>
 not land correctly, I would have to do it over until I landed in the middle<br>
 of the board. And so, I would do that 10 times and then I would feel good.<br>
 So that helped me to be more consistent but, at the same time, it does<br>
 cause anxiety and stuff like that. It's a double-edged sword.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Anyways, I was struggling with OCD, I was like, &quot;Man, you're just a<br>
 freaking kid with OCD, dude. You're not going to do anything in life.&quot; And<br>
 I started playing these Robert Johnson songs and my dad sees it. He's like,<br>
 &quot;You know what, man? I'm going to try and motivate this guy so he can get<br>
 more into it.&quot; So, he would talk to me, he offered me money. And so, I<br>
 started getting into these songs and I started feeling more spirit. More<br>
 enthusiasm. I'm like, &quot;Wow, dude, you don't just have to be this weird kid,<br>
 you can be a jazz musician. You could be something if you want to.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: And so, I just started playing and playing it and then that dude<br>
 just took my depression away, honestly. And now I have OCD, but I don't<br>
 even care. I know how to cope with it, and I know how to work around it.<br>
 So, it really gave me an identity, which was really important. I think I<br>
 was going through an identity crisis.<br>

 how to play one note on the guitar.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: Seriously?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Seriously, dude. And I would love to show you, not right now but<br>
 when you have time, a video of me playing and it's just... I'm not trying<br>
 to sound cocky but I'm very proud of that progress. Yeah. And you know it's<br>
 funny because my dad will be like, &quot;Dude, if you learn one whole song, if<br>
 you learn one whole Blues song, I'll give you $100.&quot; So, me being young and<br>
 money hungry I would stay up all night learning these songs and then in the<br>
 morning he would give me the money. So that also was a motivation like,<br>
 &quot;Dude, I'm just going to get this money.&quot; I would learn the songs and<br>
 stayed up all night like, &quot;Dad, I can play now.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Man, all<br>
 right. Here's the money.&quot; So, that was pretty cool.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: So, your dad was a musician. As a musician he must've been pretty<br>
 proud of you wanting to do that?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Yeah, he was really happy that I got into it but, for me, I would go<br>
 a little harder, he would offer me money, which was not necessary, but in a<br>
 way it was like, &quot;Dude, I want to just show my dad that I can play music<br>
 well. I can be like him in a way.&quot; So, yes, he motivated me a little bit.<br>
 And then he said I was better than him. After a year of playing he was<br>
 like, &quot;Dude, you're better than me now.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anita: Did you ever play with him?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: Yes, I would play sometimes. A rhythm like “[Singing 00:06:32] Doo<br>
 doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo” and he would just do the<br>
 “[Singing] dein neih neihn.”We would play sometimes but yeah, when he saw<br>
 that I got into it he supported that, for sure.<br>
      <br>

 living in the U.S., with what the African Americans went through?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: I think that I identified with it because when you're feeling at<br>
 your lowest point, and that's how these people were feeling, going through<br>
 all the racism and being judged by your color and through all this crap,<br>
 they were able to create gold, like a piece of gold. So, I was like, &quot;Man,<br>
 you are at your lowest point, but you could still do something if you want.<br>
 You can become somebody if you want. Just like these guys created this<br>
 amazing genre, you can be somebody if you really want.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: And so, it just gave me faith. I had low self-esteem. That uplifted<br>
 me and then I started playing guitar and got more girls in—just kidding,<br>
 just kidding [Anita laughs]. But, yes—<br>

 the U.S, not being able to find jobs, not being able to go into college was<br>
 difficult for me so I was falling into a depression. And then I came across<br>
 this guy called Robert Johnson. Robert Johnson is the king of the Delta<br>
 blues. He's one of the most important American musicians, ever.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: So, I started listening to his music and just the pain and the story<br>
 of him uplifted me. He was letting me know, &quot;You know what, you're healthy.<br>
 You're young. Look at these African American people back in the day, what<br>
 they went through and compared to what you're going through? Don't be a<br>
 sissy and don't complain.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: So that music just uplifted me, and it gave me energy and it let me<br>
 know, &quot;Bro, you don't have to just be this kid with”—because I had a lot of<br>
 anxiety—&quot;This kid with anxiety. You can play music and make people feel<br>
 good.&quot; And so that helped me out a lot and eventually that led me to, and<br>
 this is going to sound weird but, it led me to discover the purpose of what<br>
 a human is because, listen to this, when you play music, you're helping<br>
 other people out, right? And you're really contributing to the change that<br>
 you want to live in the future.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Billy: And I was, like, &quot;Dude, what's the purpose of a human being? Why are<br>
 we here?&quot; And it's simply to help others. That's all it is. It is to<br>
 contribute to the change you want to live in and it's very fulfilling when<br>
 you help somebody. And so that let me know, &quot;Dude, you're here to help<br>
 others and, yeah, just do it.&quot;<br>

      <br>
      <br>
</span> Billy: And jazz helped me discover that because it's like a chain. African</br> American people help each other out through their music, that helped other</br> people out, that helped me out. Eventually I took my friend out of a heroin</br> addiction because of that, because of the music. And I started crying when</br> he told me. He was like, &quot;Dude, I just wanted to thank you because you took</br> me out of my heroin addiction.&quot; I actually did something. So that music was</br> really important for me. It gave me an identity.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you were attracted to African American blues and jazz?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, because my brother was listening to it and so I'm like, &quot;Dude,</br> what are you listening to? This is weird We usually listen to rock.&quot; He's</br> like, &quot;Man, this is called blues, bro. This is a really cool music, and it</br> has to do with African American people back in the day and it tells the</br> story of America.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, I just looked into it and I became obsessed with it. I couldn't</br> stop. Once I discovered Louis Armstrong, that was just it. I could not stop</br> playing jazz and so yeah, in North Carolina, I was just feeling kinda</br> crappy and that music came at the perfect time.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Do you think that you identified at all, as an undocumented Mexican</br> living in the U.S., with what the African Americans went through?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I think that I identified with it because when you're feeling at</br> your lowest point, and that's how these people were feeling, going through</br> all the racism and being judged by your color and through all this crap,</br> they were able to create gold, like a piece of gold. So, I was like, &quot;Man,</br> you are at your lowest point, but you could still do something if you want.</br> You can become somebody if you want. Just like these guys created this</br> amazing genre, you can be somebody if you really want.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And so, it just gave me faith. I had low self-esteem. That uplifted</br> me and then I started playing guitar and got more girls in—just kidding,</br> just kidding [Anita laughs]. But, yes—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: It helped, probably [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: It helped a little bit, yeah [Anita laughs]. But it just came at the</br> perfect time, man. Honestly.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I was 21 when I started playing music. Prior to that I didn't know</br> how to play one note on the guitar.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Seriously?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Seriously, dude. And I would love to show you, not right now but</br> when you have time, a video of me playing and it's just... I'm not trying</br> to sound cocky but I'm very proud of that progress. Yeah. And you know it's</br> funny because my dad will be like, &quot;Dude, if you learn one whole song, if</br> you learn one whole Blues song, I'll give you $100.&quot; So, me being young and</br> money hungry I would stay up all night learning these songs and then in the</br> morning he would give me the money. So that also was a motivation like,</br> &quot;Dude, I'm just going to get this money.&quot; I would learn the songs and</br> stayed up all night like, &quot;Dad, I can play now.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Man, all</br> right. Here's the money.&quot; So, that was pretty cool.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, your dad was a musician. As a musician he must've been pretty</br> proud of you wanting to do that?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, he was really happy that I got into it but, for me, I would go</br> a little harder, he would offer me money, which was not necessary, but in a</br> way it was like, &quot;Dude, I want to just show my dad that I can play music</br> well. I can be like him in a way.&quot; So, yes, he motivated me a little bit.</br> And then he said I was better than him. After a year of playing he was</br> like, &quot;Dude, you're better than me now.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Did you ever play with him?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yes, I would play sometimes. A rhythm like “[Singing 00:06:32] Doo</br> doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo” and he would just do the</br> “[Singing] dein neih neihn.”We would play sometimes but yeah, when he saw</br> that I got into it he supported that, for sure.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, this Billy, is that really your name or is that musical name?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That's really my name. Everybody asks me that like, &quot;Dude, is your</br> real name Billy or is it William?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Or Guillermo, exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And it's really Billy… o Guillermo, exactly. But he named me after</br> Billy the Kid, which, he was a killer and a robber, but it's a very</br> important part of American history. It tells the story of the old West and</br> how the U.S. was before the industrial era. I think Billy the Kid's story</br> is pretty cool. He was not a good guy—but maybe he was, just in the wrong</br> time [Anita laughs]. But it's a very important story. You have to know</br> about that. So, yes, he named me after Billy the Kid, man. It's weird.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: But was he in the States already? How did he know about Billy the</br> Kid?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I don't know. Oh, because he used to watch Westerns with his dad in</br> Mexico. The black and white ones. Yeah, so he liked Billy the Kid and</br> stuff. He was like, &quot;Yeah, I'm going to name my kid Billy.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Wow and the Jack?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Billy... I have no idea where that came from. Maybe he just wanted</br> me to have a white name or something [Anita laughs]. I don't know why they</br> named me Billy my brother's name is Miguel ___. And—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, Miguel ___ and Billy?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, it's odd. You know what I think it was? He just saw I had</br> green eyes or something and he was like, &quot;No, I'm going to give this guy a</br> white name&quot; [Anita laughs]. I don't know. Something dumb like that. But</br> Billy is my name and a lot of people here are like, &quot;I've never met</br> somebody named Billy.&quot; Because it's not common in Mexico, that name. In the</br> U.S. it is.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: But it's weird because when I'm 50 years old you can't keep calling</br> me Billy. It sounds like a little kid name. You have to call me Bill or</br> something. And yeah, it just has to do with the Westerns. He really loves</br> Westerns, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: I just want to ask you one more question and then we move back.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I'm sorry if I'm—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: No, no, no. This is super cool. So, you said you fell into a</br> depression at a certain point. Tell me a little bit about that and then</br> we'll move back.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, so basically, I struggle with OCD, right? I'm sure you know</br> what that is. It's a double-edged sword, it's helped me out of a lot of</br> things to be more consistent. For example, if I'm doing a skateboarding</br> trick, if I land like this, I have to keep doing it over—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Are you a skateboarder too?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, I have a lot of videos on YouTube. Dude, I was sponsored by a</br> skateboarding company called VIP.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Bro, I think about my life sometimes it's like dude I almost forget</br> that I had a skateboarding career. That's crazy to me. But yeah, if I would</br> not land correctly, I would have to do it over until I landed in the middle</br> of the board. And so, I would do that 10 times and then I would feel good.</br> So that helped me to be more consistent but, at the same time, it does</br> cause anxiety and stuff like that. It's a double-edged sword.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Anyways, I was struggling with OCD, I was like, &quot;Man, you're just a</br> freaking kid with OCD, dude. You're not going to do anything in life.&quot; And</br> I started playing these Robert Johnson songs and my dad sees it. He's like,</br> &quot;You know what, man? I'm going to try and motivate this guy so he can get</br> more into it.&quot; So, he would talk to me, he offered me money. And so, I</br> started getting into these songs and I started feeling more spirit. More</br> enthusiasm. I'm like, &quot;Wow, dude, you don't just have to be this weird kid,</br> you can be a jazz musician. You could be something if you want to.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And so, I just started playing and playing it and then that dude</br> just took my depression away, honestly. And now I have OCD, but I don't</br> even care. I know how to cope with it, and I know how to work around it.</br> So, it really gave me an identity, which was really important. I think I</br> was going through an identity crisis.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you said, though, that it was also difficult being undocumented</br> and that that contributed to—</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That pretty much affected my whole life in the U.S. Being somebody</br> that spoke perfect English, and I had a lot of good characteristics, but</br> just wasn't accepted because of the legal information. Funny story, though,</br> one day I was skateboarding on private property. Police came and they</br> arrested me. Because me and my friends, we hopped this fence. It was</br> basically a school and it had a perfect hill. It looked like a skate park</br> almost. So, me and my friends were like, &quot;Dude, we have to skate this.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Anyway, we started filming. Police comes and they arrest us and so</br> they take my friends' information and whatever and they look for me in the</br> system and they can't find me. They were like, &quot;Mr. S__, we can't find you</br> in the system. Where were you born? This doesn't make any sense.&quot; So, I'm</br> like, &quot;Bro, this is it, this is it. I'm going to Mexico.&quot; They were like,</br> &quot;Are you native American, sir?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, sure. I'm native</br> American.&quot; “Okay, well, that's fine. You're free to go, sir, don't worry</br> about it.” So, that saved my butt. The English and the way I looked saved</br> my butt a lot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: And your name.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And the name, too, probably had something to do with it, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: The Jack was a good idea.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That's crazy, really. But yeah, we were skateboarding and yeah, that</br> helped me out a little bit. But what was the question?</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: I was asking about you said you felt depressed and I so you talked</br> about the OCD but, being undocumented, you said you started—</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Oh yeah, exactly. Being undocumented, it really affects your whole</br> life because you can't go into college, you can't get good jobs. It's hard</br> to get a driver's license. You know what I'm saying? So, it really affected</br> the quality of my life, I would say. And so that would be a yes, being</br> undocumented does affect you.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. What I'm trying to figure out is, is there a certain stage of</br> your life where all of a sudden you realized that it was different for you?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Oh yeah, for sure. For sure. When my dad started telling me, &quot;Bro,</br> if you get arrested, you're going to get deported,&quot; and when he started</br> telling me, &quot;If you don't finish school, you're not going to do anything.</br> You're going to be the illegal migrant working construction.&quot; And so, when</br> I started, I was like, &quot;Oh man, this means that I'm like them.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I am a Mexican right? And so, it's like, &quot;Dude, you're American but</br> you're not? This was crazy!” and so right there I was like, &quot;Dude, what am</br> I?&quot; At one point I was like, &quot;Dude, what am I? Am I...?&quot; Not in terms of</br> who I am, in personality, but my nationality. I was like, &quot;Am I American or</br> am I Mexican?&quot; Eventually I just said I was Mexican. That's my nationality,</br> that's where I was born but I had an experience in the U.S. you hear me?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, it's just like, because people are like, &quot;Bro, are you white?&quot;</br> I don't like saying I'm white because I'm not white. It's like, &quot;I'm not</br> white, Bro, I'm Mexican.&quot; They're like, &quot;How are you Mexican, man? How do</br> you speak English like that?&quot; It's like, &quot;Yeah, man. I'm Mexican. It's</br> cool, bro, it's cool.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you said you were Mexican. Why did you say you were Mexican?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Just because I couldn't say I was white. What am I going to say? I'm</br> white? No, I'm Mexican. But at first, I thought I was white. I was like,</br> &quot;Dude, you're just a skater kid. You're American.&quot; Then after I started...</br> My dad told me, &quot;Dude, if you get arrested, that's going to be an issue.&quot;</br> That's when I realized, &quot;Bro, you're Mexican, dude, and this is part of</br> you. This is part of your roots. Just be proud of it. Grab it and be proud</br> of it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So now I'm proud to be Mexican and it's awesome because when a white</br> guy thinks I'm white and I start speaking Spanish he's like, &quot;Whoa man, I</br> didn't know Mexicans could do all that.&quot; And it's like, &quot;Yeah, bro. Yeah,</br> man. I'm here to show that. I'm an example.&quot; So now I'm even more proud of</br> being Mexican.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, at what age do you remember that? What age did your father tell</br> you these things?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Oh, he started telling me this when I was 15.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: 15?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, when he started seeing that I was going out into the streets</br> more and hanging out with my friends he was like, &quot;Dude, be careful with</br> the law. Don't get arrested.&quot; But yeah, I think it's a good thing because</br> I'm an example that Mexicans are not just people that listen to reggaetón</br> and they like to drink. There's people like me. Oh, but you should meet my</br> brother. My brother's a... he reads philosophy all day. It's all he does is</br> read philosophy. Super smart guy. Super cool and yeah, he's very proud of</br> his Mexican culture. He even buys the Mexican shirts.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What the Mexican soccer jerseys or?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No, no, no. He buys the handmade shirts in Oaxaca that have the</br> designs and stuff. They're pretty expensive but he kills that standard.</br> Honestly.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. Where does he live?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: He lives here in ___ He got deported. That's the reason that I'm</br> here because me and my brother are one. We cannot be separated. It was</br> either he goes back to the U.S., which was not going to happen, or I go to</br> Mexico. That's the decision I made.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you came back with him?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No, I came back for him. He basically got deported. I'm going to</br> tell you the story. This is crazy. So my brother goes—he has a really good</br> job, he was getting paid $1,500 a week—goes out into this bar—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What did he do?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: He works in construction. He works on framing and they pay a lot for</br> that. So anyways. He goes down to a bar and he drinks-</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Like framing pictures?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No, framing as in the houses. You frame your house, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Oh, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Like the skeleton of a house.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Got it.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, he goes into this restaurant and he drinks a little bit. Then in</br> come these soldiers, U.S. soldiers, come into the restaurant.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, so they come in, they sit down and then they get into a</br> political discussion. That's already the first error. My brother, he starts</br> talking about the corruption dude and just about the government bro and</br> he's saying this to these U.S. soldiers.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: About the corruption?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yes, in the U.S. of course. So, the soldiers, I don't know what</br> happened, I think it got heated, the argument, and they called the police,</br> not to arrest anybody just to get the information out of them. Just to get</br> the story. Okay? Yes, so they come, and they start talking, &quot;Oh yeah, it</br> was just a political discussion that got a little heated.&quot; They get the</br> soldiers' names, they leave, they look for my brother and they can't find</br> him. They were like, &quot;Sir, we can't find you in the system.&quot; [Claps]</br> Deported.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Dude, a guy that's been in the U.S. his whole life just goes back to</br> Mexico like that. It actually made me cry when I saw his first photo that</br> he posted on Facebook. Him in Mexico. You could see that he's already been</br> burnt by the sun and he's wearing these Mexican clothes. I'm like, &quot;Damn,</br> my brother's in Mexico.&quot; That was tough for me, honestly.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Did he use to wear that stuff in the U.S. too?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No, I'm saying seeing him with these cheaper clothes. You've seen</br> him with these, because here in Mexico they wear... It's not like over</br> there. Over there it's easier to get quality. Over here it's a luxury. You</br> know what I mean? So, I'm like, &quot;Damn, this dude is already... he looks</br> Mexican, dude.&quot; It was crazy for me. And so, I'm like, &quot;Man, I can't leave</br> my brother there. I'm going to go back.&quot; So, I saved them 200 bucks and I</br> just took a plane here.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah. There's another reason as to why I came. I'm just going to go</br> ahead and tell it. This is very personal, but I don't care. So, my dad, he</br> started getting involved with another woman. This white girl. She had a</br> farm. She was more like a country girl. She was all about the country life.</br> So, my dad got involved with her and we ended up moving to a farm with her</br> and I was on the farm with them. It was awesome, to be honest, I had my own</br> little go-cart and I was working with horses. Had my own room.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: But then I would see them kissing and I would see them hugging and</br> that was just too much for me bro. It was too much knowing that my mom was</br> here in Mexico, busting her ass, and my dad is doing that. I'm like, &quot;Bro,</br> you're tripping, dude, doing this in front of me, man.&quot; I just felt</br> disrespected. I'm like, &quot;You know I love you, dad, but you're not very</br> considerate.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, I just got the money, I'm like, &quot;I'm just going to leave. It's</br> better that I don't see this because I'm going to end up getting stressed</br> out and pissed off.” So, I'm like, &quot;I'm just going to go to Mexico. I'm</br> going to be happy with my family, eating good food and save myself some</br> stress.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Does your mom know about your dad?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, she knows about that. She doesn't really say anything because</br> they give her money. My dad sends her money. But it's just sad and I feel</br> bad for her. A woman that devoted herself, all herself, all of her life to</br> this guy. It's like, &quot;Think about this, bro, you wasted your whole life, in</br> a way.&quot; I don't know. So yeah, that got me mad and that was just another</br> reason for me to come.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, she never went to the U.S.?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: She went to the U.S. and when they deported my brother, she didn't</br> want to leave him here by himself. So, she was like, &quot;Man, I got to go with</br> my baby. I have to go look after him.&quot; So, boom. Both of them leave. I'm</br> stuck there with my dad, on this farm, with this new woman. You know what</br> I'm saying?</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: But was your dad with the new woman while he was still with your</br> mom? Did they split up?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, but she discovered him because she snuck in his car and he was</br> driving to the farm like it's all good. And he pulls up to the farm and my</br> mom just hops out the back seat.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Oh my god.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah. She's like, &quot;What the hell are you doing, man? I knew you were</br> doing something.&quot; But it's weird. The lady, the white lady, actually calmed</br> my mom down and my mom ended up liking her. It was weird. So yeah, that was</br> strange. She ended up calming her down, sat her down, like, &quot;Relax. Don't</br> scream, don't get mad.&quot; It's just ironic because you have these three</br> people in the same room. It's just crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Either way, I think my mom understood that it wasn't her fault. She</br> didn't know anything about that and so that's probably why she didn't get</br> mad. But yeah, my mom knew while she was in the U.S.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: For how long was that going on before—</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That was going on for three months before my mom found out.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: And now...?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Now my mom just doesn't give a crap and she sits here in Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Has she found someone here?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: No. She's not even trying to date. Like I'm trying to tell you, she</br> gave her whole self and her whole personality to him. It's almost like</br> there is no other man for her. Super strange. And even today she talks good</br> about him. But here's the positive thing, they have talked to each other.</br> They're on the same page now. She forgave him. He feels bad for what he</br> did. And he broke up with the white woman.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: He did?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, he broke up with her.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Oh right. And he's going to come back?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And he's going to come back and supposedly, they're going to be</br> together when he comes back. They're going to reunite. My dad told me, and</br> he told me this in secret, he was like, &quot;Look man, the reason why I'm doing</br> this is because right now this woman is helping me out.&quot; She bought him a</br> car. I swear to god. This is so weird, bro. She literally went to the car</br> dealership, not even in payments, bro, just bought a car. $30,000 and just</br> gave it to my dad.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: She was that wealthy.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: She was a millionaire.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Really?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah, her husband, his name was Jack. Died of alcoholism but he was</br> very wealthy. He died and left her, bro, left her so much property, so much</br> money, so many things. And she ended up falling in love with my dad because</br> of the music. And when my dad got in a car crash—I forgot to tell you</br> this—that's the reason she bought the car was so he could go to work. And</br> so, she's a nice lady, bro. She's not mean at all, dude. She saw, &quot;Okay</br> this guy has a family to support. Can't get to work. I'm going to buy him a</br> car. Okay, this guy right now doesn't have anywhere to go, he can stay at</br> my place.&quot; So super nice lady and I don't have anything against her. It was</br> just... it was my dad. He was inconsiderate. But he's not a bad guy. How is</br> he a bad guy when he's been supporting two families for 18 years? He's the</br> nicest guy ever.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Two families?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Two families. Yeah, I'll just go ahead and tell you. So, my dad... I</br> have step-siblings. I have Alejandro, there's Miranda and Brenda. Brenda</br> died. She went to the U.S. and she died when she was 21 years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What'd she die of?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: She fell out of a building. Yes, it's crazy. It's not even like,</br> &quot;That's crazy-&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: An accident?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: It was an accident, yeah. Well, she was hanging, and she was with</br> her boyfriend, &quot;You don't love me I'm going to let go.&quot; She was playing.</br> Her arms couldn't lift up no more and so she just let go, man. She was only</br> there for three years.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, my dad is the nicest guy ever and I don't blame him for anything</br> he's done. If he decided to get involved with this white woman maybe it was</br> for a reason. Maybe it was so that we don't end up on the street. You never</br> know. And at the same time, he's a man. Maybe he got bored. Maybe he was</br> feeling lonely. Needed a companion, you know what I'm saying? And so, Norma</br> came up—that's her name, Norma—and he felt good. I don't blame him and I'm</br> nobody to judge him.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So yeah, that's another reason why I came back.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. You're so American.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: You know what? I am American but I'm also very Mexican. If you hear</br> me talking Spanish, I'm very like, from the city and got not much—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: You can do it?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah. I'm a Mexican boy dude.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, I'm going to ask you both these questions. In what way do you</br> feel American?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: The fact that I understand the culture. The fact that I grew up in</br> African American neighborhoods and lived the whole American experience. Not</br> just that but I had friends from all over. Friends from Cuba, living in</br> Miami. From Columbia. Then I had Asian friends, white friends, black</br> friends. I got into the skateboarding culture which really introduced me to</br> a big part of American life. Going out and filming with your friends.</br> Learning jazz music showed me the history of the U.S. and why African</br> American history is so important—it really, in a way, shaped what the U.S.</br> is.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And so, in those ways I consider myself American. Just those</br> experiences. But blood-wise, I'm Mexicano [Anita laughs]. Culturally and in</br> terms of my roots I'm Mexican. I've been exposed to the tacos al pastor. I</br> would give my friends Agua de Jamaica in the U.S. and they were like, &quot;Man,</br> what is this, bro? Man, what is this juice?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Bro, this is not</br> juice it's a plant.&quot; It's like, &quot;Man, this is good, bro. I got to buy</br> this.&quot; And stuff like that. I've been exposed to the Mexican culture, yeah.</br> And, of course, living in LA, Mexican culture's everywhere there. Think of</br> it.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. You spoke Spanish at home?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I had to speak Spanish because my mom doesn't speak English. So, in</br> order to communicate with my mom, right, I had to speak Spanish.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, you're completely fluent?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Completely fluent in Spanish. Another thing that I forgot to</br> mention, my mom's from Nicaragua. So, I'm half Nicaraguan and I lived in</br> Nicaragua for two years with my grandma. She had me locked up in a cage..</br> But my grandma is very overprotective, and she would have me... because the</br> houses have cages and so I would be behind this cage all day. She didn't</br> want to let me go outside. Very overprotective. But I lived in Nicaragua</br> and I got exposed to that culture. They're very simple people and very</br> poor.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. Do you miss anything about the States?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I miss speaking English with people. Because when I'm speaking</br> Spanish a lot of times, I'm trying to express a certain idea, but I don't</br> know how to use certain words. So let's say that I'm telling this guy, &quot;Oh</br> dude, that was a great experience.&quot; I don't know how to say 'experience' in</br> Spanish. It's like, “Oh esa fue una experiencia muy buena” It's just things</br> like that. And so yeah, just being able to speak very quickly in English</br> and express myself better. That's what I miss. Here I have to tell them in</br> Spanish “oh está aquí por la carretera y me fue algo muy excelente” and I</br> have to think when I'm speaking. And so, there's pauses and stuff. That</br> never happened to me before.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Did you face discrimination at all in the States?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Let me think about that. No, never. Never.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What about here?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: That's something that I always thought about like, &quot;Dude, I never</br> went through racism in the U.S., but I saw my brother go through it, so I</br> understood it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Was your brother... what is it your brother-</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: My brother, he looks like me, you get me? He has the nose, speaks</br> like me, he has the characteristics but he's darker and he has brown eyes.</br> And I remember my friends would play around, &quot;Oh, Mexican. Or we're going</br> to go back to LA man,&quot; and they would mock him. They never did that to me.</br> And, as a matter of fact, this one white guy, he was like, &quot;Man to me</br> you're white, bud. To me you're white, bud.&quot; So, I never went through that.</br> I don't know why.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So, did African Americans discriminate against you?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Especially them, they're not going to discriminate. They go through</br> that every day. So, they're not going to do that. But they would be like,</br> &quot;Dude, I know you ain't fully white, you got black in you, don't you? You</br> got black, huh?&quot; I'm going like, &quot;Yeah, man I got black, bro, I got black.&quot;</br> And then I would sing the blues so they would be like, &quot;Yeah man, you got</br> black, man, for sure.” [Anita laughs]. You're like, “[Singing] She don't</br> even want it maybe,&quot; that type of music and so they feel it bro, they</br> really feel it.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Man, I'm going to tell you something. One day I was playing the</br> blues, I was like, “[Singing] Dun dun dun dun dun dn…I got a kindhearted</br> woman.” Then my friends starts rapping out of nowhere. He's like,</br> “[Singing] Yeah man you know I've got a kindhearted woman, she'd shine up</br> at him,” and just started rapping and he really felt that music. So,</br> African Americans were never racist with me and they actually thought that</br> I had black in me. They're like, &quot;Man, you're skinny, bro, but I don't</br> know, man, you don't look white. White people look different. Man, you've</br> got to have something in you, bro.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Dude, I have Nicaraguan in</br> me. And Mexican.&quot; So, they'd talk about that.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What about sports? Were you a sports fan?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Since I was nine years old, I was involved with sports. I was</br> playing basketball and stuff. They put me in soccer, but I couldn't do it</br> because people were kicking me in my shins [Anita laughs]. But horrible,</br> man. My dad put me in this little Mexican team. It wasn't like the American</br> soccer mom team. It was like a Mexican team and my fellow players they</br> would kick me in the shin man [Makes kicking noises]. After two weeks I was</br> like, &quot;Dad, I can't do this no more, please. Can't do it.” [Anita laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So you started doing what? What did you do instead?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: After that I started skateboarding. I got a skateboard and I did</br> that for 12 years of my life. Every day for 12 years of my life. And I</br> actually took that somewhere so that was pretty cool.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Were you a fan of sports teams?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: The Red Sox. I always like the Red Sox. Not because of—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: The Red Sox?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Yeah. And you know what? It has to do with the historicity of it.</br> They were the first baseball team in the U.S. They have so much history.</br> When you look at the old pictures, they have the big mustaches and the</br> baseball bats. It just looks crazy and so I really like the history of it.</br> And even just back in the '20s when they first started filming baseball and</br> stuff. So, I just like the history of the Red Sox, but I don't watch it</br> every Saturday.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: But yeah, after soccer I got into skateboarding and that became my</br> whole life. Then I suffered a really serious injury when I was 21. I was</br> doing a kick flip. I'm like, “Boom kick flip,” but then I throw it out in</br> midair and I land with all my weight on my leg and my leg went backwards.</br> So, I tore my ACL and that ruined my skateboarding career forever. I can</br> still skateboard, small ledges and flat ground, but I can't do it as a</br> career.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I think that's part of the reason I got into music too. I was in my</br> house bored, got to find something to do. So, I picked up the guitar and it</br> helped me out. But yeah, that injury stopped my whole career, but it</br> started a new one because when I got into music, I ended up doing gigs. Got</br> paid $100 an hour. Imagine you play three hours, $300.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Just by yourself you did the gigs?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: By myself. I have the pictures on Facebook from my first gig—I even</br> had the little blues hat. I was dressing all old-school and man, it was</br> amazing because these little kids in the South they love this music. So,</br> all these little kids would stand in front of me and I'm playing,</br> “[Singing] She don’t hear no…dun, dun, dun, nana….I’ve got a kind-hearted</br> woman.” And just the little kids sitting, and their parents applauding and</br> really involved in the music.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Could you do this music here in Mexico?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: There's been three times when I'm walking and I see a jazz band</br> playing on the street and I tell them, &quot;Bro, let me borrow your guitar. I</br> give you 50 pesos, man. Let me borrow your guitar, let me do a song.&quot; And</br> when I start playing a whole crowd gathers and they start giving them 50s</br> and tips and stuff. I'm not saying it's because of me, but I'm just saying</br> I start playing, “All of me.” “All of Me” is a song. And they start giving</br> them 50s and stuff. I'm like, &quot;Man, maybe I should just sit on a corner and</br> put a hat out you know?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: But would it be possible to do it professionally in gig places?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: It would be possible in weddings, restaurants, different gigs. But I</br> don't have the equipment. I don't have a band. It's just right now it’s not</br> good—I just have my acoustic guitar and my trumpet. But if I start making</br> money, I'd buy myself equipment and then I'll start finding gigs and then</br> maybe I can just start making that my job. Because it pays, what? 400, 500</br> pesos a day—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: It might be attractive in Mexico. Would people go to it? Are they</br> interested in that kind of music?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: People in Mexico are more into jazz than Americans, which is ironic</br> because Americans created jazz. So, people here are more into jazz. When</br> you start playing it, they're mesmerized. Like, &quot;Whoa, dude.&quot; And if you're</br> American it's even better for them, &quot;Man, you're playing jazz and stuff. I</br> really like jazz.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I guess, to them it's a novelty thing. They see it on the TV and on</br> YouTube, but they've never seen a ragged ass black dude with a saxophone.</br> [Makes saxophone noises]. That is an amazing sort of scenery right there;</br> you can see that these people have maintained their culture. So yeah,</br> they're really into jazz here in Mexico. To them it's almost a little</br> novelty thing, it's like a little movie thing. They've never seen a full</br> American, like a New Orleans jazz band, do you know what I mean? Hardcore.</br> They have not seen that. You have your—</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: You can make a career of this here.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Oh, you can make a career here, easily, out of jazz.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Can you do it by yourself or do you need a band?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: You can do it by yourself, but I would need equipment and somebody</br> to show me restaurants and places. It just takes time and I got to adapt a</br> little bit more.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Yeah. So, racism here, have you felt it?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Over here it's not about racism. Over here it's about money. Over</br> here if you have good shoes and good pants, that's your stature. In the</br> U.S. it's about color. If you're white and tall you can do whatever you</br> want [Chuckle]. No, I'm just kidding. But here it—</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Here it's about money, okay? It’s about your economic situation.</br> Because Mexico is such an old country and the economic situation's not that</br> good. You know if you have Jordans it's like, &quot;Whoa man. This dude has</br> Jordans.&quot; In the U.S., it's like, &quot;Yeah, I got Jordans. So what?&quot; So here</br> it's about money. You could be ugly or whatever, you're going to have a</br> pretty girl.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: In the U.S. it's more about race, obviously because of the history</br> between the black and the white. It’s about race. If you're a tall white</br> guy with green eyes, I'm telling you, it's so stupid, you get so many</br> opportunities.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: I know.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: And so, that's what I would say.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: They're living in a country which is not first world like the U.S.,</br> and they know that themselves. They know that, okay, this is a dude that's</br> coming from—I forgot the word, my dad told me—a more privileged country,</br> obviously. And so, people here, dude even when they look at American TV</br> shows they're very involved in that culture.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, I've never gone through like, &quot;Oh, go back to the U.S.,&quot; as a</br> matter of fact, they're like, &quot;Dude, how is the U.S. bro? I've always</br> wanted to go. I want to see California.&quot; So, never any racism. Maybe people</br> that are jealous, for example, I've been on the Metro and like this dude is</br> with his girl. He starts making out with his girl. He’s like, &quot;Bro relax</br> man. I'm not going to take your girl. Have a little self-esteem, you know?&quot;</br> Or when I'm buying a Gatorade, they charge me 22 pesos instead of 15.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Because they think you're American.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Because they think that I'm American or something. I'll be like,</br> &quot;Hey, can I get a Gatorade?&quot; They're like, “que es eso? No tenemos eso”.</br> [what’s that?] I say, “Señora que está hablando, alla hay un Gatorade atrás</br> de usted” Oh eso se llama G-A-T-O-R-A-D-E mi hijo, no podemos tener [Ma’am</br> what are you talking about, there is one behind you. Oh that, that is</br> called G-A-T-O-R-A-D-E my son, so we don’t have] -- So yeah, stuff like</br> that but not any racism. Like stuff like, &quot;Oh, go back to America you</br> fucking gringo,&quot; nothing like that. Excuse my language.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: And, I was going to ask you another question, have you got your high</br> school diploma certified and all that? Do you have other papers?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I have my report cards and my diploma, but I haven't... I don't know</br> I haven't brought my diploma here. But I have documents.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Don't you want to continue studying?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I do want to continue studying a lot but right now, I need to help</br> my mom. But yeah, if the opportunity shows itself I will definitely study.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: I'm definitely going to do it once I get more stable. I'm going to</br> go to the [foreign language 00:39:36]. You know that's what it's called,</br> the [foreign language 00:39:38]. The university and I'm going to try to</br> study political science or something like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: So last question, you made this wonderful comment about the news and</br> Trump, Trump, Trump.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Oh, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: What do you think?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Well I think that Trump... It just has to do... because the U.S.</br> right now is very disoriented and there's been so much racism and</br> controversy that when they chose Trump they were in a state of</br> irrationality. People were just looking for something new. They wanted</br> something new. They didn't want to deal with the same thing every day. You</br> hear about this dude got shot or the case with Trayvon Martin. And you hear</br> about the same stuff every day, the school shootings.</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: So, they probably wanted something different and out of desperation</br> they were like, &quot;We need Trump,&quot; almost like when you're looking for hope.</br> It's like, &quot;We need Trump.&quot; But I think now everybody realizes that was a</br> mistake.</br>      </br>      </br> Anita: Everybody?</br>      </br>      </br> Billy: Not everybody but a lot of people that originally voted for him, now</br> they're against him, which is weird. Now they don't agree with his ideas,</br> they differ in the way that they think. So yeah, now I think a lot of</br> people realize that it wasn't a good idea. But more than anything it's just</br> like, in the state of shock or being disoriented you choose this guy and</br> that's just what happened.</br>      </div><\p>
