Because back in the day<br>
   you can cross easier and well in the towns, even in that day, like I<br>
   mentioned, you make less money. Even if you work hard, you make less money.<br>
   You have to own a business or do something to come up. And he went to the<br>
   States, we were living okay, but my mother didn't like that he was over<br>
   here all the time and then sometimes he would just come. So, her little<br>
   light bulb went off and she said, &quot;Either you take all of us, or I don't<br>
   know, you know? I know you send me money and I know you come from time to<br>
   time, but that's not it. I want to be with you.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And there were three of you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Three of us.</span> And my mom—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Three boys?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, three boys. She wanted a girl so, she tried with my oldest</br>   brother Luis, he came out a boy, then me, I came out a boy, and then Tony,</br>   the other one that's here in Mexico too, and then after that they waited</br>   around ten years, eight, ten, years. And that's when, once in the States,</br>   they had Junior and Moses. When she had Moses, another boy, and then she</br>   waited another year and a half and we told her, &quot;Try mom, try it.&quot; She</br>   really wanted a girl. This is her first girl, she's crazy over her.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: That's what happened. So, then my dad took us, but the way he took us</br>   was in the airplane. Back in the day, since we're kids, you would just go</br>   as somebody else's kids.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, they just convinced us to say Daddy to some—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Random person?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah. And they flew us over for a low low price. Back in the day it</br>   was cheaper and safe because we were going in the airplane, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Sure. You went just to L.A.? Went through customs, and there you</br>   were.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, straight to L.A. And then we got to East L.A. and then from</br>   there—we lived there for a little bit—and then we moved to Long Beach.</br>   Supposedly because it was less violent. It's the same thing, you know? Just</br>   more races involved. Like in East LA we had nothing but Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mexicans, right.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: It's mostly Mexicans. There's a part of there, Salvadorians and a</br>   little bit of African American people, but mainly it's like little Mexico</br>   and shit. But there's a lot of gang activity and it's between the same</br>   race. I mean we would have to duck for cover sometimes when we would hear</br>   people running by because we lived on the street that separated the</br>   neighborhoods. So, this is one neighborhood, and this is another one.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, they would go back and forth?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah. So that's why we moved but when we moved to Long Beach, it's</br>   like there's still gang activity but just between more races. There's</br>   Asians, there's some more Caucasians, it's everything. Long Beach is a very</br>   multiracial community. There's a lot of Cambodians. There's everything. So,</br>   there's more races, there's more gangs, you know? And there's a lot of</br>   races.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I can imagine.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Like I remember when we were growing up in elementary, you have your</br>   black friends, you have your Asian friends, you have your white friends and</br>   everything's cool. But once you start getting to middle school, or the end</br>   of middle school, or high school, you start noticing things and they start</br>   letting you know about stuff. And once you hit jail or juvey it's over.</br>   It's racism full blast, you know? I mean people that I grew up with, they</br>   were not like my enemies, but we couldn't, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you hung with the Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Well I hung with everybody. But once you hit jail, you can't hang.</br>   You can talk to them, but you just can't share food, you can't do certain</br>   things.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: But I've never been racist in my life because I had black girlfriends</br>   and one or another different races.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, in elementary school, you say everything was good?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, it starts happening before you can get out of middle school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you like school back then?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I was in AVID [Advancement Via Individual Determination] program for</br>   diligent students, they skipped me a grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Skipped a grade?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, I wasn't bad in school, I just missed a lot and my decisions. I</br>   was in, it’s called, Gate Excel for Diligent Students back in 90 something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Gifted and talented?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, for the diligent gifted and talented. And I got in trouble, and</br>   they sent me to another school, and they put in the AVID program, that was</br>   also for the advanced. They used to take us to Cal State Long Beach to see</br>   what we would be looking into.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, it was just my decisions that took me out of where I was headed</br>   to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when did you first get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Middle school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Middle school. And when did you—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Ditching. It's because I would always hang out with the older people</br>   since I always looked older. I was in middle school going to high school,</br>   ditching, parties, and you know messing around with high school girls and</br>   all of that stuff. And that's when you run into the police. They would take</br>   me to truancy center when I would ditch sometimes, and they would catch us.</br>   Things like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do any sports or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: No. I didn't so sports. They wanted me to play football. There was a</br>   Samoan coach. They're really good at all that. And they would always tell</br>   me, &quot;Hugo, you're wasting your time, man, stop being on the streets. Let's</br>   play football.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: But again, my decisions, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think, was it because of your home life that you decided to do</br>   these—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: The thing is my parents never... I don't think my parents did wrong;</br>   they were just unaware of the way of life over there. My dad worked all</br>   day. I never seen my dad drunk, smoke weed, do any drug, hit my mother,</br>   abuse her verbally, nothing. If my mom had a dream of him kissing a girl 30</br>   years ago, she would wake up mad with him and my dad would be, &quot;Babe, I</br>   don't want to argue.&quot; He'd grab his newspaper and go into the bathroom. And</br>   I've never seen him do anything that they would be like, “Oh that's why I</br>   do this.” No. But he always had work. And my mom didn't know a lot, they</br>   didn't know, and my mom didn't really understand people, so it was hard for</br>   them to guide us. Right now, my two youngest brothers that live over there,</br>   that were born there, my parents got them good. [Snaps]. They know how to</br>   guide them. They're both college-bound, university-bound. One of them is</br>   about to graduate, today as a matter of fact, from Poly High School.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, that's great.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And the other one's already going to City College, right there in</br>   Long Beach too. And we always give them advice. I mean, aside from them</br>   seeing the result of our choices, I always tell them, “You know mom and dad</br>   tell you stay in school, don't do this, don't do that, it might seem boring</br>   at the moment, but it's for your good. Where do you see us?” I tell them,</br>   “If I would have listened to mom since little, since I was your guys age or</br>   smaller, we would have had a nice home over there and maybe a pool in the</br>   backyard. We would have already applied for the Dream act, DACA, all of</br>   it.” And since I wasn't dumb in school, I mean I could have made it far,</br>   but my decisions, no? And so, I always tell them that. And they're like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, it's a little boring, but yes, we understand.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And they would see when the cops would get there, because sometimes</br>   we would fight. We would do dumb things. They didn't stay with the</br>   curiosity of trying to be us. They seen all negative things happen from</br>   what we were doing, from our decisions. Thank God, at least that helped</br>   out, no? I mean, for them. So that's what I tell them, “The parties, the</br>   women, all the things that you guys think about, when you're a doctor, when</br>   you're an engineer, when you've already done your thing, it's still going</br>   to be there. And when you guys go to the university, you guys are going to</br>   have fun.” I tell them that I wish I would have gone to the university</br>   because that was one of my biggest things that I wanted to do, but I messed</br>   up. So, I tell them, “Take advantage, go through life for real, enjoy the</br>   real life. You guys are born there, you guys have all the odds in your</br>   favor.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's right.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: “You guys have parents that love you. My parents don't drink, my</br>   parents don't abuse you guys, my parents really care for you. What more do</br>   you guys want? I know you might think that life right now, it's boring—”</br>   because they live where it's a high crime area and things like that. But,</br>   once they move up, and once they get to be where they have to be, I tell</br>   them, “You guys are going to enjoy your life once you have your big house</br>   in the hills. When you know, things or different things or once you live a</br>   little bit better, you guys are going to enjoy all that and you're going to</br>   thank mom and dad.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when did you first go to juvey? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I was 14. The thing is when you grow up and you feel like you were</br>   born there—my dad used to tell us, &quot;I don't know you guys are in the street</br>   all day. I mean you guys have your home here, you can eat whenever you</br>   want, you can shower whenever you want, listen to music whenever you want.&quot;</br>   But that was boring to us. So, we would go into the street. There was three</br>   of us. Three brothers. And we'd go into the street, kick it in the alleys,</br>   you know like people do over there.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: We started hanging with certain people, you know? And things</br>   happened, they come around with G-rides, stolen cars, things like that. And</br>   it seems easy for you to take a joy ride, “Oh we'll take it over there to</br>   certain people's houses.” You get caught up. That's the first time I got</br>   caught. I didn't steal the car. Somebody came by, I took it, but it was a</br>   stolen car. I knew what I was doing, so they locked me up for grand theft</br>   auto or receiving stolen property or what not.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long were you—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Not long, a few months.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your parents must have been upset.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Oh yes. My parents don't like none of that. They've always taught us,</br>   they say, “We go into somebody's home and you see a penny, you don't touch</br>   that penny. You don't do that.” My dad, the first time he seen my smoking</br>   weed, he smacked me. I heard the ding. Like I said, I'd never seen my dad</br>   drunk, I'd never seen my dad do any drugs, but I kind of liked it, so. I</br>   mean they showed us well. It was just… I don't know why. I don't know why</br>   we didn't take advantage of being over there. Now that I think about it, I</br>   wasted a lot of opportunity, but I mean all you can do is work at it now,</br>   you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. You got to move forward.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, like right now, I don't do nothing. I don't even consider no</br>   illegal activity, nothing. For what? I'm going to get busted here and,</br>   here, it's way worse. And aside from that, I did learn from my experience</br>   over there. If you don't learn from your life experience, then you must be</br>   really either really stupid or I don't know what. You know? Like a lot of</br>   people that come back over here get deported, they still continue to hustle</br>   here and try to do this and that. I mean, didn't you learn from your other</br>   experience? And that's where I'm right now.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I've had ideas that there's some type of programs or something that</br>   might help all people trying to go back and that would be awesome because</br>   it would all be legal. And what I'm working on is, if in case an</br>   opportunity comes up like that, I can show my past ten years: I've been a</br>   productive member of society or the community or what not, and no illegal</br>   activity, no bad, no ill will toward anyone, just working, having my</br>   family, doing my thing. What I have to do, you know? I have my license. I</br>   have my car. I pay my rent.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: But life here is different. Over there, you don't have to worry about</br>   a gas tank going out on you. You pay your gas bill and you have your gas</br>   all the time. You pay your water bill you can shower anytime, there's water</br>   all the time. You pay your electricity bill, you have light all month. Over</br>   here, if your gas tank run out or this and that, there's... It's a</br>   different way of living. Over there, it's more comfortable, you live</br>   better, and the money lasts a little longer. Like I've seen families, when</br>   I was over there, families that would come from here and they would all get</br>   to work. And in six months, they would have a car, they would have their</br>   apartments, they would already be moving up.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you have an 8-year-old.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, his name is Jacob Isaiah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you have an ex-partner?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. But she tell him… She's really bad, I hope she gets better. She</br>   has schizophrenia because she used to smoke crystal meth. I used to smoke</br>   crystal meth. But one day, as a crazy person, just me in the alley, I spoke</br>   to somebody upstairs and I told them, “You know what, I'm tired of this. I</br>   said I'm hurting my parents, I'm hurting my life, so—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you when you were doing all this?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Like 18, 19. Oh, I started at like 14, I stopped at 19, 20. But it</br>   was really hard. One of my brother's is kind of crazy from that. My baby</br>   mama too. She's schizophrenic, she gets paid a monthly—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, some sort of social security for disability.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, because she cannot work. And my little kid has gone through all</br>   that, you know? And he's a teacher's pet, he's super smart, he's reading at</br>   a 5th grade level and he's in 3rd grade. They had a little reading contest,</br>   he beat the 5th grader.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: He got the best of me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And do your parents help him out?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. Whenever they can, they go and take him, and they buy him food.</br>   Last time, I sent them five pairs of shoes, a gang of pants, nice shirts,</br>   nice sweaters. So, he knows I'm there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good. Do you get to talk to him much?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, I do. I talk to him almost every day. I have him on WhatsApp.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a picture?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. I just sent him a boat on Amazon, because he wanted a boat. Look</br>   this is the video.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He's so cute. Is it remote control?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That is so cool.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: It was around $200 but he really wanted it, so whatever I can do for</br>   my boy for him to feel I'm there, I will do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That is amazing. Wow. It better come back.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: It does. Yeah, it's a long range. It wasn't $200 for nothing.</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Let me show you a picture. But that's my Jacob. So, my parents,</br>   they've always kept me alive with him, and I always try to call. And I</br>   always video chat with him. I video chatted with him like two days ago.</br>   Because I'm planning on him coming for his vacation. He should be getting</br>   out of school in like seven days.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, so he'll come for the summer?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Hopefully, because last time his grandmother told me that he was</br>   going to come, I was about to buy the tickets, and then at the last minute,</br>   she said, “No, he's too small,” this and that, and they lied to me. They</br>   made me think that he was going to come and that didn't happen, but it's</br>   okay. We'll try it again this year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It will happen. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Look, this is my son. This is my son. That's him right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh my goodness, he's adorable.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, he's a teacher's pet. He helps out the teacher with the Spanish</br>   speakers, all of that. So, he got the best of both of us. He's very smart.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's amazing. Tell me about the final thing that got you deported</br>   for your first deportation.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: The weed ticket?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it was possession of weed.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, I went to juvey a few times, correct?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I went to Camp Gonzalez in Malibu. Calabasas Road, really nice over</br>   there. They have nice houses. I came out, I turned 18 in camp, in juvenile</br>   camp, right? So, the judge told me, &quot;If I see you again, you're going to be</br>   an adult and if I see you again, you know you were not born here, so you</br>   will be facing deportation.&quot; When I got out of camp, I was what? 18? And</br>   that's when I had my kid around there. And so, I stopped messing around. I</br>   started working as a security officer without a guard card—you know, under</br>   the table. They would pay me like 10 something and then after certain</br>   hours, they would pay me a little bit more. It was funny because I used to</br>   be bad or I would do bad decisions so when people would see me with a</br>   special security officer badge and looking like a cop, they'd be like,</br>   &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm trying to feed my kid, you can shut up</br>   and keep going.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And then I had a marijuana ticket. They stopped me, I had some</br>   marijuana, they gave me a ticket. A ticket that I could go do community</br>   service or that I could go pay $100, $200 fine whatever—it's not illegal in</br>   the States, in California. And one day before going to work, I was in the</br>   stroller with my kid, and my ex-baby mama, my ex-lady. We crossed the light</br>   walking, a red light, right? But this street is empty. And there happened</br>   to be a cop passing by. So, he pulls us over when we're pushing my baby in</br>   the stroller, when there's dead traffic, no traffic at all. He was</br>   Hispanic, he was Latino, his last name was Ramirez. And I'm like, I did get</br>   a little, you know, &quot;What? What are you stopping me for?&quot; &quot;Because you seen</br>   that I seen you crossing and you smiled at me. You laughed at me.&quot; “Ah, so</br>   you're stopping me because of your feelings?” You can't tell a cop that</br>   because oh my God, that's it, it's over.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, he's like, &quot;Look I'm going to run your name and if you have</br>   anything, I'm going to take you, this and that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Man why didn't</br>   you go to get somebody that's actually doing something? You see me with my</br>   baby and my baby mama, what do you think I'm doing? You think I'm up to no</br>   good or what? I'm about to go to work in a few hours. Why you messing with</br>   me? Go get somebody that's actually doing something.&quot; So, I shouldn't have</br>   run my mouth, but he could have not taken me. And he ran my name and he's</br>   like, &quot;Oh, you have a warrant for your arrest&quot;—$5,000 or something. Which</br>   is nothing. If the warrants are from $40,000 and under, they can decide to</br>   let you go, to pay a fine, to do community service. They can decide to not</br>   take you in. Because it's not even something big. It could have been fixed</br>   with me paying or community service.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, I didn't get more mad, I realized there was a warrant, and then I</br>   went off on him. He was going to take me, so I softened up, and I was like,</br>   &quot;You know what? I'm about to go to work, I'm the man of the house, my wife</br>   doesn't work, I have to pay the bills. I got to go. Don't take me in. You</br>   know I can fix that in court.&quot; &quot;No, no, no. For being a loudmouth, I'm</br>   going to take you in.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;You know I've got an ICE hold because</br>   it shows there. If you take me in for that, they're going to deport me.&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Who's going to take care of my family?&quot; He was like, &quot;Well</br>   you should have thought of that when you ran your mouth.&quot; And I was like,</br>   &quot;Well you have the decision of letting me go and I can fix this with a</br>   payment or anything, but you're going to mess up my family. I'm going to</br>   get deported.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And I told him, &quot;Man, you're Mexican, you're Hispanic, you might be</br>   the first, second, third, generation, but I bet your people before that</br>   weren't. Think about that shit man.&quot; He still took me. I went in. And like</br>   36 hours later, no 24, almost a day and a half, only the time that it takes</br>   to process in and process out, that's how I paid my sentence. 15 days,</br>   which is, you do 10% of 15 days, how much time is it? Nothing. In and out.</br>   But on the way out, you're getting dressed and everything and ICE is</br>   already there &quot;You've been in jail a few times and you've never seen ICE?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Well no.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, they're like, &quot;Where were you born?&quot; This and that. And that's</br>   it, they took me. And that's where I went to the immigration library and I</br>   started looking at the different things that you can apply for.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, for three months, you were there?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Because I wanted to see how I can stay there. And it was in</br>   Lancaster. Well at the end, I got the voluntary departure. And I was</br>   supposed to get out of the country, in two years marry my ex, marry her in</br>   Mexico, and with her ask for a pardon.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: She's a U.S. citizen. And her daddy used to tell me, &quot;Just get</br>   married already. She has papers.&quot; But I was like, &quot;No. It's because I don't</br>   just want to do it just for the papers, you know? I want to buy her a</br>   little ring, do a little something.” But so, that's what happened, so then</br>   that's how I got deported. It wasn't even like I did something major or</br>   anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, that's crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I mean I know when I was younger, I did receive stolen property, I</br>   did make bad decisions, but that's all involved with drug abuse and use.</br>   It's not like, I woke up and I said, “I'm going to go steal a car.” No, I</br>   was making bad decisions, you know, dumb stuff. It's not like any other</br>   Americans never did it. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Any Americans, regardless of their race, you know? And that's what</br>   happened. So, I'm working for a juvenile record and marijuana ticket as an</br>   adult.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then how long where you in Mexico before you tried to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: About a year. 11 months, almost a year. And then my father was going</br>   to help me, he was going to pay for the coyote—$4,000-$5,000. But it’s</br>   okay, if you don't cross, you don't pay, so it's okay. They didn't spend</br>   the money or anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you got caught at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, I got caught at the border. So, then they were going to send me</br>   out back to TJ. Which I wanted; I would have just tried to cross.</br>   Unfortunately, that's what I would have tried to do. Because my son was</br>   over there. My girl lost her apartment, she had to sell our big California</br>   king bed that we had—I'm not worried about the bed, I just thought it was</br>   cool. But my baby—well not this baby, but my first born. She lost the</br>   apartment, she started selling the furniture because she didn't have no</br>   money, and she couldn't work, she had the baby. Things like that. So, my</br>   dad my was like, &quot;Okay come on.&quot; But yeah, that's what happened. 11 months,</br>   almost a year, I tried to go back, went to county. Well they give you state</br>   time, they give you state prison time, but since the prisons are packed,</br>   you do it in county, which is a little bit worse.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, it's worse?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Nobody wants to be in the county. Because you're sleeping next to a</br>   guy that doesn't know how much time he's going to do. So, it's not like</br>   you're scared, but there's kids that are crying because they are doing 2, 3</br>   years when the guy above you is facing 80 years to life. You better shut</br>   your mouth. You're going to get something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so, you were there for a year and then came back?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: A year and then 3 months in a detention. Oh, the last time, yes. No,</br>   the last time, I just got deported right after the... And that was it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then you decided lets—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Well not that I decided, I wanted to go right back. But my father was</br>   like... Because the first time I got deported, I stayed in Mexicali, so I</br>   never met my grandparents, none of them, I didn't see any of my aunties,</br>   uncles, or anything. So, my dad is like, &quot;Well this time you should go meet</br>   the family. You're going to be there three months.” But it's been six</br>   years, you know? So, he's like, “Go meet the family,” this and that. And</br>   so, I went to HIldago, that's where I met my grandpa. My grandfather, he's</br>   the man. I told my father, if I would have stayed here with my grandparents</br>   or my grandfather, I think I would have been way better off. I would have</br>   had a business or something. My grandfather knows how to cook bread. He</br>   knows how to construction. He's a mechanic and he's a farmer. So, I mean he</br>   doesn't have land, like a lot of land, but he gave every single one of his</br>   kid’s land, a little piece at least. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And he's the humblest person ever. I think I got some of his traits.</br>   He's no bull, he's good. He's an awesome person and he's 89 right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow. Well you got his brains. So, what do you miss about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: My family and the lifestyle. If I ever went back to the States, I</br>   wouldn't want to go back to Los Angeles. I wouldn't want to go there</br>   because of all the movement, people that I know. It's not like I'm going to</br>   go and make bad decisions. But, it's too hard. I want to be somewhere</br>   where's there not a lot of people. Maybe out of the city, you know? I</br>   wouldn't mind country living or anything like that because it's peaceful.</br>   Like when I go to visit my grandparents, it's a small town, you can take a</br>   deep breath of fresh air. Not like here. When we go over there to visit or</br>   like I took my baby, so she could meet her grandad and all the aunties and</br>   everything, and me and my girl didn't want to come back. We were just like,</br>   you know…But we have to come back and work. And over there, there's no call</br>   centers or anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What were your dreams when you were in the US? And what are your</br>   dreams now? Have they changed?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I wanted to be an architect and help my mom and my dad. Because my</br>   dad works a lot. And he's always up to something. But, bad decisions, you</br>   know? Like it feels good when you send them money from here, like from here</br>   we send them money. Other people they would say all your kids, your family,</br>   is the one that hits you hardest sometimes. My uncles and aunties they had</br>   their kids doing good and everything, &quot;Oh look at your kids, they're pieces</br>   of shit. They go to jail and they smoke, and this and that.&quot; And now that</br>   we're helping them out from here, it's like, nobody says nothing.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: One of my uncles, he's really really... I don't like him because he</br>   thinks he's the best and this and that. And one day I got home from work</br>   from the butchery or whatever, tired and I wanted to drink a beer. So, I</br>   put some music low and I was drinking a beer. And he had a whole case of</br>   beer upstairs himself. And, &quot;Why you drinking beer? You can't be</br>   disrespecting the house.&quot; I was like, &quot;Look Uncle, I'm not a kid. And you</br>   can't tell me anything. I just got here from work, I'm drinking a beer, and</br>   I have my music low. Don't get me fucked up, Uncle.&quot; I'm sorry for the bad</br>   words. &quot;I'm not a kid and you're not nobody to tell me anything. Who am I</br>   disrespecting?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And ever since that day, I was like, “Don't get it twisted Uncle.”</br>   You know? And I was like, &quot;You have your beer, what's the difference?&quot; And</br>   after that…I think it's because they had the picture of us all twisted, you</br>   know? We've made bad decisions, but we ain't bad people. We're not trash.</br>   We're nothing like that. I have values. I know how it is to live. I know</br>   what's the right way. How you are supposed to do it. And family is the main</br>   thing. At least to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And that's your dream?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. I still think of all that. I mean, right now, my parents</br>   probably be helped out with... My little brother's growing up, but we can</br>   help out too. Because my dad, he has diabetes. My mom does too. And my</br>   mom's one of them holy ladies that, “Jesus Christ, I have nothing, Jesus</br>   Christ will heal me.” I'm like, &quot;Yes, Jesus Christ will heal you, but take</br>   your medicine, take care of yourself.&quot; She was just in the hospital a month</br>   ago, in and out, and I kept telling her, &quot;Man, I believe your religion,</br>   Mother, pray to your Jesus, but take care of yourself too.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're a good son.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And she would always tell us that she was good, but she didn't tell</br>   us that... She would just tell us that she was good. But now I tell her,</br>   &quot;How good are you?&quot; Because my dad tells us, &quot;When she tells you she's</br>   good, she's not really good.&quot; And now she laughs, she's like, &quot;Okay, I feel</br>   this or that.&quot; And she's more honest with us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you had some ideas about programs to help returning</br>   migrants either to adjust here or to get back to the States. What were your</br>   ideas?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Well I don't know. Like at work sometimes, they apply for visas and</br>   stuff like that, but I don't know if its related to any programs of trying</br>   to go back or anything. But regardless of that, all I know if there was</br>   something like that, you would have to show that you've been doing</br>   something good for a while.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And that's what you're doing.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. I'm taking care of mine. I'm doing what I'm supposed to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Has life been okay in Mexico in the last six months?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, I mean it's okay, it's just you struggle way more. They don't</br>   take care of anything here, like government wise. I don't want my baby to</br>   be in a school. When we had Ilene over here, my stepdaughter, which is my</br>   daughter to the fullest—I don't even call her my stepdaughter. First, she</br>   didn't like me because my fiancé right now, her previous relationship was</br>   bad. The guy used to beat her up. And I might be a tough guy, but you don't</br>   touch a woman. And my dad made that clear to us. He said, &quot;The day you guys</br>   lift a finger to your mom, you're going to know who I am.&quot; Never</br>   disrespected my mom. And nobody either around the neighborhood, because</br>   they seen three big guys, &quot;Oh that's your sons? Those are your kids?&quot;</br>   &quot;Yeah, yeah, that's my mom right there.&quot; And it's different out here, but</br>   it's a little bit harder.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, she had her previous relationship and Ilene, she was born over</br>   there, but this girl came to follow this dumb ass that used to beat her up,</br>   that abandoned them when she was born. You know? But that's how we met, so,</br>   things happen. God works in mysterious ways, they say around there, you</br>   know? But he used to beat her up and he used to treat her bad and</br>   disrespected her and Ilene had that idea in her head.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: You know when she moved in with me, I never hit her, I never talked</br>   to her bad, but I would explain the things to her. I would grab her when</br>   she would be telling her mom that she was fat or ugly or things like that.</br>   And I'd be like, &quot;Ilene, come here please. I'm not your father miha. But</br>   I'm going to let you know what's right and wrong. And I don't care if you</br>   get mad or you cry, but you're going to listen to me. What does your mother</br>   do every day? Go to work. And why do you think she goes to work?” “To feed</br>   me.” “Why else? Do you need anything when you ask us for something, do we</br>   not provide it if its needed?” I will teach her with, prove her with</br>   things. I'd be like, “You can't talk to your mom like that. Your mom loves</br>   you.” I'm like, “When does your mom tell you that you're ugly or when does</br>   she make you feel bad?” I'm like, “How do you think she feels when you tell</br>   her that?” I'm like, “No, no, no.”</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And the first times, she would just stay quiet. And then sometimes,</br>   she would get really angry and she would hit me with that, &quot;You're not my</br>   dad.&quot; It's nothing, I know it's normal. And then after months, “Oh he's</br>   mine,” that I was all hers and then she told me if she could call me papi,</br>   if she can call me her dad. You can call me whatever you want miha. But the</br>   way she addresses her mom? Completely different.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's tough.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I educated her on why she shouldn't treat her mom a certain way, what</br>   her mother does for her.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="e2f3acae-1d1c-4916-a598-be4fb65cadb5" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Identity, Values">Anne: Do you think living in the US made you a different person than you<br>

   know? Like it feels good when you send them money from here, like from here<br>
   we send them money. Other people they would say all your kids, your family,<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: My family and the lifestyle. If I ever went back to the States, I<br>
   wouldn't want to go back to Los Angeles. I wouldn't want to go there<br>
   because of all the movement, people that I know. It's not like I'm going to<br>
   go and make bad decisions. But, it's too hard. I want to be somewhere<br>
   where's there not a lot of people. Maybe out of the city, you know? I<br>
   wouldn't mind country living or anything like that because it's peaceful.<br>
   Like when I go to visit my grandparents, it's a small town, you can take a<br>
   deep breath of fresh air. Not like here. When we go over there to visit or<br>
   like I took my baby, so she could meet her grandad and all the aunties and<br>
   everything, and me and my girl didn't want to come back. We were just like,<br>
   you know…But we have to come back and work. And over there, there's no call<br>

   almost a year, I tried to go back, went to county. Well they give you state<br>

   you do it in county, which is a little bit worse.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Oh, it's worse?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Nobody wants to be in the county. Because you're sleeping next to a<br>

   you're scared, but there's kids that are crying because they are doing 2, 3<br>

 <br>
   Hugo: About a year. 11 months, almost a year. And then my father was going<br>
   to help me, he was going to pay for the coyote—$4,000-$5,000. But it’s<br>
   okay, if you don't cross, you don't pay, so it's okay. They didn't spend<br>

   Americans never did it. You know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>

   marijuana, they gave me a ticket. A ticket that I could go do community<br>
   service or that I could go pay $100, $200 fine whatever—it's not illegal in<br>
   the States, in California. And one day before going to work, I was in the<br>
   stroller with my kid, and my ex-baby mama, my ex-lady. We crossed the light<br>
   walking, a red light, right? But this street is empty. And there happened<br>
   to be a cop passing by. So, he pulls us over when we're pushing my baby in<br>
   the stroller, when there's dead traffic, no traffic at all. He was<br>
   Hispanic, he was Latino, his last name was Ramirez. And I'm like, I did get<br>
   a little, you know, &quot;What? What are you stopping me for?&quot; &quot;Because you seen<br>
   that I seen you crossing and you smiled at me. You laughed at me.&quot; “Ah, so<br>
   you're stopping me because of your feelings?” You can't tell a cop that<br>
   because oh my God, that's it, it's over.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: So, he's like, &quot;Look I'm going to run your name and if you have<br>
   anything, I'm going to take you, this and that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Man why didn't<br>
   you go to get somebody that's actually doing something? You see me with my<br>
   baby and my baby mama, what do you think I'm doing? You think I'm up to no<br>
   good or what? I'm about to go to work in a few hours. Why you messing with<br>
   me? Go get somebody that's actually doing something.&quot; So, I shouldn't have<br>
   run my mouth, but he could have not taken me. And he ran my name and he's<br>
   like, &quot;Oh, you have a warrant for your arrest&quot;—$5,000 or something. Which<br>
   is nothing. If the warrants are from $40,000 and under, they can decide to<br>
   let you go, to pay a fine, to do community service. They can decide to not<br>
   take you in. Because it's not even something big. It could have been fixed<br>
   with me paying or community service.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: So, I didn't get more mad, I realized there was a warrant, and then I<br>
   went off on him. He was going to take me, so I softened up, and I was like,<br>
   &quot;You know what? I'm about to go to work, I'm the man of the house, my wife<br>
   doesn't work, I have to pay the bills. I got to go. Don't take me in. You<br>
   know I can fix that in court.&quot; &quot;No, no, no. For being a loudmouth, I'm<br>
   going to take you in.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;You know I've got an ICE hold because<br>
   it shows there. If you take me in for that, they're going to deport me.&quot;<br>
   And I was like, &quot;Who's going to take care of my family?&quot; He was like, &quot;Well<br>
   you should have thought of that when you ran your mouth.&quot; And I was like,<br>
   &quot;Well you have the decision of letting me go and I can fix this with a<br>
   payment or anything, but you're going to mess up my family. I'm going to<br>
   get deported.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And I told him, &quot;Man, you're Mexican, you're Hispanic, you might be<br>
   the first, second, third, generation, but I bet your people before that<br>
   weren't. Think about that shit man.&quot; He still took me. I went in. And like<br>
   36 hours later, no 24, almost a day and a half, only the time that it takes<br>
   to process in and process out, that's how I paid my sentence. 15 days,<br>
   which is, you do 10% of 15 days, how much time is it? Nothing. In and out.<br>
   But on the way out, you're getting dressed and everything and ICE is<br>
   already there &quot;You've been in jail a few times and you've never seen ICE?&quot;<br>
   And I was like, &quot;Well no.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, they're like, &quot;Where were you born?&quot; This and that. And that's<br>
   it, they took me. And that's where I went to the immigration library and I<br>
   started looking at the different things that you can apply for.<br>

They</br>   made me think that he was going to come and that didn't happen, but it's</br>   okay. We'll try it again this year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It will happen.

I was in middle school going to high school,</br>   ditching, parties, and you know messing around with high school girls and</br>   all of that stuff. And that's when you run into the police.

Let's</br>   play football.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: But again, my decisions, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think, was it because of your home life that you decided to do</br>   these—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: The thing is my parents never... I don't think my parents did wrong;</br>   they were just unaware of the way of life over there. My dad worked all</br>   day. I never seen my dad drunk, smoke weed, do any drug, hit my mother,</br>   abuse her verbally, nothing. If my mom had a dream of him kissing a girl 30</br>   years ago, she would wake up mad with him and my dad would be, &quot;Babe, I</br>   don't want to argue.&quot; He'd grab his newspaper and go into the bathroom. And</br>   I've never seen him do anything that they would be like, “Oh that's why I</br>   do this.” No. But he always had work. And my mom didn't know a lot, they</br>   didn't know, and my mom didn't really understand people, so it was hard for</br>   them to guide us. Right now, my two youngest brothers that live over there,</br>   that were born there, my parents got them good. [Snaps]. They know how to</br>   guide them. They're both college-bound, university-bound. One of them is</br>   about to graduate, today as a matter of fact, from Poly High School.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, that's great.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And the other one's already going to City College, right there in</br>   Long Beach too. And we always give them advice. I mean, aside from them</br>   seeing the result of our choices, I always tell them, “You know mom and dad</br>   tell you stay in school, don't do this, don't do that, it might seem boring</br>   at the moment, but it's for your good. Where do you see us?” I tell them,</br>   “If I would have listened to mom since little, since I was your guys age or</br>   smaller, we would have had a nice home over there and maybe a pool in the</br>   backyard. We would have already applied for the Dream act, DACA, all of</br>   it.” And since I wasn't dumb in school, I mean I could have made it far,</br>   but my decisions, no? And so, I always tell them that. And they're like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, it's a little boring, but yes, we understand.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And they would see when the cops would get there, because sometimes</br>   we would fight. We would do dumb things. They didn't stay with the</br>   curiosity of trying to be us. They seen all negative things happen from</br>   what we were doing, from our decisions. Thank God, at least that helped</br>   out, no? I mean, for them. So that's what I tell them, “The parties, the</br>   women, all the things that you guys think about, when you're a doctor, when</br>   you're an engineer, when you've already done your thing, it's still going</br>   to be there. And when you guys go to the university, you guys are going to</br>   have fun.” I tell them that I wish I would have gone to the university</br>   because that was one of my biggest things that I wanted to do, but I messed</br>   up. So, I tell them, “Take advantage, go through life for real, enjoy the</br>   real life. You guys are born there, you guys have all the odds in your</br>   favor.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's right.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: “You guys have parents that love you. My parents don't drink, my</br>   parents don't abuse you guys, my parents really care for you. What more do</br>   you guys want? I know you might think that life right now, it's boring—”</br>   because they live where it's a high crime area and things like that. But,</br>   once they move up, and once they get to be where they have to be, I tell</br>   them, “You guys are going to enjoy your life once you have your big house</br>   in the hills. When you know, things or different things or once you live a</br>   little bit better, you guys are going to enjoy all that and you're going to</br>   thank mom and dad.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when did you first go to juvey? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I was 14. The thing is when you grow up and you feel like you were</br>   born there—my dad used to tell us, &quot;I don't know you guys are in the street</br>   all day. I mean you guys have your home here, you can eat whenever you</br>   want, you can shower whenever you want, listen to music whenever you want.&quot;</br>   But that was boring to us. So, we would go into the street. There was three</br>   of us. Three brothers. And we'd go into the street, kick it in the alleys,</br>   you know like people do over there.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: We started hanging with certain people, you know? And things</br>   happened, they come around with G-rides, stolen cars, things like that. And</br>   it seems easy for you to take a joy ride, “Oh we'll take it over there to</br>   certain people's houses.” You get caught up. That's the first time I got</br>   caught. I didn't steal the car. Somebody came by, I took it, but it was a</br>   stolen car. I knew what I was doing, so they locked me up for grand theft</br>   auto or receiving stolen property or what not.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long were you—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Not long, a few months.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your parents must have been upset.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Oh yes. My parents don't like none of that. They've always taught us,</br>   they say, “We go into somebody's home and you see a penny, you don't touch</br>   that penny. You don't do that.” My dad, the first time he seen my smoking</br>   weed, he smacked me. I heard the ding. Like I said, I'd never seen my dad</br>   drunk, I'd never seen my dad do any drugs, but I kind of liked it, so. I</br>   mean they showed us well. It was just… I don't know why. I don't know why</br>   we didn't take advantage of being over there. Now that I think about it, I</br>   wasted a lot of opportunity, but I mean all you can do is work at it now,</br>   you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. You got to move forward.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, like right now, I don't do nothing. I don't even consider no</br>   illegal activity, nothing. For what? I'm going to get busted here and,</br>   here, it's way worse. And aside from that, I did learn from my experience</br>   over there. If you don't learn from your life experience, then you must be</br>   really either really stupid or I don't know what. You know? Like a lot of</br>   people that come back over here get deported, they still continue to hustle</br>   here and try to do this and that. I mean, didn't you learn from your other</br>   experience? And that's where I'm right now.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I've had ideas that there's some type of programs or something that</br>   might help all people trying to go back and that would be awesome because</br>   it would all be legal. And what I'm working on is, if in case an</br>   opportunity comes up like that, I can show my past ten years: I've been a</br>   productive member of society or the community or what not, and no illegal</br>   activity, no bad, no ill will toward anyone, just working, having my</br>   family, doing my thing. What I have to do, you know? I have my license. I</br>   have my car. I pay my rent.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: But life here is different. Over there, you don't have to worry about</br>   a gas tank going out on you. You pay your gas bill and you have your gas</br>   all the time. You pay your water bill you can shower anytime, there's water</br>   all the time. You pay your electricity bill, you have light all month. Over</br>   here, if your gas tank run out or this and that, there's... It's a</br>   different way of living. Over there, it's more comfortable, you live</br>   better, and the money lasts a little longer. Like I've seen families, when</br>   I was over there, families that would come from here and they would all get</br>   to work. And in six months, they would have a car, they would have their</br>   apartments, they would already be moving up.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you have an 8-year-old.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, his name is Jacob Isaiah.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="062198f7-d7dc-43ca-9b71-fa9db7db0cbd" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Drugs, Taking, Addiction">Anne: So, you have an ex-partner?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes. But she tell him… She's really bad, I hope she gets better. She<br>
   has schizophrenia because she used to smoke crystal meth. I used to smoke<br>
   crystal meth. But one day, as a crazy person, just me in the alley, I spoke<br>
   to somebody upstairs and I told them, “You know what, I'm tired of this. I<br>
   said I'm hurting my parents, I'm hurting my life, so—&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How old were you when you were doing all this?<br>

   was really hard. One of my brother's is kind of crazy from that. My baby<br>
   mama too. She's schizophrenic, she gets paid a monthly—<br>

I</br>   was in, it’s called, Gate Excel for Diligent Students back in 90 something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Gifted and talented?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, for the <span id="44103897-84db-471f-95b2-3418e15cf1c8" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TYPO">diligent gifted and talented.</span><span id="59ec0f81-3aff-459e-af28-3dfb7d49aa6d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="needs commas">diligent gifted and talented.</span><span id="e1321261-0035-4475-9576-2c4e1341f955" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Gangs, California">Hugo: Yeah. So that's why we moved but when we moved to Long Beach, it's<br>
   like there's still gang activity but just between more races. There's<br>
   Asians, there's some more Caucasians, it's everything. Long Beach is a very<br>
   multiracial community. There's a lot of Cambodians. There's everything. So,<br>
   there's more races, there's more gangs, you know? And there's a lot of<br>
   races.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="5162f4e7-f5ff-4793-b317-5933432784f4" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Migration from Mexico, Border crossing, California">So, then my dad took us, but the way he took us<br>
   was in the airplane. Back in the day, since we're kids, you would just go<br>
   as somebody else's kids.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: So, they just convinced us to say Daddy to some—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Random person?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah. And they flew us over for a low low price. Back in the day it<br>
   was cheaper and safe because we were going in the airplane, you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Sure. You went just to L.A.? Went through customs, and there you<br>
   were.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, straight to L.A.</span> And then we got to East L.A. and then from</br>   there—we lived there for a little bit—and then we moved to Long Beach.</br>   Supposedly because it was less violent. It's the same thing, you know? Just</br>   more races involved. Like in East LA we had nothing but Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mexicans, right.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: It's mostly Mexicans. There's a part of there, Salvadorians and a</br>   little bit of African American people, but mainly it's like little Mexico</br>   and shit. But there's a lot of gang activity and it's between the same</br>   race. I mean we would have to duck for cover sometimes when we would hear</br>   people running by because we lived on the street that separated the</br>   neighborhoods. So, this is one neighborhood, and this is another one.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, they would go back and forth?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah. So that's why we moved but when we moved to Long Beach, it's</br>   like there's still gang activity but just between more races. There's</br>   Asians, there's some more Caucasians, it's everything. Long Beach is a very</br>   multiracial community. There's a lot of Cambodians. There's everything. So,</br>   there's more races, there's more gangs, you know? And there's a lot of</br>   races.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I can imagine.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Like I remember when we were growing up in elementary, you have your</br>   black friends, you have your Asian friends, you have your white friends and</br>   everything's cool. But once you start getting to middle school, or the end</br>   of middle school, or high school, you start noticing things and they start</br>   letting you know about stuff. And once you hit jail or juvey it's over.</br>   It's racism full blast, you know? I mean people that I grew up with, they</br>   were not like my enemies, but we couldn't, you know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you hung with the Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Well I hung with everybody. But once you hit jail, you can't hang.</br>   You can talk to them, but you just can't share food, you can't do certain</br>   things.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: But I've never been racist in my life because I had black girlfriends</br>   and one or another different races.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, in elementary school, you say everything was good?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, it starts happening before you can get out of middle school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you like school back then?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I was in AVID [Advancement Via Individual Determination] program for</br>   diligent students, they skipped me a grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Skipped a grade?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, I wasn't bad in school, I just missed a lot and my decisions. I</br>   was in, it’s called, Gate Excel for Diligent Students back in 90 something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Gifted and talented?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, for the diligent gifted and talented. And I got in trouble, and</br>   they sent me to another school, and they put in the AVID program, that was</br>   also for the advanced. They used to take us to Cal State Long Beach to see</br>   what we would be looking into.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, it was just my decisions that took me out of where I was headed</br>   to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when did you first get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Middle school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Middle school. And when did you—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Ditching. It's because I would always hang out with the older people</br>   since I always looked older. I was in middle school going to high school,</br>   ditching, parties, and you know messing around with high school girls and</br>   all of that stuff. And that's when you run into the police. They would take</br>   me to truancy center when I would ditch sometimes, and they would catch us.</br>   Things like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do any sports or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: No. I didn't so sports. They wanted me to play football. There was a</br>   Samoan coach. They're really good at all that. And they would always tell</br>   me, &quot;Hugo, you're wasting your time, man, stop being on the streets. Let's</br>   play football.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: But again, my decisions, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think, was it because of your home life that you decided to do</br>   these—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: The thing is my parents never... I don't think my parents did wrong;</br>   they were just unaware of the way of life over there. My dad worked all</br>   day. I never seen my dad drunk, smoke weed, do any drug, hit my mother,</br>   abuse her verbally, nothing. If my mom had a dream of him kissing a girl 30</br>   years ago, she would wake up mad with him and my dad would be, &quot;Babe, I</br>   don't want to argue.&quot; He'd grab his newspaper and go into the bathroom. And</br>   I've never seen him do anything that they would be like, “Oh that's why I</br>   do this.” No. But he always had work. And my mom didn't know a lot, they</br>   didn't know, and my mom didn't really understand people, so it was hard for</br>   them to guide us. Right now, my two youngest brothers that live over there,</br>   that were born there, my parents got them good. [Snaps]. They know how to</br>   guide them. They're both college-bound, university-bound. One of them is</br>   about to graduate, today as a matter of fact, from Poly High School.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, that's great.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And the other one's already going to City College, right there in</br>   Long Beach too. And we always give them advice. I mean, aside from them</br>   seeing the result of our choices, I always tell them, “You know mom and dad</br>   tell you stay in school, don't do this, don't do that, it might seem boring</br>   at the moment, but it's for your good. Where do you see us?” I tell them,</br>   “If I would have listened to mom since little, since I was your guys age or</br>   smaller, we would have had a nice home over there and maybe a pool in the</br>   backyard. We would have already applied for the Dream act, DACA, all of</br>   it.” And since I wasn't dumb in school, I mean I could have made it far,</br>   but my decisions, no? And so, I always tell them that. And they're like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, it's a little boring, but yes, we understand.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And they would see when the cops would get there, because sometimes</br>   we would fight. We would do dumb things. They didn't stay with the</br>   curiosity of trying to be us. They seen all negative things happen from</br>   what we were doing, from our decisions. Thank God, at least that helped</br>   out, no? I mean, for them. So that's what I tell them, “The parties, the</br>   women, all the things that you guys think about, when you're a doctor, when</br>   you're an engineer, when you've already done your thing, it's still going</br>   to be there. And when you guys go to the university, you guys are going to</br>   have fun.” I tell them that I wish I would have gone to the university</br>   because that was one of my biggest things that I wanted to do, but I messed</br>   up. So, I tell them, “Take advantage, go through life for real, enjoy the</br>   real life. You guys are born there, you guys have all the odds in your</br>   favor.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's right.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: “You guys have parents that love you. My parents don't drink, my</br>   parents don't abuse you guys, my parents really care for you. What more do</br>   you guys want? I know you might think that life right now, it's boring—”</br>   because they live where it's a high crime area and things like that. But,</br>   once they move up, and once they get to be where they have to be, I tell</br>   them, “You guys are going to enjoy your life once you have your big house</br>   in the hills. When you know, things or different things or once you live a</br>   little bit better, you guys are going to enjoy all that and you're going to</br>   thank mom and dad.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when did you first go to juvey? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I was 14. The thing is when you grow up and you feel like you were</br>   born there—my dad used to tell us, &quot;I don't know you guys are in the street</br>   all day. I mean you guys have your home here, you can eat whenever you</br>   want, you can shower whenever you want, listen to music whenever you want.&quot;</br>   But that was boring to us. So, we would go into the street. There was three</br>   of us. Three brothers. And we'd go into the street, kick it in the alleys,</br>   you know like people do over there.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: We started hanging with certain people, you know? And things</br>   happened, they come around with G-rides, stolen cars, things like that. And</br>   it seems easy for you to take a joy ride, “Oh we'll take it over there to</br>   certain people's houses.” You get caught up. That's the first time I got</br>   caught. I didn't steal the car. Somebody came by, I took it, but it was a</br>   stolen car. I knew what I was doing, so they locked me up for grand theft</br>   auto or receiving stolen property or what not.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long were you—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Not long, a few months.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your parents must have been upset.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Oh yes. My parents don't like none of that. They've always taught us,</br>   they say, “We go into somebody's home and you see a penny, you don't touch</br>   that penny. You don't do that.” My dad, the first time he seen my smoking</br>   weed, he smacked me. I heard the ding. Like I said, I'd never seen my dad</br>   drunk, I'd never seen my dad do any drugs, but I kind of liked it, so. I</br>   mean they showed us well. It was just… I don't know why. I don't know why</br>   we didn't take advantage of being over there. Now that I think about it, I</br>   wasted a lot of opportunity, but I mean all you can do is work at it now,</br>   you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. You got to move forward.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, like right now, I don't do nothing. I don't even consider no</br>   illegal activity, nothing. For what? I'm going to get busted here and,</br>   here, it's way worse. And aside from that, I did learn from my experience</br>   over there. If you don't learn from your life experience, then you must be</br>   really either really stupid or I don't know what. You know? Like a lot of</br>   people that come back over here get deported, they still continue to hustle</br>   here and try to do this and that. I mean, didn't you learn from your other</br>   experience? And that's where I'm right now.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I've had ideas that there's some type of programs or something that</br>   might help all people trying to go back and that would be awesome because</br>   it would all be legal. And what I'm working on is, if in case an</br>   opportunity comes up like that, I can show my past ten years: I've been a</br>   productive member of society or the community or what not, and no illegal</br>   activity, no bad, no ill will toward anyone, just working, having my</br>   family, doing my thing. What I have to do, you know? I have my license. I</br>   have my car. I pay my rent.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: But life here is different. Over there, you don't have to worry about</br>   a gas tank going out on you. You pay your gas bill and you have your gas</br>   all the time. You pay your water bill you can shower anytime, there's water</br>   all the time. You pay your electricity bill, you have light all month. Over</br>   here, if your gas tank run out or this and that, there's... It's a</br>   different way of living. Over there, it's more comfortable, you live</br>   better, and the money lasts a little longer. Like I've seen families, when</br>   I was over there, families that would come from here and they would all get</br>   to work. And in six months, they would have a car, they would have their</br>   apartments, they would already be moving up.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you have an 8-year-old.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, his name is Jacob Isaiah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you have an ex-partner?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. But she tell him… She's really bad, I hope she gets better. She</br>   has schizophrenia because she used to smoke crystal meth. I used to smoke</br>   crystal meth. But one day, as a crazy person, just me in the alley, I spoke</br>   to somebody upstairs and I told them, “You know what, I'm tired of this. I</br>   said I'm hurting my parents, I'm hurting my life, so—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you when you were doing all this?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Like 18, 19. Oh, I started at like 14, I stopped at 19, 20. But it</br>   was really hard. One of my brother's is kind of crazy from that. My baby</br>   mama too. She's schizophrenic, she gets paid a monthly—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, some sort of social security for disability.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, because she cannot work. And my little kid has gone through all</br>   that, you know? And he's a teacher's pet, he's super smart, he's reading at</br>   a 5th grade level and he's in 3rd grade. They had a little reading contest,</br>   he beat the 5th grader.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: He got the best of me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And do your parents help him out?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. Whenever they can, they go and take him, and they buy him food.</br>   Last time, I sent them five pairs of shoes, a gang of pants, nice shirts,</br>   nice sweaters. So, he knows I'm there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good. Do you get to talk to him much?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, I do. I talk to him almost every day. I have him on WhatsApp.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have a picture?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. I just sent him a boat on Amazon, because he wanted a boat. Look</br>   this is the video.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He's so cute. Is it remote control?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That is so cool.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: It was around $200 but he really wanted it, so whatever I can do for</br>   my boy for him to feel I'm there, I will do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That is amazing. Wow. It better come back.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: It does. Yeah, it's a long range. It wasn't $200 for nothing.</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Let me show you a picture. But that's my Jacob. So, my parents,</br>   they've always kept me alive with him, and I always try to call. And I</br>   always video chat with him. I video chatted with him like two days ago.</br>   Because I'm planning on him coming for his vacation. He should be getting</br>   out of school in like seven days.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, so he'll come for the summer?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Hopefully, because last time his grandmother told me that he was</br>   going to come, I was about to buy the tickets, and then at the last minute,</br>   she said, “No, he's too small,” this and that, and they lied to me. They</br>   made me think that he was going to come and that didn't happen, but it's</br>   okay. We'll try it again this year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It will happen. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Look, this is my son. This is my son. That's him right there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh my goodness, he's adorable.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, he's a teacher's pet. He helps out the teacher with the Spanish</br>   speakers, all of that. So, he got the best of both of us. He's very smart.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's amazing. Tell me about the final thing that got you deported</br>   for your first deportation.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: The weed ticket?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it was possession of weed.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes, I went to juvey a few times, correct?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I went to Camp Gonzalez in Malibu. Calabasas Road, really nice over</br>   there. They have nice houses. I came out, I turned 18 in camp, in juvenile</br>   camp, right? So, the judge told me, &quot;If I see you again, you're going to be</br>   an adult and if I see you again, you know you were not born here, so you</br>   will be facing deportation.&quot; When I got out of camp, I was what? 18? And</br>   that's when I had my kid around there. And so, I stopped messing around. I</br>   started working as a security officer without a guard card—you know, under</br>   the table. They would pay me like 10 something and then after certain</br>   hours, they would pay me a little bit more. It was funny because I used to</br>   be bad or I would do bad decisions so when people would see me with a</br>   special security officer badge and looking like a cop, they'd be like,</br>   &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm trying to feed my kid, you can shut up</br>   and keep going.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And then I had a marijuana ticket. They stopped me, I had some</br>   marijuana, they gave me a ticket. A ticket that I could go do community</br>   service or that I could go pay $100, $200 fine whatever—it's not illegal in</br>   the States, in California. And one day before going to work, I was in the</br>   stroller with my kid, and my ex-baby mama, my ex-lady. We crossed the light</br>   walking, a red light, right? But this street is empty. And there happened</br>   to be a cop passing by. So, he pulls us over when we're pushing my baby in</br>   the stroller, when there's dead traffic, no traffic at all. He was</br>   Hispanic, he was Latino, his last name was Ramirez. And I'm like, I did get</br>   a little, you know, &quot;What? What are you stopping me for?&quot; &quot;Because you seen</br>   that I seen you crossing and you smiled at me. You laughed at me.&quot; “Ah, so</br>   you're stopping me because of your feelings?” You can't tell a cop that</br>   because oh my God, that's it, it's over.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, he's like, &quot;Look I'm going to run your name and if you have</br>   anything, I'm going to take you, this and that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Man why didn't</br>   you go to get somebody that's actually doing something? You see me with my</br>   baby and my baby mama, what do you think I'm doing? You think I'm up to no</br>   good or what? I'm about to go to work in a few hours. Why you messing with</br>   me? Go get somebody that's actually doing something.&quot; So, I shouldn't have</br>   run my mouth, but he could have not taken me. And he ran my name and he's</br>   like, &quot;Oh, you have a warrant for your arrest&quot;—$5,000 or something. Which</br>   is nothing. If the warrants are from $40,000 and under, they can decide to</br>   let you go, to pay a fine, to do community service. They can decide to not</br>   take you in. Because it's not even something big. It could have been fixed</br>   with me paying or community service.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, I didn't get more mad, I realized there was a warrant, and then I</br>   went off on him. He was going to take me, so I softened up, and I was like,</br>   &quot;You know what? I'm about to go to work, I'm the man of the house, my wife</br>   doesn't work, I have to pay the bills. I got to go. Don't take me in. You</br>   know I can fix that in court.&quot; &quot;No, no, no. For being a loudmouth, I'm</br>   going to take you in.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;You know I've got an ICE hold because</br>   it shows there. If you take me in for that, they're going to deport me.&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Who's going to take care of my family?&quot; He was like, &quot;Well</br>   you should have thought of that when you ran your mouth.&quot; And I was like,</br>   &quot;Well you have the decision of letting me go and I can fix this with a</br>   payment or anything, but you're going to mess up my family. I'm going to</br>   get deported.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And I told him, &quot;Man, you're Mexican, you're Hispanic, you might be</br>   the first, second, third, generation, but I bet your people before that</br>   weren't. Think about that shit man.&quot; He still took me. I went in. And like</br>   36 hours later, no 24, almost a day and a half, only the time that it takes</br>   to process in and process out, that's how I paid my sentence. 15 days,</br>   which is, you do 10% of 15 days, how much time is it? Nothing. In and out.</br>   But on the way out, you're getting dressed and everything and ICE is</br>   already there &quot;You've been in jail a few times and you've never seen ICE?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Well no.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, they're like, &quot;Where were you born?&quot; This and that. And that's</br>   it, they took me. And that's where I went to the immigration library and I</br>   started looking at the different things that you can apply for.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, for three months, you were there?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Because I wanted to see how I can stay there. And it was in</br>   Lancaster. Well at the end, I got the voluntary departure. And I was</br>   supposed to get out of the country, in two years marry my ex, marry her in</br>   Mexico, and with her ask for a pardon.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: She's a U.S. citizen. And her daddy used to tell me, &quot;Just get</br>   married already. She has papers.&quot; But I was like, &quot;No. It's because I don't</br>   just want to do it just for the papers, you know? I want to buy her a</br>   little ring, do a little something.” But so, that's what happened, so then</br>   that's how I got deported. It wasn't even like I did something major or</br>   anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, that's crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I mean I know when I was younger, I did receive stolen property, I</br>   did make bad decisions, but that's all involved with drug abuse and use.</br>   It's not like, I woke up and I said, “I'm going to go steal a car.” No, I</br>   was making bad decisions, you know, dumb stuff. It's not like any other</br>   Americans never did it. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Any Americans, regardless of their race, you know? And that's what</br>   happened. So, I'm working for a juvenile record and marijuana ticket as an</br>   adult.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then how long where you in Mexico before you tried to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: About a year. 11 months, almost a year. And then my father was going</br>   to help me, he was going to pay for the coyote—$4,000-$5,000. But it’s</br>   okay, if you don't cross, you don't pay, so it's okay. They didn't spend</br>   the money or anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you got caught at the border?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, I got caught at the border. So, then they were going to send me</br>   out back to TJ. Which I wanted; I would have just tried to cross.</br>   Unfortunately, that's what I would have tried to do. Because my son was</br>   over there. My girl lost her apartment, she had to sell our big California</br>   king bed that we had—I'm not worried about the bed, I just thought it was</br>   cool. But my baby—well not this baby, but my first born. She lost the</br>   apartment, she started selling the furniture because she didn't have no</br>   money, and she couldn't work, she had the baby. Things like that. So, my</br>   dad my was like, &quot;Okay come on.&quot; But yeah, that's what happened. 11 months,</br>   almost a year, I tried to go back, went to county. Well they give you state</br>   time, they give you state prison time, but since the prisons are packed,</br>   you do it in county, which is a little bit worse.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, it's worse?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Nobody wants to be in the county. Because you're sleeping next to a</br>   guy that doesn't know how much time he's going to do. So, it's not like</br>   you're scared, but there's kids that are crying because they are doing 2, 3</br>   years when the guy above you is facing 80 years to life. You better shut</br>   your mouth. You're going to get something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so, you were there for a year and then came back?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: A year and then 3 months in a detention. Oh, the last time, yes. No,</br>   the last time, I just got deported right after the... And that was it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then you decided lets—</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Well not that I decided, I wanted to go right back. But my father was</br>   like... Because the first time I got deported, I stayed in Mexicali, so I</br>   never met my grandparents, none of them, I didn't see any of my aunties,</br>   uncles, or anything. So, my dad is like, &quot;Well this time you should go meet</br>   the family. You're going to be there three months.” But it's been six</br>   years, you know? So, he's like, “Go meet the family,” this and that. And</br>   so, I went to HIldago, that's where I met my grandpa. My grandfather, he's</br>   the man. I told my father, if I would have stayed here with my grandparents</br>   or my grandfather, I think I would have been way better off. I would have</br>   had a business or something. My grandfather knows how to cook bread. He</br>   knows how to construction. He's a mechanic and he's a farmer. So, I mean he</br>   doesn't have land, like a lot of land, but he gave every single one of his</br>   kid’s land, a little piece at least. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And he's the humblest person ever. I think I got some of his traits.</br>   He's no bull, he's good. He's an awesome person and he's 89 right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow. Well you got his brains. So, what do you miss about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: My family and the lifestyle. If I ever went back to the States, I</br>   wouldn't want to go back to Los Angeles. I wouldn't want to go there</br>   because of all the movement, people that I know. It's not like I'm going to</br>   go and make bad decisions. But, it's too hard. I want to be somewhere</br>   where's there not a lot of people. Maybe out of the city, you know? I</br>   wouldn't mind country living or anything like that because it's peaceful.</br>   Like when I go to visit my grandparents, it's a small town, you can take a</br>   deep breath of fresh air. Not like here. When we go over there to visit or</br>   like I took my baby, so she could meet her grandad and all the aunties and</br>   everything, and me and my girl didn't want to come back. We were just like,</br>   you know…But we have to come back and work. And over there, there's no call</br>   centers or anything like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What were your dreams when you were in the US? And what are your</br>   dreams now? Have they changed?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I wanted to be an architect and help my mom and my dad. Because my</br>   dad works a lot. And he's always up to something. But, bad decisions, you</br>   know? Like it feels good when you send them money from here, like from here</br>   we send them money. Other people they would say all your kids, your family,</br>   is the one that hits you hardest sometimes. My uncles and aunties they had</br>   their kids doing good and everything, &quot;Oh look at your kids, they're pieces</br>   of shit. They go to jail and they smoke, and this and that.&quot; And now that</br>   we're helping them out from here, it's like, nobody says nothing.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: One of my uncles, he's really really... I don't like him because he</br>   thinks he's the best and this and that. And one day I got home from work</br>   from the butchery or whatever, tired and I wanted to drink a beer. So, I</br>   put some music low and I was drinking a beer. And he had a whole case of</br>   beer upstairs himself. And, &quot;Why you drinking beer? You can't be</br>   disrespecting the house.&quot; I was like, &quot;Look Uncle, I'm not a kid. And you</br>   can't tell me anything. I just got here from work, I'm drinking a beer, and</br>   I have my music low. Don't get me fucked up, Uncle.&quot; I'm sorry for the bad</br>   words. &quot;I'm not a kid and you're not nobody to tell me anything. Who am I</br>   disrespecting?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And ever since that day, I was like, “Don't get it twisted Uncle.”</br>   You know? And I was like, &quot;You have your beer, what's the difference?&quot; And</br>   after that…I think it's because they had the picture of us all twisted, you</br>   know? We've made bad decisions, but we ain't bad people. We're not trash.</br>   We're nothing like that. I have values. I know how it is to live. I know</br>   what's the right way. How you are supposed to do it. And family is the main</br>   thing. At least to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And that's your dream?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. I still think of all that. I mean, right now, my parents</br>   probably be helped out with... My little brother's growing up, but we can</br>   help out too. Because my dad, he has diabetes. My mom does too. And my</br>   mom's one of them holy ladies that, “Jesus Christ, I have nothing, Jesus</br>   Christ will heal me.” I'm like, &quot;Yes, Jesus Christ will heal you, but take</br>   your medicine, take care of yourself.&quot; She was just in the hospital a month</br>   ago, in and out, and I kept telling her, &quot;Man, I believe your religion,</br>   Mother, pray to your Jesus, but take care of yourself too.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're a good son.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And she would always tell us that she was good, but she didn't tell</br>   us that... She would just tell us that she was good. But now I tell her,</br>   &quot;How good are you?&quot; Because my dad tells us, &quot;When she tells you she's</br>   good, she's not really good.&quot; And now she laughs, she's like, &quot;Okay, I feel</br>   this or that.&quot; And she's more honest with us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you had some ideas about programs to help returning</br>   migrants either to adjust here or to get back to the States. What were your</br>   ideas?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Well I don't know. Like at work sometimes, they apply for visas and</br>   stuff like that, but I don't know if its related to any programs of trying</br>   to go back or anything. But regardless of that, all I know if there was</br>   something like that, you would have to show that you've been doing</br>   something good for a while.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And that's what you're doing.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yes. I'm taking care of mine. I'm doing what I'm supposed to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Has life been okay in Mexico in the last six months?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Yeah, I mean it's okay, it's just you struggle way more. They don't</br>   take care of anything here, like government wise. I don't want my baby to</br>   be in a school. When we had Ilene over here, my stepdaughter, which is my</br>   daughter to the fullest—I don't even call her my stepdaughter. First, she</br>   didn't like me because my fiancé right now, her previous relationship was</br>   bad. The guy used to beat her up. And I might be a tough guy, but you don't</br>   touch a woman. And my dad made that clear to us. He said, &quot;The day you guys</br>   lift a finger to your mom, you're going to know who I am.&quot; Never</br>   disrespected my mom. And nobody either around the neighborhood, because</br>   they seen three big guys, &quot;Oh that's your sons? Those are your kids?&quot;</br>   &quot;Yeah, yeah, that's my mom right there.&quot; And it's different out here, but</br>   it's a little bit harder.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: So, she had her previous relationship and Ilene, she was born over</br>   there, but this girl came to follow this dumb ass that used to beat her up,</br>   that abandoned them when she was born. You know? But that's how we met, so,</br>   things happen. God works in mysterious ways, they say around there, you</br>   know? But he used to beat her up and he used to treat her bad and</br>   disrespected her and Ilene had that idea in her head.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: You know when she moved in with me, I never hit her, I never talked</br>   to her bad, but I would explain the things to her. I would grab her when</br>   she would be telling her mom that she was fat or ugly or things like that.</br>   And I'd be like, &quot;Ilene, come here please. I'm not your father miha. But</br>   I'm going to let you know what's right and wrong. And I don't care if you</br>   get mad or you cry, but you're going to listen to me. What does your mother</br>   do every day? Go to work. And why do you think she goes to work?” “To feed</br>   me.” “Why else? Do you need anything when you ask us for something, do we</br>   not provide it if its needed?” I will teach her with, prove her with</br>   things. I'd be like, “You can't talk to your mom like that. Your mom loves</br>   you.” I'm like, “When does your mom tell you that you're ugly or when does</br>   she make you feel bad?” I'm like, “How do you think she feels when you tell</br>   her that?” I'm like, “No, no, no.”</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And the first times, she would just stay quiet. And then sometimes,</br>   she would get really angry and she would hit me with that, &quot;You're not my</br>   dad.&quot; It's nothing, I know it's normal. And then after months, “Oh he's</br>   mine,” that I was all hers and then she told me if she could call me papi,</br>   if she can call me her dad. You can call me whatever you want miha. But the</br>   way she addresses her mom? Completely different.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's tough.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I educated her on why she shouldn't treat her mom a certain way, what</br>   her mother does for her.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think living in the US made you a different person than you</br>   would've been if you stayed here?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Not really a different person. Just noticed different types of</br>   lifestyles and pretty much it. How people are because you can be here the</br>   same as you are anywhere. I think if I was placed in any place, even in</br>   Mars, I would still be the same person. You know? I just went through</br>   certain decisions that obviously gets you consequences. But the States is</br>   just more comfortable.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: We've been thinking about Canada too. Different things because right</br>   here to live in the States, you either have to be a political asshole, I'm</br>   sorry, or somebody that does things that they're not supposed to do.</br>   There's a saying here that says, he who doesn't swindle or do something</br>   doesn't advance. And if you're not the nephew or niece of a fucking</br>   political mother fucker position, you can't get it. I mean if you study</br>   hard and you do your thing, you can get to certain places. Or if you really</br>   work hard, you'll live better. But you really have to work for it. It's not</br>   as simple as in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: And like all the government stuff over here, in the city it's a</br>   little bit better, but like over there in the hills, like I was saying</br>   about Ilene. One time we took her to school, and we used to pay 150 pesos</br>   for them to pick her up. But she's born in the States and she doesn't have</br>   a CURP (Mexican ID), and they would always bother her that she needed to</br>   bring those papers. And that's why we were going to the school, because</br>   they're not supposed to bother her. They can't deny her education. And I</br>   know that, I'm not dumb. So, we went over there, and it happened to be the</br>   same day the teacher missed, so the teacher missed and they're like, &quot;All</br>   you kids go home.&quot; And I'm like—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where's the substitute?</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: I'm like, &quot;I'm sorry, what do you mean go home? Didn't they just get</br>   brought here on the transportation? How do you know they're going to get</br>   home safe? So, if wouldn't have brought my daughter right now, your ass</br>   would have sent her home alone, when she's nine years old, how do you</br>   guarantee she was going to get to the house safe?&quot; And I got mad. &quot;Oh, it's</br>   because we don't have a substitute.&quot; So then why don't you guys split the</br>   class, and nobody goes home? How are you going to send everybody home?” I</br>   mean they didn't listen to me. And I was like, “No man, I don't like this,</br>   they don't have libraries with good... “People still make it, but they</br>   really really have to want to do it and really have to push for it.</br>   Especially in the hills. Where we live, it's kind of ugly. But that's where</br>   we are for now. But we'll see what we can do, my baby? Get you out of them</br>   hills.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well it seems like you're doing a great job of it.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: We're trying at least, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And working hard and hopefully there'll be a time you can go back and</br>   see the rest of your family.</br> </br> </br>   Hugo: Hopefully.</br> </div><\p>
