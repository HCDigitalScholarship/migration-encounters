        <div class="content">
            <p><p><br>
   Anne: Tell me a little bit about the circumstances behind your initial<br>
   migration to the United States. You were three you said?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And your dad—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: My dad started working in the U.S., right? Because back in the day<br>
   you can cross easier and well in the towns, even in that day, like I<br>
   mentioned, you make less money. Even if you work hard, you make less money.<br>
   You have to own a business or do something to come up. And he went to the<br>
   States, we were living okay, but my mother didn't like that he was over<br>
   here all the time and then sometimes he would just come. So, her little<br>
   light bulb went off and she said, "Either you take all of us, or I don't<br>
   know, you know? I know you send me money and I know you come from time to<br>
   time, but that's not it. I want to be with you."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And there were three of you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Three of us. And my mom—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Three boys?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes, three boys. She wanted a girl so, she tried with my oldest<br>
   brother Luis, he came out a boy, then me, I came out a boy, and then Tony,<br>
   the other one that's here in Mexico too, and then after that they waited<br>
   around ten years, eight, ten, years. And that's when, once in the States,<br>
   they had Junior and Moses. When she had Moses, another boy, and then she<br>
   waited another year and a half and we told her, "Try mom, try it." She<br>
   really wanted a girl. This is her first girl, she's crazy over her.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's great. [Laughs].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: That's what happened. So, then my dad took us, but the way he took us<br>
   was in the airplane. Back in the day, since we're kids, you would just go<br>
   as somebody else's kids.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: So, they just convinced us to say Daddy to some—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Random person?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah. And they flew us over for a low low price. Back in the day it<br>
   was cheaper and safe because we were going in the airplane, you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Sure. You went just to L.A.? Went through customs, and there you<br>
   were.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, straight to L.A. And then we got to East L.A. and then from<br>
   there—we lived there for a little bit—and then we moved to Long Beach.<br>
   Supposedly because it was less violent. It's the same thing, you know? Just<br>
   more races involved. Like in East LA we had nothing but Mexicans.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Mexicans, right.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: It's mostly Mexicans. There's a part of there, Salvadorians and a<br>
   little bit of African American people, but mainly it's like little Mexico<br>
   and shit. But there's a lot of gang activity and it's between the same<br>
   race. I mean we would have to duck for cover sometimes when we would hear<br>
   people running by because we lived on the street that separated the<br>
   neighborhoods. So, this is one neighborhood, and this is another one.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, they would go back and forth?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah. So that's why we moved but when we moved to Long Beach, it's<br>
   like there's still gang activity but just between more races. There's<br>
   Asians, there's some more Caucasians, it's everything. Long Beach is a very<br>
   multiracial community. There's a lot of Cambodians. There's everything. So,<br>
   there's more races, there's more gangs, you know? And there's a lot of<br>
   races.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I can imagine.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Like I remember when we were growing up in elementary, you have your<br>
   black friends, you have your Asian friends, you have your white friends and<br>
   everything's cool. But once you start getting to middle school, or the end<br>
   of middle school, or high school, you start noticing things and they start<br>
   letting you know about stuff. And once you hit jail or juvey it's over.<br>
   It's racism full blast, you know? I mean people that I grew up with, they<br>
   were not like my enemies, but we couldn't, you know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you hung with the Mexicans?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Well I hung with everybody. But once you hit jail, you can't hang.<br>
   You can talk to them, but you just can't share food, you can't do certain<br>
   things.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: But I've never been racist in my life because I had black girlfriends<br>
   and one or another different races.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, in elementary school, you say everything was good?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, it starts happening before you can get out of middle school.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And did you like school back then?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: I was in AVID [Advancement Via Individual Determination] program for<br>
   diligent students, they skipped me a grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Skipped a grade?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, I wasn't bad in school, I just missed a lot and my decisions. I<br>
   was in, it’s called, Gate Excel for Diligent Students back in 90 something.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Gifted and talented?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes, for the diligent gifted and talented. And I got in trouble, and<br>
   they sent me to another school, and they put in the AVID program, that was<br>
   also for the advanced. They used to take us to Cal State Long Beach to see<br>
   what we would be looking into.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: I see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: So, it was just my decisions that took me out of where I was headed<br>
   to.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, when did you first get in trouble?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Middle school.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Middle school. And when did you—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Ditching. It's because I would always hang out with the older people<br>
   since I always looked older. I was in middle school going to high school,<br>
   ditching, parties, and you know messing around with high school girls and<br>
   all of that stuff. And that's when you run into the police. They would take<br>
   me to truancy center when I would ditch sometimes, and they would catch us.<br>
   Things like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Did you do any sports or anything like that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: No. I didn't so sports. They wanted me to play football. There was a<br>
   Samoan coach. They're really good at all that. And they would always tell<br>
   me, "Hugo, you're wasting your time, man, stop being on the streets. Let's<br>
   play football."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: But again, my decisions, you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Do you think, was it because of your home life that you decided to do<br>
   these—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: The thing is my parents never... I don't think my parents did wrong;<br>
   they were just unaware of the way of life over there. My dad worked all<br>
   day. I never seen my dad drunk, smoke weed, do any drug, hit my mother,<br>
   abuse her verbally, nothing. If my mom had a dream of him kissing a girl 30<br>
   years ago, she would wake up mad with him and my dad would be, "Babe, I<br>
   don't want to argue." He'd grab his newspaper and go into the bathroom. And<br>
   I've never seen him do anything that they would be like, “Oh that's why I<br>
   do this.” No. But he always had work. And my mom didn't know a lot, they<br>
   didn't know, and my mom didn't really understand people, so it was hard for<br>
   them to guide us. Right now, my two youngest brothers that live over there,<br>
   that were born there, my parents got them good. [Snaps]. They know how to<br>
   guide them. They're both college-bound, university-bound. One of them is<br>
   about to graduate, today as a matter of fact, from Poly High School.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Oh, that's great.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And the other one's already going to City College, right there in<br>
   Long Beach too. And we always give them advice. I mean, aside from them<br>
   seeing the result of our choices, I always tell them, “You know mom and dad<br>
   tell you stay in school, don't do this, don't do that, it might seem boring<br>
   at the moment, but it's for your good. Where do you see us?” I tell them,<br>
   “If I would have listened to mom since little, since I was your guys age or<br>
   smaller, we would have had a nice home over there and maybe a pool in the<br>
   backyard. We would have already applied for the Dream act, DACA, all of<br>
   it.” And since I wasn't dumb in school, I mean I could have made it far,<br>
   but my decisions, no? And so, I always tell them that. And they're like,<br>
   "Yeah, it's a little boring, but yes, we understand."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And they would see when the cops would get there, because sometimes<br>
   we would fight. We would do dumb things. They didn't stay with the<br>
   curiosity of trying to be us. They seen all negative things happen from<br>
   what we were doing, from our decisions. Thank God, at least that helped<br>
   out, no? I mean, for them. So that's what I tell them, “The parties, the<br>
   women, all the things that you guys think about, when you're a doctor, when<br>
   you're an engineer, when you've already done your thing, it's still going<br>
   to be there. And when you guys go to the university, you guys are going to<br>
   have fun.” I tell them that I wish I would have gone to the university<br>
   because that was one of my biggest things that I wanted to do, but I messed<br>
   up. So, I tell them, “Take advantage, go through life for real, enjoy the<br>
   real life. You guys are born there, you guys have all the odds in your<br>
   favor.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's right.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: “You guys have parents that love you. My parents don't drink, my<br>
   parents don't abuse you guys, my parents really care for you. What more do<br>
   you guys want? I know you might think that life right now, it's boring—”<br>
   because they live where it's a high crime area and things like that. But,<br>
   once they move up, and once they get to be where they have to be, I tell<br>
   them, “You guys are going to enjoy your life once you have your big house<br>
   in the hills. When you know, things or different things or once you live a<br>
   little bit better, you guys are going to enjoy all that and you're going to<br>
   thank mom and dad.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, when did you first go to juvey? How old were you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: I was 14. The thing is when you grow up and you feel like you were<br>
   born there—my dad used to tell us, "I don't know you guys are in the street<br>
   all day. I mean you guys have your home here, you can eat whenever you<br>
   want, you can shower whenever you want, listen to music whenever you want."<br>
   But that was boring to us. So, we would go into the street. There was three<br>
   of us. Three brothers. And we'd go into the street, kick it in the alleys,<br>
   you know like people do over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: We started hanging with certain people, you know? And things<br>
   happened, they come around with G-rides, stolen cars, things like that. And<br>
   it seems easy for you to take a joy ride, “Oh we'll take it over there to<br>
   certain people's houses.” You get caught up. That's the first time I got<br>
   caught. I didn't steal the car. Somebody came by, I took it, but it was a<br>
   stolen car. I knew what I was doing, so they locked me up for grand theft<br>
   auto or receiving stolen property or what not.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How long were you—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Not long, a few months.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Your parents must have been upset.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Oh yes. My parents don't like none of that. They've always taught us,<br>
   they say, “We go into somebody's home and you see a penny, you don't touch<br>
   that penny. You don't do that.” My dad, the first time he seen my smoking<br>
   weed, he smacked me. I heard the ding. Like I said, I'd never seen my dad<br>
   drunk, I'd never seen my dad do any drugs, but I kind of liked it, so. I<br>
   mean they showed us well. It was just… I don't know why. I don't know why<br>
   we didn't take advantage of being over there. Now that I think about it, I<br>
   wasted a lot of opportunity, but I mean all you can do is work at it now,<br>
   you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Yeah. You got to move forward.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, like right now, I don't do nothing. I don't even consider no<br>
   illegal activity, nothing. For what? I'm going to get busted here and,<br>
   here, it's way worse. And aside from that, I did learn from my experience<br>
   over there. If you don't learn from your life experience, then you must be<br>
   really either really stupid or I don't know what. You know? Like a lot of<br>
   people that come back over here get deported, they still continue to hustle<br>
   here and try to do this and that. I mean, didn't you learn from your other<br>
   experience? And that's where I'm right now.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: I've had ideas that there's some type of programs or something that<br>
   might help all people trying to go back and that would be awesome because<br>
   it would all be legal. And what I'm working on is, if in case an<br>
   opportunity comes up like that, I can show my past ten years: I've been a<br>
   productive member of society or the community or what not, and no illegal<br>
   activity, no bad, no ill will toward anyone, just working, having my<br>
   family, doing my thing. What I have to do, you know? I have my license. I<br>
   have my car. I pay my rent.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's great.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: But life here is different. Over there, you don't have to worry about<br>
   a gas tank going out on you. You pay your gas bill and you have your gas<br>
   all the time. You pay your water bill you can shower anytime, there's water<br>
   all the time. You pay your electricity bill, you have light all month. Over<br>
   here, if your gas tank run out or this and that, there's... It's a<br>
   different way of living. Over there, it's more comfortable, you live<br>
   better, and the money lasts a little longer. Like I've seen families, when<br>
   I was over there, families that would come from here and they would all get<br>
   to work. And in six months, they would have a car, they would have their<br>
   apartments, they would already be moving up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you said you have an 8-year-old.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes, his name is Jacob Isaiah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you have an ex-partner?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes. But she tell him… She's really bad, I hope she gets better. She<br>
   has schizophrenia because she used to smoke crystal meth. I used to smoke<br>
   crystal meth. But one day, as a crazy person, just me in the alley, I spoke<br>
   to somebody upstairs and I told them, “You know what, I'm tired of this. I<br>
   said I'm hurting my parents, I'm hurting my life, so—"<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: How old were you when you were doing all this?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Like 18, 19. Oh, I started at like 14, I stopped at 19, 20. But it<br>
   was really hard. One of my brother's is kind of crazy from that. My baby<br>
   mama too. She's schizophrenic, she gets paid a monthly—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Oh, some sort of social security for disability.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, because she cannot work. And my little kid has gone through all<br>
   that, you know? And he's a teacher's pet, he's super smart, he's reading at<br>
   a 5th grade level and he's in 3rd grade. They had a little reading contest,<br>
   he beat the 5th grader.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: He got the best of me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And do your parents help him out?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes. Whenever they can, they go and take him, and they buy him food.<br>
   Last time, I sent them five pairs of shoes, a gang of pants, nice shirts,<br>
   nice sweaters. So, he knows I'm there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's good. Do you get to talk to him much?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, I do. I talk to him almost every day. I have him on WhatsApp.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Do you have a picture?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes. I just sent him a boat on Amazon, because he wanted a boat. Look<br>
   this is the video.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: He's so cute. Is it remote control?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That is so cool.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: It was around $200 but he really wanted it, so whatever I can do for<br>
   my boy for him to feel I'm there, I will do it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That is amazing. Wow. It better come back.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: It does. Yeah, it's a long range. It wasn't $200 for nothing.<br>
   [Chuckles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Let me show you a picture. But that's my Jacob. So, my parents,<br>
   they've always kept me alive with him, and I always try to call. And I<br>
   always video chat with him. I video chatted with him like two days ago.<br>
   Because I'm planning on him coming for his vacation. He should be getting<br>
   out of school in like seven days.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Oh, so he'll come for the summer?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Hopefully, because last time his grandmother told me that he was<br>
   going to come, I was about to buy the tickets, and then at the last minute,<br>
   she said, “No, he's too small,” this and that, and they lied to me. They<br>
   made me think that he was going to come and that didn't happen, but it's<br>
   okay. We'll try it again this year.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: It will happen. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Look, this is my son. This is my son. That's him right there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Oh my goodness, he's adorable.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, he's a teacher's pet. He helps out the teacher with the Spanish<br>
   speakers, all of that. So, he got the best of both of us. He's very smart.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's amazing. Tell me about the final thing that got you deported<br>
   for your first deportation.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: The weed ticket?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, it was possession of weed.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes, I went to juvey a few times, correct?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: I went to Camp Gonzalez in Malibu. Calabasas Road, really nice over<br>
   there. They have nice houses. I came out, I turned 18 in camp, in juvenile<br>
   camp, right? So, the judge told me, "If I see you again, you're going to be<br>
   an adult and if I see you again, you know you were not born here, so you<br>
   will be facing deportation." When I got out of camp, I was what? 18? And<br>
   that's when I had my kid around there. And so, I stopped messing around. I<br>
   started working as a security officer without a guard card—you know, under<br>
   the table. They would pay me like 10 something and then after certain<br>
   hours, they would pay me a little bit more. It was funny because I used to<br>
   be bad or I would do bad decisions so when people would see me with a<br>
   special security officer badge and looking like a cop, they'd be like,<br>
   "What are you doing?" I'm like, "I'm trying to feed my kid, you can shut up<br>
   and keep going."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And then I had a marijuana ticket. They stopped me, I had some<br>
   marijuana, they gave me a ticket. A ticket that I could go do community<br>
   service or that I could go pay $100, $200 fine whatever—it's not illegal in<br>
   the States, in California. And one day before going to work, I was in the<br>
   stroller with my kid, and my ex-baby mama, my ex-lady. We crossed the light<br>
   walking, a red light, right? But this street is empty. And there happened<br>
   to be a cop passing by. So, he pulls us over when we're pushing my baby in<br>
   the stroller, when there's dead traffic, no traffic at all. He was<br>
   Hispanic, he was Latino, his last name was Ramirez. And I'm like, I did get<br>
   a little, you know, "What? What are you stopping me for?" "Because you seen<br>
   that I seen you crossing and you smiled at me. You laughed at me." “Ah, so<br>
   you're stopping me because of your feelings?” You can't tell a cop that<br>
   because oh my God, that's it, it's over.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: So, he's like, "Look I'm going to run your name and if you have<br>
   anything, I'm going to take you, this and that." I'm like, "Man why didn't<br>
   you go to get somebody that's actually doing something? You see me with my<br>
   baby and my baby mama, what do you think I'm doing? You think I'm up to no<br>
   good or what? I'm about to go to work in a few hours. Why you messing with<br>
   me? Go get somebody that's actually doing something." So, I shouldn't have<br>
   run my mouth, but he could have not taken me. And he ran my name and he's<br>
   like, "Oh, you have a warrant for your arrest"—$5,000 or something. Which<br>
   is nothing. If the warrants are from $40,000 and under, they can decide to<br>
   let you go, to pay a fine, to do community service. They can decide to not<br>
   take you in. Because it's not even something big. It could have been fixed<br>
   with me paying or community service.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: So, I didn't get more mad, I realized there was a warrant, and then I<br>
   went off on him. He was going to take me, so I softened up, and I was like,<br>
   "You know what? I'm about to go to work, I'm the man of the house, my wife<br>
   doesn't work, I have to pay the bills. I got to go. Don't take me in. You<br>
   know I can fix that in court." "No, no, no. For being a loudmouth, I'm<br>
   going to take you in." And I'm like, "You know I've got an ICE hold because<br>
   it shows there. If you take me in for that, they're going to deport me."<br>
   And I was like, "Who's going to take care of my family?" He was like, "Well<br>
   you should have thought of that when you ran your mouth." And I was like,<br>
   "Well you have the decision of letting me go and I can fix this with a<br>
   payment or anything, but you're going to mess up my family. I'm going to<br>
   get deported."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And I told him, "Man, you're Mexican, you're Hispanic, you might be<br>
   the first, second, third, generation, but I bet your people before that<br>
   weren't. Think about that shit man." He still took me. I went in. And like<br>
   36 hours later, no 24, almost a day and a half, only the time that it takes<br>
   to process in and process out, that's how I paid my sentence. 15 days,<br>
   which is, you do 10% of 15 days, how much time is it? Nothing. In and out.<br>
   But on the way out, you're getting dressed and everything and ICE is<br>
   already there "You've been in jail a few times and you've never seen ICE?"<br>
   And I was like, "Well no."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, they're like, "Where were you born?" This and that. And that's<br>
   it, they took me. And that's where I went to the immigration library and I<br>
   started looking at the different things that you can apply for.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, for three months, you were there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Because I wanted to see how I can stay there. And it was in<br>
   Lancaster. Well at the end, I got the voluntary departure. And I was<br>
   supposed to get out of the country, in two years marry my ex, marry her in<br>
   Mexico, and with her ask for a pardon.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: She's a U.S. citizen. And her daddy used to tell me, "Just get<br>
   married already. She has papers." But I was like, "No. It's because I don't<br>
   just want to do it just for the papers, you know? I want to buy her a<br>
   little ring, do a little something.” But so, that's what happened, so then<br>
   that's how I got deported. It wasn't even like I did something major or<br>
   anything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Yeah, that's crazy.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: I mean I know when I was younger, I did receive stolen property, I<br>
   did make bad decisions, but that's all involved with drug abuse and use.<br>
   It's not like, I woke up and I said, “I'm going to go steal a car.” No, I<br>
   was making bad decisions, you know, dumb stuff. It's not like any other<br>
   Americans never did it. You know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Any Americans, regardless of their race, you know? And that's what<br>
   happened. So, I'm working for a juvenile record and marijuana ticket as an<br>
   adult.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And then how long where you in Mexico before you tried to go back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: About a year. 11 months, almost a year. And then my father was going<br>
   to help me, he was going to pay for the coyote—$4,000-$5,000. But it’s<br>
   okay, if you don't cross, you don't pay, so it's okay. They didn't spend<br>
   the money or anything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you got caught at the border?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, I got caught at the border. So, then they were going to send me<br>
   out back to TJ. Which I wanted; I would have just tried to cross.<br>
   Unfortunately, that's what I would have tried to do. Because my son was<br>
   over there. My girl lost her apartment, she had to sell our big California<br>
   king bed that we had—I'm not worried about the bed, I just thought it was<br>
   cool. But my baby—well not this baby, but my first born. She lost the<br>
   apartment, she started selling the furniture because she didn't have no<br>
   money, and she couldn't work, she had the baby. Things like that. So, my<br>
   dad my was like, "Okay come on." But yeah, that's what happened. 11 months,<br>
   almost a year, I tried to go back, went to county. Well they give you state<br>
   time, they give you state prison time, but since the prisons are packed,<br>
   you do it in county, which is a little bit worse.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Oh, it's worse?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Nobody wants to be in the county. Because you're sleeping next to a<br>
   guy that doesn't know how much time he's going to do. So, it's not like<br>
   you're scared, but there's kids that are crying because they are doing 2, 3<br>
   years when the guy above you is facing 80 years to life. You better shut<br>
   your mouth. You're going to get something.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And so, you were there for a year and then came back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: A year and then 3 months in a detention. Oh, the last time, yes. No,<br>
   the last time, I just got deported right after the... And that was it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And then you decided lets—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Well not that I decided, I wanted to go right back. But my father was<br>
   like... Because the first time I got deported, I stayed in Mexicali, so I<br>
   never met my grandparents, none of them, I didn't see any of my aunties,<br>
   uncles, or anything. So, my dad is like, "Well this time you should go meet<br>
   the family. You're going to be there three months.” But it's been six<br>
   years, you know? So, he's like, “Go meet the family,” this and that. And<br>
   so, I went to HIldago, that's where I met my grandpa. My grandfather, he's<br>
   the man. I told my father, if I would have stayed here with my grandparents<br>
   or my grandfather, I think I would have been way better off. I would have<br>
   had a business or something. My grandfather knows how to cook bread. He<br>
   knows how to construction. He's a mechanic and he's a farmer. So, I mean he<br>
   doesn't have land, like a lot of land, but he gave every single one of his<br>
   kid’s land, a little piece at least. You know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's great.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And he's the humblest person ever. I think I got some of his traits.<br>
   He's no bull, he's good. He's an awesome person and he's 89 right now.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Wow. Well you got his brains. So, what do you miss about the US?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: My family and the lifestyle. If I ever went back to the States, I<br>
   wouldn't want to go back to Los Angeles. I wouldn't want to go there<br>
   because of all the movement, people that I know. It's not like I'm going to<br>
   go and make bad decisions. But, it's too hard. I want to be somewhere<br>
   where's there not a lot of people. Maybe out of the city, you know? I<br>
   wouldn't mind country living or anything like that because it's peaceful.<br>
   Like when I go to visit my grandparents, it's a small town, you can take a<br>
   deep breath of fresh air. Not like here. When we go over there to visit or<br>
   like I took my baby, so she could meet her grandad and all the aunties and<br>
   everything, and me and my girl didn't want to come back. We were just like,<br>
   you know…But we have to come back and work. And over there, there's no call<br>
   centers or anything like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: What were your dreams when you were in the US? And what are your<br>
   dreams now? Have they changed?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: I wanted to be an architect and help my mom and my dad. Because my<br>
   dad works a lot. And he's always up to something. But, bad decisions, you<br>
   know? Like it feels good when you send them money from here, like from here<br>
   we send them money. Other people they would say all your kids, your family,<br>
   is the one that hits you hardest sometimes. My uncles and aunties they had<br>
   their kids doing good and everything, "Oh look at your kids, they're pieces<br>
   of shit. They go to jail and they smoke, and this and that." And now that<br>
   we're helping them out from here, it's like, nobody says nothing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: One of my uncles, he's really really... I don't like him because he<br>
   thinks he's the best and this and that. And one day I got home from work<br>
   from the butchery or whatever, tired and I wanted to drink a beer. So, I<br>
   put some music low and I was drinking a beer. And he had a whole case of<br>
   beer upstairs himself. And, "Why you drinking beer? You can't be<br>
   disrespecting the house." I was like, "Look Uncle, I'm not a kid. And you<br>
   can't tell me anything. I just got here from work, I'm drinking a beer, and<br>
   I have my music low. Don't get me fucked up, Uncle." I'm sorry for the bad<br>
   words. "I'm not a kid and you're not nobody to tell me anything. Who am I<br>
   disrespecting?"<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And ever since that day, I was like, “Don't get it twisted Uncle.”<br>
   You know? And I was like, "You have your beer, what's the difference?" And<br>
   after that…I think it's because they had the picture of us all twisted, you<br>
   know? We've made bad decisions, but we ain't bad people. We're not trash.<br>
   We're nothing like that. I have values. I know how it is to live. I know<br>
   what's the right way. How you are supposed to do it. And family is the main<br>
   thing. At least to me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And that's your dream?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes. I still think of all that. I mean, right now, my parents<br>
   probably be helped out with... My little brother's growing up, but we can<br>
   help out too. Because my dad, he has diabetes. My mom does too. And my<br>
   mom's one of them holy ladies that, “Jesus Christ, I have nothing, Jesus<br>
   Christ will heal me.” I'm like, "Yes, Jesus Christ will heal you, but take<br>
   your medicine, take care of yourself." She was just in the hospital a month<br>
   ago, in and out, and I kept telling her, "Man, I believe your religion,<br>
   Mother, pray to your Jesus, but take care of yourself too."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: You're a good son.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And she would always tell us that she was good, but she didn't tell<br>
   us that... She would just tell us that she was good. But now I tell her,<br>
   "How good are you?" Because my dad tells us, "When she tells you she's<br>
   good, she's not really good." And now she laughs, she's like, "Okay, I feel<br>
   this or that." And she's more honest with us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: So, you said you had some ideas about programs to help returning<br>
   migrants either to adjust here or to get back to the States. What were your<br>
   ideas?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Well I don't know. Like at work sometimes, they apply for visas and<br>
   stuff like that, but I don't know if its related to any programs of trying<br>
   to go back or anything. But regardless of that, all I know if there was<br>
   something like that, you would have to show that you've been doing<br>
   something good for a while.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And that's what you're doing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yes. I'm taking care of mine. I'm doing what I'm supposed to.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Has life been okay in Mexico in the last six months?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Yeah, I mean it's okay, it's just you struggle way more. They don't<br>
   take care of anything here, like government wise. I don't want my baby to<br>
   be in a school. When we had Ilene over here, my stepdaughter, which is my<br>
   daughter to the fullest—I don't even call her my stepdaughter. First, she<br>
   didn't like me because my fiancé right now, her previous relationship was<br>
   bad. The guy used to beat her up. And I might be a tough guy, but you don't<br>
   touch a woman. And my dad made that clear to us. He said, "The day you guys<br>
   lift a finger to your mom, you're going to know who I am." Never<br>
   disrespected my mom. And nobody either around the neighborhood, because<br>
   they seen three big guys, "Oh that's your sons? Those are your kids?"<br>
   "Yeah, yeah, that's my mom right there." And it's different out here, but<br>
   it's a little bit harder.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: So, she had her previous relationship and Ilene, she was born over<br>
   there, but this girl came to follow this dumb ass that used to beat her up,<br>
   that abandoned them when she was born. You know? But that's how we met, so,<br>
   things happen. God works in mysterious ways, they say around there, you<br>
   know? But he used to beat her up and he used to treat her bad and<br>
   disrespected her and Ilene had that idea in her head.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: You know when she moved in with me, I never hit her, I never talked<br>
   to her bad, but I would explain the things to her. I would grab her when<br>
   she would be telling her mom that she was fat or ugly or things like that.<br>
   And I'd be like, "Ilene, come here please. I'm not your father miha. But<br>
   I'm going to let you know what's right and wrong. And I don't care if you<br>
   get mad or you cry, but you're going to listen to me. What does your mother<br>
   do every day? Go to work. And why do you think she goes to work?” “To feed<br>
   me.” “Why else? Do you need anything when you ask us for something, do we<br>
   not provide it if its needed?” I will teach her with, prove her with<br>
   things. I'd be like, “You can't talk to your mom like that. Your mom loves<br>
   you.” I'm like, “When does your mom tell you that you're ugly or when does<br>
   she make you feel bad?” I'm like, “How do you think she feels when you tell<br>
   her that?” I'm like, “No, no, no.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And the first times, she would just stay quiet. And then sometimes,<br>
   she would get really angry and she would hit me with that, "You're not my<br>
   dad." It's nothing, I know it's normal. And then after months, “Oh he's<br>
   mine,” that I was all hers and then she told me if she could call me papi,<br>
   if she can call me her dad. You can call me whatever you want miha. But the<br>
   way she addresses her mom? Completely different.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: That's tough.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: I educated her on why she shouldn't treat her mom a certain way, what<br>
   her mother does for her.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Do you think living in the US made you a different person than you<br>
   would've been if you stayed here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Not really a different person. Just noticed different types of<br>
   lifestyles and pretty much it. How people are because you can be here the<br>
   same as you are anywhere. I think if I was placed in any place, even in<br>
   Mars, I would still be the same person. You know? I just went through<br>
   certain decisions that obviously gets you consequences. But the States is<br>
   just more comfortable.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: We've been thinking about Canada too. Different things because right<br>
   here to live in the States, you either have to be a political asshole, I'm<br>
   sorry, or somebody that does things that they're not supposed to do.<br>
   There's a saying here that says, he who doesn't swindle or do something<br>
   doesn't advance. And if you're not the nephew or niece of a fucking<br>
   political mother fucker position, you can't get it. I mean if you study<br>
   hard and you do your thing, you can get to certain places. Or if you really<br>
   work hard, you'll live better. But you really have to work for it. It's not<br>
   as simple as in the States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: And like all the government stuff over here, in the city it's a<br>
   little bit better, but like over there in the hills, like I was saying<br>
   about Ilene. One time we took her to school, and we used to pay 150 pesos<br>
   for them to pick her up. But she's born in the States and she doesn't have<br>
   a CURP (Mexican ID), and they would always bother her that she needed to<br>
   bring those papers. And that's why we were going to the school, because<br>
   they're not supposed to bother her. They can't deny her education. And I<br>
   know that, I'm not dumb. So, we went over there, and it happened to be the<br>
   same day the teacher missed, so the teacher missed and they're like, "All<br>
   you kids go home." And I'm like—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Where's the substitute?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: I'm like, "I'm sorry, what do you mean go home? Didn't they just get<br>
   brought here on the transportation? How do you know they're going to get<br>
   home safe? So, if wouldn't have brought my daughter right now, your ass<br>
   would have sent her home alone, when she's nine years old, how do you<br>
   guarantee she was going to get to the house safe?" And I got mad. "Oh, it's<br>
   because we don't have a substitute." So then why don't you guys split the<br>
   class, and nobody goes home? How are you going to send everybody home?” I<br>
   mean they didn't listen to me. And I was like, “No man, I don't like this,<br>
   they don't have libraries with good... “People still make it, but they<br>
   really really have to want to do it and really have to push for it.<br>
   Especially in the hills. Where we live, it's kind of ugly. But that's where<br>
   we are for now. But we'll see what we can do, my baby? Get you out of them<br>
   hills.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Well it seems like you're doing a great job of it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: We're trying at least, you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: And working hard and hopefully there'll be a time you can go back and<br>
   see the rest of your family.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Hugo: Hopefully.<br>
