So tell us</br>   about, originally going to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S</span> with your parents, the circumstances</br>   behind it, that sort of thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Okay. Well, initially my grandfather was working on the fields</br>   somewhere in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. I don't remember exactly where. And we were living in</br>   a really poor neighborhood in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the State of Mexico</span>, which is</br>   outside of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>. And we weren't doing so good. So I think it was</br>   when the amnesty of ‘85 came in—something like that—my grandfather was</br>   actually able to get papers to become a citizen. And he invited us to go</br>   there and live with him. So my parents took on the offer, but we didn't</br>   have money, or whatever to do it in a formal way. So we had to cross.</br>   I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span>, or maybe even less when I crossed. And yeah, that's how I got</br>   into the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time. I was living in ____ at that moment.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you said you went with a woman who had papers for you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah, we didn't even know that lady. My parents were like, can</br>   you please cross my baby boy, we're going to cross over here. You could do</br>   it legally and it's going to be easier. And yeah, it was actually easier</br>   and I was lucky then, because I was given back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: And yeah, that's how we got there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you had siblings with you too?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yes, I had a little brother. So I was definitely <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span>, because my</br>   little brother is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span> younger than me. So yeah, I was with my big brother</br>   who's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four years</span> older and my little brother who's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span> younger than me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: [Affirmative noise]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So yeah, everybody crossed. Yeah, so she crossed me and my little</br>   brother who were actually given to this lady. And we got there, my uncle</br>   was already there, and we got into an apartment and we were living with</br>   them in ____ for my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> years. Should I continue, or what else? Like</br>   the whole story just kind of?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You just continue on.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Super long.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Well, just talk about how you learned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: —integrated to the community that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time and then why you went</br>   back up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Okay. Well so, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time, when I was a kid and I didn't even</br>   know that I wasn't really <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. So, I just grew up normally. My uncle's</br>   partner at the moment was really nice—she was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>—and she was an</br>   incredible person. She was really caring. So, she would take care of us and</br>   we would just watch TV, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Power Rangers</span>. And to</br>   me language was just whatever. So we just learned naturally <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. I just thought it was the same language, because we were speaking </br>   both back and forth at my house. So yeah, it wasn't hard at all. That's how I</br>   learned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. And in terms of like really fitting in, I was so little</br>   that I don't really remember exactly. But I mean they were good</br>   times. I didn't work, I didn't go to school, I was just watching</br>   TV.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were your parents working?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yes. They were working there. Yeah. My dad was working in a pizzeria,</br>   and my mom was a waiter. My big brother was going to school at that moment,</br>   so it was just me and my little brother and my aunt in the apartment. Mom</br>   would take care of us too. What else? Well, a funny thing is that I never spoke</br>   until I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six</span>, so they thought I was autistic or something. I never ever</br>   spoke. I would just watch TV. I mean, I would understand everything, but I</br>   didn't speak at all. So I don't know if it's like a repercussion of the</br>   whole experience, but I mean that's interesting I guess.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Very interesting.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. I would just watch TV and play piano because they had a little</br>   piano in the house.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Read musical?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: A little bit, I don't know, we just sit there and just play away.</br>   Yeah. And then we came back when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eight</span> or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So they never brought you to school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Even though you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven</span>, it might have.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. I never went to school because they were like deciding should</br>   we enroll them, should we not? Should we go back? Because the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time we</br>   left the States, it was because there was a lot of gangs as well [Chuckle],</br>   so it was like running away from violence, which is ironic because the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time I went back is because we were running away from violence,</br>   again. It seems that violence follows us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So were they worried about—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: They worried about my big brother going—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your big brother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: —going into like a gang or something like that. Because you know how</br>   the media kind of tells you what you're supposed to be over there—you're</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, so you're supposed to be like a Cholo, or something like that. So</br>   yeah, that kind of mentality wasn't really down with my parents. So they</br>   were like, you might as well leave. </br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you get back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and suddenly you had to?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Go to school and readapt and—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Then you had to speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> all the time. Was that hard?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: That wasn't hard actually. Because I always saw <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span></br>   as one language. But for my big brother that was really difficult for</br>   him cause he couldn't even write <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. It was just really easy to adapt</br>   for me and my little brother, because we never went to school. We just had</br>   to skip <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a couple of years</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I don't know how my parents did it,</br>   but we did it, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Now you were back in your original village? Your hometown?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. It was still kind of dangerous, but it wasn't as bad as before.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: I currently live there. I don't like it, but I currently live over</br>   there. What else? Yeah, so I was there and then it got a little bit rougher</br>   as time passed. And violence was… just a poor quality of life overall.</br>   Violence, poor services. Because since it's outside of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span> in</br>   another state—it's close but it's still another state. It's called an</br>   unprivileged neighborhood or something like that—they have a formal name</br>   for it. So, we were living over there and the conditions were really</br>   poorish. There was some kind of domestic violence ingoing on with my parents. </br>   They were having a lot of issues. So, one of my uncles invited us… “You can </br>   always come and live with me.” And my mom just got fed up of this whole situation</br>   with my dad and so just one night took us all and [Snaps finger] we</br>   disappeared.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Without your dad?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. It was interesting. We went to Tijuana, we stayed with some</br>   dude, I'm guessing he was a coyote or something like that. And then, he</br>   gave us like the shittiest IDs to cross and we did. My mom was super</br>   nervous at the time, but since I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span>, I don't remember. I didn't</br>   know the scope of the seriousness of what we were doing. So, me and my</br>   little brother, we were like, “Ah, it's like whatever.” So yeah, I think</br>   that sold it pretty well to the guy that was checking the IDs. So yeah, we</br>   crossed. And the funny thing is that we were on a shuttle to ____,</br>   that's the name of the town. And we were driving in this freeway and</br>   everybody’s just sitting there really serious, really quiet. And then we</br>   passed a couple immigration officers, and they actually stopped another</br>   shuttle. So, we passed them by, and I could just hear like [Sigh of relief]</br>   and everybody was cheering and stuff and like “Wow.” So it was a funny</br>   moment. It was surreal, like “What is going on?”, “Is everybody</br>   an inmigrant like me?” It was crazy [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's crazy, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So yeah, when we got off the shuttle my uncle's already waiting</br>   for us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And did you go to a different town this time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yes, we went to ____, really close to ____. So that's</br>   where we used to live. It was an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">eight hour</span> drive, so it was horrible. And</br>   I remember we stopped—my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> experience on the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time—was me</br>   stopping at the gas station and getting down and some dude randomly asking me</br>   if I was in a gang. That was my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> experience. And I should've known, I</br>   should’ve known this is not going to go well. Okay. So he just asked me</br>   because I was wearing a red shirt, but I like red, you know, just the</br>   color. So he asked me, “Norteño or something like that?” And I was</br>   like “No, I think I'm from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">South</span>.” And he gets all pissed off and</br>   everything and I don't know what the hell is going on. Then luckily he</br>   realizes it. I had literally no clue of what the hell he was saying.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So yeah, he left us alone. But yeah, it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It's crazy. You're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12 years old</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: And I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span> but I'm a pretty big dude.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah. Probably looked older.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. So people were always thinking I was older. That's how I was</br>   able to work, since I was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">13</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative noise]. So yeah, well we go back to the house. I know</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, but I don't really speak it that well. I understand everything</br>   though. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Well you never spoke till you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative sound]. Exactly. It was good at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, but then once you</br>   go to school and you talk to other kids, you start to realize that your</br>   life is not the same. That you cannot really relate to some of your peers.</br>   And you cannot do certain things. I didn't realize that I was going back</br>   into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> as an illegal immigrant until I was actually a</br>   junior in high school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you said you started high school when you went to the U.S.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And so <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> went by, you're going to school—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. And I was super open about my story. I was like, yeah, we just</br>   crossed. I come from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, but I wasn't really aware of the fact that I was</br>   &quot;illegal&quot;. This is just how it happened.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So how did it dawn on you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: When I asked if I could be part of a scholarship program</br>   or something like that, I don't remember exactly what it was. It was</br>   something about art because I was—and I'm still—really into art. But I</br>   asked and I remember that some of the requirements were, I don't know. Also</br>   when I was working, because they asked me for a social security number and</br>   stuff like that and I didn't had any or any official IDs. We went to some</br>   dude to take a picture of me and make me an ID. But at the moment I was</br>   oblivious of the fact that it was an illegal ID, it was a fake ID. But then</br>   like after that moment when I wanted to apply to this specific scholarship,</br>   I was like wait <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a minute</span>. I'm illegal in this country, I cannot apply to</br>   this thing! And yeah, from that point on it was like, I need to be careful,</br>   I don't want to get deported. But actually, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span> is like a really, or</br>   at least where I was, is like a really chill state. Not in terms of like</br>   people treating you well, but they don't ask. So I mean that's good enough</br>   I guess.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, is school really different when you came to the States versus</br>   when you were in school in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: When we got here it was like on summer vacation I think—well between</br>   school years.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So, it was perfect for us to just enroll for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the next year</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So, we got here and my uncle took us to this high school, that was</br>   called ____. That wasn't the nearest high school to our</br>   house. But this high school had specific programs tailored to immigrants.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So we took a test, an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> proficiency test. And it was my</br>   brother, me and my uncle, because my uncle is my age. And so he's like a</br>   brother. So we took the exam and it was, a number out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>. Right? So my</br>   uncle gets <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>, my brother gets <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span> and I get <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span></br>   out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>. So I mean, I guess I did good or like they congratulated me,</br>   but afterwards I realized that I should have done worse, but anyway.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And do it again.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: I would have gotten-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: More help.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Exactly. So yeah, they tell me that, my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> is proficient enough</br>   to go to regular school, but my brother and my uncle needs to go to that</br>   specific high school because they have classes for, they have ESL.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: ESL?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative noise]. They went to that school and I will go to this</br>   other high school called ____, but a bus would take them to</br>   ____, in another district. And I wish I would've known that</br>   it was easier over there because the immigrant community is bigger, right?</br>   So you have more people to relate to because the one I was going to, no one</br>   spoke <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and the people that knew how to speak Spanish did not want to</br>   speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. It was like a process of I'm not going to let them know that</br>   I know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. I'm not actually <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. And that was very few. I mean</br>   people were very nice. I'm not going to deny that, but at the same time I</br>   couldn't relate to anybody. I became a loner of some sort and I was just</br>   like isolated. Because I was at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, since I didn't talk, I was really</br>   introverted, but then like I blossomed. When I was in middle school and I</br>   was like really extroverted. But then with this change I became introverted</br>   again. So I would just mind my own business and I liked to play basketball a</br>   lot. So I will play basketball. I will do handstands. I liked to be very</br>   physical at the moment. So I would just train you know? It was funny</br>   because for some reason people thought that I was really mysterious like, “That</br>   dude must be a Ninja or something. He's really mysterious. He's just like</br>   doing flips and stuff.” I was really athletic at that moment. Not anymore.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I'm sure you're still athletic, you just have to practice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. So it was, that was that it was really tough. I didn't have any</br>   friends. I had one friend, but I think he was only my friend because he</br>   didn't have friends—so, it was like a pity case. Also, one of the things</br>   that I remember strongly about high school—my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> experience in high</br>   school—is that in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, usually rules are kind of rigid in the sense that</br>   if you're late, you need to knock on the door and ask for permission to</br>   enter the room. So, I did exactly that when I was over there in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">my first day</span> of high school. I</br>   wasn't confident in my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> so it was like really difficult for me and I</br>   did it. And everybody's like, what the hell is this guy doing? I was like,</br>   sorry for being, courteous, I was just trying to not be a douche. Okay. But</br>   then I understood that and then rallies, rallies were like really</br>   interesting because it's like what are we doing in the gym, school spirit</br>   or what do you mean? It was really weird and kids were, kids are bullies.</br>   Most of them even if they're bullied, they want to bully somebody else for</br>   some reason.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do they bully you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: No, well sometimes but not really because I was big, I remember that on my</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> rally I was just sitting on top of the bleachers and this small kid just</br>   started grabbing my thigh, right? Doing weird stuff to it. And I told him,</br>   &quot;You need to stop please. You need to stop.” He wouldn't stop. So I just</br>   hit him like this [makes a gesture with his arms] and with the elbow and I just ran away to the bathroom</br>   because I thought I was going to get expelled. So that was, that was</br>   interesting I guess. And yeah, so it was really tough. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">The first year</span> on</br>   that high school and I was living with like ten other people on that house.</br>   That was my uncle's house. That was before the real estate bubble in ‘08.</br>   So my uncle was doing pretty good. He was on, on real estate, doing real</br>   estate.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So he was doing pretty well. Pretty good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: And he had that house, he had his house and he had another house, but</br>   he lost everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you start getting interested in art in high school, or before?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Way before, since the beginning of my life, I was really artistic. So</br>   since the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time I was here I will play piano and then I will try to</br>   draw like comic books and stuff like that as well. I was always really</br>   proficient because I always practice it. Yeah. Man, what else?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And in high school you had the opportunity at least for a while to do</br>   art and then the scholarship.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Actually, in high school I stopped.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, you did?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: I kind of stopped.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Because of the scholarship?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. It was kind of like a heart-breaking moment for me. Because my</br>   arts teacher had asked, “Do you do envision yourself going to an art school</br>   program or something?” And I was like, “You know what, I never thought of</br>   that and do I have what it takes!” And, she was definitely pushing me</br>   towards that route. But she didn't know my exact situation and I never told</br>   her because I don't know, I just don't like people pitying me, you know? So</br>   yeah, I kind of stopped and I started dancing after that—just as a</br>   hobby, nothing serious yet. And then we moved from that house because it</br>   was a lot of people, a lot of problems. We're actually living in a garage.</br>   Me, my mom, my uncle and other <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> people in our garage.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your brother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: My big brother actually moved with my grandfather. So it was just my</br>   mom, my little brother and me and my uncle on that small garage. With other</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> people. And it was freezing cold and then super hot. It was really</br>   extreme. Anyway, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">those first years</span> were really tough because I couldn't</br>   really talk to people. I didn't have friends at school. The high school that I went to, is supposed to be the closest</br>   to my house, but it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">forty minutes</span> away walking. And yeah, I don't</br>   really have a choice. So I had to walk. So yeah, sometimes it would rain</br>   and I had to cross a field of strawberries to get into the high school. I</br>   mean, it was good when there were strawberries.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, I was just going to say.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah, exactly. I needed to wash them though. But yeah, it was</br>   kind of tough. And also, the whole culture kids are not used to, or maybe</br>   just humans, they're not used to like alien things. Because I remember I</br>   didn't know to say “salad.” And when I was at lunch, I will always try to</br>   eat a salad, try to be healthy, but I didn't know it was called a salad.</br>   So, I will just call it green thingy—I think it was my go-to word for</br>   whatever I didn't know. I will just tell them, &quot;Okay, can I have that green</br>   thingy?” And they will give it to me but they would look at me strange. And then one kid got really offended for some</br>   reason, like &quot;It's called a salad dude do you even speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?” And that</br>   was it, then I got really offended as well. And I was like well, &quot;Of course</br>   not. If I would, I would call it a salad.” It was dumb. But anyway, so</br>   yeah, that was strange. Also like the promiscuity of kids in that high</br>   school was really amusing to me. It's like holy cow, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">twelve, thirteen year   </span>olds already doing those things?! because my family's like really, is</br>   liberal in the sense that everything's okay, but at the same time they</br>   don't talk about it. So I mean, for me it was like a real shock. And</br>   also malls—malls were super scary. My <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time going into a mall was when</br>   I came back. When I was in high school. They're like these massive</br>   buildings and a lot of people there just buying stuff and the flashing colors, it was</br>   crazy. Anyway, it was an experience. And then we moved to an apartment.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Same high school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: No, the other one, the ____, the one that had a</br>   bigger immigrant community.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So then you transferred?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative noise] I transferred to that one. At first my mom was</br>   really against it because supposedly this one was better.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: But it was just misconceptions. This high school is better because it</br>   doesn't have a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>… just unfunded things. So yeah, I then</br>   transferred to the other one. And the ironic thing, at least for my mom, is</br>   that I didn't really have any close <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> friends. They were immigrants,</br>   but they were not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. And it's not because I didn't wanted to. It's</br>   because, I didn't feel that I fit in with that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> culture. I still</br>   don't feel like I fit in with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> values and culture, or with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span></br>   beliefs. I don't really like either. So, I ended up being really good</br>   friends with a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Asian</span> people actually. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Korean</span> people have really</br>   similar experiences—Korean people, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Vietnamese</span> people, Filipinos- with</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. So it was like really interesting to know all of that people.</br>   It's actually beautiful, like a beautiful cultural exchange. I think you</br>   grow as a person. And I also had like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> friends. Like one of my best</br>   friends is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. So, anyway, so we were over there, and we're</br>   supposed to be living in really shitty apartments. So, I was expecting like</br>   really horrible walls and rats everywhere and cockroaches— they told me</br>   that it was supposed to be like a bad neighborhood. But it was actually</br>   pretty good. I thought I was rich. So, we were</br>   living over there and I spent <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">my senior year</span> in that place. So luckily, my</br>   school social life improved slightly.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: And the only thing that I don't like is that just because I was</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, they assume a lot of things. Like the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> day I got into that</br>   high school, I was called to the principal's office and he asked me, &quot;Are</br>   you in a gang? Why are you wearing those colors?&quot; The same thing! &quot;What</br>   colors? What do you mean?&quot; I was wearing blue this time and then I kind of</br>   got the gist of it, right? So I told him, &quot;Is it because of the blue?</br>   Because this is not my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time, that people are asking me these dumb</br>   questions&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: And since that day they thought I was a smart ass, or something</br>   like that. Because I was like…I don't know how to call it, but it was dumb.</br>   A lot of the things, a lot of the attitudes that they had towards almost</br>   everything, was really stupid to me. Like for example, why are you assuming</br>   these things, just because of my shirt? And yeah, that was one thing. And</br>   since I used to draw a lot, I also like street art, graffiti and stuff like</br>   that. And my backpack was actually covered with my own artwork. So they</br>   thought I was the one doing...on that neighborhood.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: The graffiti?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative noise]. They thought I was the one doing graffiti. So,</br>   they just warned me not to do it and not to write any offensive things on</br>   my backpack.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, it's interesting, you're talking about this because we do talk to</br>   a lot of men, who go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, when they might be six or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven</span>,</br>   and then they grow up and they do join gangs. I mean a lot of them do join</br>   gangs and do bad stuff, criminal behavior. But you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: No, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I didn't ever thought you would. But what do you think drives</br>   those other kids to it and why not you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: I think that it was just a matter that my parents are really ignorant</br>   in terms of education—they didn't even finish elementary school—but the one</br>   thing that they did do well, is surround me and my siblings with books. I</br>   think that's like a great thing that they did. Because sometimes I was just</br>   bored of TV. And I will just go to the library—well our own personal</br>   library—and I would just grab a book. We had a bunch of good books…about</br>   sci-fi. I remember <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">The Time Machine</span> by <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Wells</span>. What other good books? We</br>   have a lot of books, fantasy books, we had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">The Lord of the Rings</span>. And I</br>   would just grab the thing. And we had a lot of math books. For some reason.</br>   I couldn't understand anything, but it was just fun looking at the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Comic books?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: —a lot of comic books as well. I'm a huge comic book nerd, so</br>   yeah. We had a lot of those, and I would just, surround myself in knowledge and art and whatever. I do think that expands your knowledge or</br>   like at least it gives you some sort of point of view, to realize that you</br>   don't have to necessarily comply to whatever standard society is telling you. So, I</br>   guess, at least for me, that was the difference with the people that</br>   actually join gangs. Because I think that the people that join gangs,</br>   that's a part of the environment—not solely faulty on them, but on society,</br>   because society is fostering those environments. So just, they want to feel</br>   accepted, they want to feel like they have a family in my opinion. So yeah,</br>   I think that was like the only difference. The only real difference.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's interesting. So you graduated from high school, you started a</br>   community college nearby, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And then you left?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Talk about the decision.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Well, while I was in high school, the overall feeling that I got from</br>   my counselor was that “He's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> and he's lucky if he graduates.” Right?</br>   So I didn't even know what an SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] was. And then</br>   I did the research myself and I realized that I wasn't going to be able to</br>   apply to a real, a four-year college or something like that. And</br>   thankfully I met a guy from, a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Puerto Rican</span> guy, from this community</br>   college and he told me, &quot;You know what, you can do your general ed and then</br>   you can decide on studying something.” He just approached me, and he was really</br>   nice. So I went to the community college with hopes of doing general ed and</br>   some art classes and maybe find a way to transfer to CalArts [California</br>   Institute of the Arts] and try to study animation or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: And I did that. And the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> obstacle was that since I wasn't really</br>   a resident, or even a citizen or whatever, the fee, the tuition for, per</br>   credit was triple. So it was, I had to work a lot just to pay for mediocre</br>   education.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: They've changed that now, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: They have, that's what I heard. I was like, [annoyed sound]. It's</br>   okay though. I mean, because my little brother actually graduated and he's</br>   like a mechanic or something. And he has DACA [Deferred Action for</br>   Childhood Arrivals], so.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: But the funny thing is that with all of those things, his life hasn't</br>   really improved that much. I was still going to school, paying triple, it’s</br>   okay, I don't mind—well I do mind, but I have no choice. So yeah, I'm doing</br>   that and I'm working a lot. And then after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> I realized that, what am</br>   I supposed to do? Am I really going to get into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">CalArts</span>? I don't have a</br>   social, I don't have an ID, I don't even have a bank account. I don't have</br>   nothing. What am I supposed to do? And it was kind of hard because I had to</br>   give that dream away.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You lost hope?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah, a little bit. But I mean that was really—fuck, this is the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time happening [Clearly emotional].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Anyway.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So I always like to dance. Right? So I thought, okay, maybe if a</br>   formal education is not from me, I can do something more attainable, that</br>   requires no money and I can still be somebody. So, I decided to start</br>   breakdancing a lot [Choking up]. A lot of hip-hop dancing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: And a lot of breakdancing. I will focus on breakdancing because I saw</br>   these incredible athletes on TV. And I was like, “Oh, this is what I do for</br>   fun. I can really focus on that thing and maybe become a pro. Maybe even</br>   get papers.” But it didn't work out, because competitions were all over the</br>   country and I couldn't move.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You couldn't get on a plane, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. So I was really disappointed. I just told my parents, &quot;You know</br>   I'm out. This country doesn't want us here and my dreams keep getting</br>   obstacles and obstacles, I just can't.” They didn't want me to and for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two   years</span> they were like really against it. But I mean at the end of the day I</br>   was almost over eighteen, so what could they do, right? So, I came back</br>   with the hopes of going to school, be better. I'm actually the only one in</br>   my family that has a bachelor's. [Emotional] So anyway, I come back because</br>   I want to keep studying and I want to stop that cycle of not being free to do what I</br>   want to do. Because after break dance I was like, what if I become a</br>   firefighter? Never mind, I can't do that. So yeah. And so I came back and I</br>   thought, “Okay, this is going to be…this is going to be kind of difficult.</br>   But I mean I already been here. Right? I already been here and—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What did you, do for you? Move in with your grandparents?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: No. We had a house, we had the same house that I left too, so.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And with your dad still here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: No my dad actually, cleared things up with my mom and like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three   years later</span>, caught up with us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. That's like an important thing that I didn't mention. Yeah. So,</br>   I mean luckily things are well my family now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: But I came back and I’m in at a big old house, that was it because</br>   it’s old.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So I'm there and a lot of people that keep telling me, “You better be</br>   careful you're going to get kidnapped.” They just keep scaring me to the</br>   point that I like set up a decoy on my actual bed and sleep in the closet.</br>   And that is ridiculous, because nothing happened. And it was always here.</br>   And I started going to universities. I had a cousin, so he was like, “Yeah</br>   I'll drive you, or we'll go together, or whatever.” And it was really scary</br>   because like traffic here is nuts. It's like I thought I was going to have</br>   a heart attack every single time I would get on a bus or something, but I</br>   had no option. So anyway, I started going into universities and trying to</br>   apply to private universities because I wasn't even sure if I was going to</br>   be eligible to going to a public university. So they keep telling me that</br>   yeah, definitely if I have the money, but that also I need to formalize my</br>   education by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> law, or something like that. And I didn't know</br>   anything about that. So, I had to call my big brother to go to my high</br>   school and ask for a—not my diploma, because I had it—but a transcript. And</br>   go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Department of State</span> and ask for an apostille thing. And he did,</br>   it took him <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like two years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Like he did it at the end. And yeah, I was able to get it. And then</br>   here I went to the offices, they have a high school division that takes</br>   care of that. So I went there, and I give them all of my papers and stuff.</br>   I had to translate everything and just pay some dude, some lawyer, to call</br>   me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">every hour</span> because he didn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. So, I basically paid him, I</br>   did his job and his assignment, and I had to pay him. Anyway, so, yeah,</br>   that happened. And after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> of struggling with that, I was able to</br>   finally have my high school accredited under <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> law. So finally with</br>   that I get into a private university, a cheap one because I have no real</br>   income.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: I mean I work at a call center, but you cannot really work and study</br>   at the same time in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Because here the idea of a part time job is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">six   to eight hours</span>. So that's a part time job, anyway. And the regular job is</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">like ten hours</span>. It's crazy. Anyway, so, I talked to my parents and they're</br>   like, “You know what, we are going to support you, while you do your</br>   university.” And at this time, I also meet a girl, she becomes my partner.</br>   She's still my partner right now. And she just encourages me to apply to a</br>   public school and we applied together and we ended up going to this</br>   university together. And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five years later</span>, we finish top of the class and</br>   yeah, it was great. There the sad part is that, the actual degree, I</br>   don't have it because they're giving me some bureaucratic problems because</br>   of my high school. So yeah, this is a ridiculous—one thing after another!</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What did you study?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Economics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh? I'm an economics professor.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yes! [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span> laughs]. I really like economics. Like everything in life</br>   is economics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah and my girlfriend studied the same. And she has the same problem</br>   actually, but not because she is an immigrant, just because she did</br>   homeschool.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative noise]. And they don't want to validate her studies,</br>   even though it's already been validated.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Because you graduated from college.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah, exactly! Anyway, so we were struggling with that right now. But</br>   I got really excited, I thought I was going to make it after college, but</br>   just the market in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, the labor market, there's so much. There's a lot</br>   of supply, cheap labor.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: People need jobs.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: [Affirmative noise]. That allows companies to pretty much set up the</br>   rules—“We're going to pay you low wages and if you want it, good, if you</br>   dont, there's a lot of people waiting, so...[Goodbye gesture]”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's rough.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. So, I noticed that you cannot really be, an economist,</br>   unless you know the right people—unless you can hook up with somebody in</br>   the government. So yeah, I was doing like really menial, administrative</br>   work and I was really depressed because so much effort and coming back and</br>   just feeling stuck, just like in the U.S. That's when I web searched, how to</br>   improve my life and I found ____. I actually found ____ that way</br>   and I applied <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the same day</span>. The next week I quit my job and I just started</br>   studying programming and now yeah, here I am.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you like it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: I love it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah, I do love it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And right now you're graduating. Do you have a job waiting once—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: I do have a couple of interviews scheduled, because I think that my</br>   specific background helps a lot, since I have knowledge in design and I have really strong</br>   math abilities—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Economics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah. It correlates very well with the requirements for a computer</br>   science student or something like that. So just the whole programming thing</br>   is really easy to me, to understand.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So, I advance really fast. So I do have very good job offers.</br>   Actually it's great because my salary can improve <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> times as much as</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So I mean I'm loving it right now. I'm really grateful with all the</br>   code. And finally with people that are actually trying to do something with</br>   immigrants. Because when I was here, literally none, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">zero</span> programs geared</br>   towards returnees, or the deported people, or whatever. The only thing that</br>   will help you is call centers and it's not really help. They just want to</br>   exploit you. So, yeah, I'm really glad that stuff like this is happening.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's wonderful.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, when do you think you'll start work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Most likely <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this month</span>. Because I already had got an offer, but I was</br>   advised not to take that offer because they were underpaying me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: So I didn't take that offer.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you're still—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: I'm still looking for a better option.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. Is your partner also, did she do ____ too, or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: No, she's working right now. She has a job, but it's still hard</br>   because her family suffers a lot from violence from their own family</br>   members. So, they're kind of dealing with a lot of legal issues. So yeah.</br>   Basically, I want to work hard and support them. Because I mean, it costs</br>   money to maintain such ordeals. But yeah, that's basically my story, I</br>   guess.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So what are your dreams now? I mean you talked a bit about your</br>   dreams in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S</span> how they kept getting sort of barriers and you'd have to</br>   cut back, what about now on your dreams?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Oh, right now I'm really ambitious. I noticed that nothing's going to</br>   be given to me and I need to take what I want. So right now, I just want to</br>   be the best programmer in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>. And I think I can achieve it. And</br>   even, I don't know, move somewhere else… somewhere where my values, because</br>   I have really different values from like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people, I'm really</br>   disciplined, I'm really honest. I'm extremely... I don't know how to say</br>   it. I'm really different, I guess. Even when people throw cigarettes on the</br>   floor it really bothers me. So, yeah, move somewhere like, I don't know,</br>   Singapore or something, where they're really strict because that's how I</br>   am. My dream is just to maybe move with her and her family—so they can</br>   avoid so much violence as well—to somewhere else. Maybe even <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span></br>   sounds good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Where did you get those values? Was it the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>? Was it family? Was</br>   it your meeting? Where do you think you got those values?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Honestly, I do think it was reading. I do think it was all the books</br>   because unlike me, my family is really different. We don't listen</br>   to the same music. I'm the only one who's artistically inclined. I just</br>   think that the key to a better society is definitely education. Definitely.</br>   Because it changes lives.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think being in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> made you different than you</br>   would have been if you'd stayed in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Definitely. It was really bad most of the time. But those experiences</br>   made me the person that I am right now. So, I wouldn't change it. And I do</br>   think that it played a big role in building my character and my personality</br>   and in-depth values that I have.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government? What do you think they can do?</br>   What should they be doing to help returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Well, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> of all, just create something like ESL [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> as a</br>   Second Language], like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> as a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> language. I was lucky, but a lot</br>   of my peers, they can barely speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and they're</br>   supposed to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. And everything is in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> here—nothing is in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. At least in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> a lot of documents are in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> or even</br>   other languages. But in here, that's really hard. So, I would really</br>   encourage the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government to create some sort of program that</br>   teaches deportees and immigrants <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> as a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> language. What else?</br>   Some sort of way to speedy up bureaucratic processes to get your birth</br>   certificate, IDs, and even bank accounts. ____ actually helps us out</br>   getting bank accounts, so that's really great. I think they could do that.</br>   What else they could do? Just exploit the skills that these people</br>   have—they speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and they speak it incredibly well. That's just a</br>   waste of talent right there, you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Of course.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: And yeah, I think those are like—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Okay, well we're pretty much done. But is there</br>   anything that you'd like to share at the end, that you haven't said yet?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Luis</span>: Well I don't know. I just think that the U.S.— they don't say it and</br>   it’s never going to be said—but immigration, illegal immigration in the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span> is a business. They require that cheap labor. And right now</br>   the only thing that they are trying to do is just to balance things out the</br>   way they want it. Because illegal immigration is still going to be a thing, I</br>   think, forever because they need people to exploit. Because at the end</br>   of the day, we live in a capitalist society. And I understand that for me</br>   to have these <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Calvin Klein</span> shoes that I bought at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Payless</span>, somebody</br>   else had suffer. For me to have a good life, somebody else needs to have a</br>   bad life and that's just how the world works. But I think that just</br>   understanding that fact and understanding that immigrant people in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S</span></br>   are more than just assets. They are people, they have dreams. They could be</br>   like a positive force for the communities. And just, I don't know. It's</br>   just as difficult, because money rules the world I guess. And at the end of</br>   the day, a lot of companies just don't care and they want cheap labor. And</br>   a lot of people just want to pay less. Just understanding that things are</br>   this way, that your wonderful life is wonderful because other people</br>   suffer. I think that's just a huge, big step towards a better, more equal</br>   society. Yeah, that's pretty much it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Family reunification, Economic, Opportunity">Luis: Okay. Well, initially my grandfather was working on the fields   somewhere in California. I don't remember exactly where. And we were living in   a really poor neighborhood in Mexico, in the State of Mexico, which is   outside of Mexico City. And we weren't doing so good. So I think it was   when the amnesty of ‘85 came in—something like that—my grandfather was   actually able to get papers to become a citizen. And he invited us to go   there and live with him. So my parents took on the offer, but we didn't   have money, or whatever to do it in a formal way. So we had to cross.   I was one, or maybe even less when I crossed. And yeah, that's how I got   into the first time. I was living in ____ at that moment.    </span> Anne: And you said you went with a woman who had papers for you.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, we didn't even know that lady. My parents were like, can</br>   you please cross my baby boy, we're going to cross over here. You could do</br>   it legally and it's going to be easier. And yeah, it was actually easier</br>   and I was lucky then, because I was given back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And yeah, that's how we got there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had siblings with you too?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes, I had a little brother. So I was definitely one, because my</br>   little brother is one year younger than me. So yeah, I was with my big brother</br>   who's four years older and my little brother who's one year younger than me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Affirmative noise]</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So yeah, everybody crossed. Yeah, so she crossed me and my little</br>   brother who were actually given to this lady. And we got there, my uncle</br>   was already there, and we got into an apartment and we were living with</br>   them in ____ for my first years. Should I continue, or what else? Like</br>   the whole story just kind of?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You just continue on.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Super long.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well, just talk about how you learned English and—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: —integrated to the community that first time and then why you went</br>   back up.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Okay. Well so, the first time, when I was a kid and I didn't even</br>   know that I wasn't really American. So, I just grew up normally. My uncle's</br>   partner at the moment was really nice—she was American—and she was an</br>   incredible person. She was really caring. So, she would take care of us and</br>   we would just watch TV, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers. And to</br>   me language was just whatever. So we just learned naturally English and</br>   Spanish. I just thought it was the same language, because we were speaking </br>   both back and forth at my house. So yeah, it wasn't hard at all. That's how I</br>   learned English. And in terms of like really fitting in, I was so little</br>   that I don't really remember exactly. But I mean they were good</br>   times. I didn't work, I didn't go to school, I was just watching</br>   TV.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were your parents working?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes. They were working there. Yeah. My dad was working in a pizzeria,</br>   and my mom was a waiter. My big brother was going to school at that moment,</br>   so it was just me and my little brother and my aunt in the apartment. Mom</br>   would take care of us too. What else? Well, a funny thing is that I never spoke</br>   until I was six, so they thought I was autistic or something. I never ever</br>   spoke. I would just watch TV. I mean, I would understand everything, but I</br>   didn't speak at all. So I don't know if it's like a repercussion of the</br>   whole experience, but I mean that's interesting I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Very interesting.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. I would just watch TV and play piano because they had a little</br>   piano in the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Read musical?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: A little bit, I don't know, we just sit there and just play away.</br>   Yeah. And then we came back when I was seven, eight or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So they never brought you to school?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Even though you were six or seven, it might have.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. I never went to school because they were like deciding should</br>   we enroll them, should we not? Should we go back? Because the first time we</br>   left the States, it was because there was a lot of gangs as well [Chuckle],</br>   so it was like running away from violence, which is ironic because the</br>   second time I went back is because we were running away from violence,</br>   again. It seems that violence follows us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So were they worried about—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: They worried about my big brother going—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your big brother?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: —going into like a gang or something like that. Because you know how</br>   the media kind of tells you what you're supposed to be over there—you're</br>   Mexican, so you're supposed to be like a Cholo, or something like that. So</br>   yeah, that kind of mentality wasn't really down with my parents. So they</br>   were like, you might as well leave. </br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you get back to Mexico and suddenly you had to?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Go to school and readapt and—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Then you had to speak Spanish all the time. Was that hard?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: That wasn't hard actually. Because I always saw English and Spanish</br>   as one language. But for my big brother that was really difficult for</br>   him cause he couldn't even write Spanish. It was just really easy to adapt</br>   for me and my little brother, because we never went to school. We just had</br>   to skip a couple of years in Mexico. I don't know how my parents did it,</br>   but we did it, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Now you were back in your original village? Your hometown?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It was still kind of dangerous, but it wasn't as bad as before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I currently live there. I don't like it, but I currently live over</br>   there. What else? Yeah, so I was there and then it got a little bit rougher</br>   as time passed. And violence was… just a poor quality of life overall.</br>   Violence, poor services. Because since it's outside of Mexico City in</br>   another state—it's close but it's still another state. It's called an</br>   unprivileged neighborhood or something like that—they have a formal name</br>   for it. So, we were living over there and the conditions were really</br>   poorish. There was some kind of domestic violence ingoing on with my parents. </br>   They were having a lot of issues. So, one of my uncles invited us… “You can </br>   always come and live with me.” And my mom just got fed up of this whole situation</br>   with my dad and so just one night took us all and [Snaps finger] we</br>   disappeared.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Without your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It was interesting. We went to Tijuana, we stayed with some</br>   dude, I'm guessing he was a coyote or something like that. And then, he</br>   gave us like the shittiest IDs to cross and we did. My mom was super</br>   nervous at the time, but since I was 12, 13, I don't remember. I didn't</br>   know the scope of the seriousness of what we were doing. So, me and my</br>   little brother, we were like, “Ah, it's like whatever.” So yeah, I think</br>   that sold it pretty well to the guy that was checking the IDs. So yeah, we</br>   crossed. And the funny thing is that we were on a shuttle to ____,</br>   that's the name of the town. And we were driving in this freeway and</br>   everybody’s just sitting there really serious, really quiet. And then we</br>   passed a couple immigration officers, and they actually stopped another</br>   shuttle. So, we passed them by, and I could just hear like [Sigh of relief]</br>   and everybody was cheering and stuff and like “Wow.” So it was a funny</br>   moment. It was surreal, like “What is going on?”, “Is everybody</br>   an inmigrant like me?” It was crazy [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's crazy, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So yeah, when we got off the shuttle my uncle's already waiting</br>   for us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you go to a different town this time?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes, we went to ____, really close to ____. So that's</br>   where we used to live. It was an eight hour drive, so it was horrible. And</br>   I remember we stopped—my first experience on the second time—was me</br>   stopping at the gas station and getting down and some dude randomly asking me</br>   if I was in a gang. That was my first experience. And I should've known, I</br>   should’ve known this is not going to go well. Okay. So he just asked me</br>   because I was wearing a red shirt, but I like red, you know, just the</br>   color. So he asked me, “Norteño or something like that?” And I was</br>   like “No, I think I'm from the South.” And he gets all pissed off and</br>   everything and I don't know what the hell is going on. Then luckily he</br>   realizes it. I had literally no clue of what the hell he was saying.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So yeah, he left us alone. But yeah, it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's crazy. You're 12 years old.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And I was 12 but I'm a pretty big dude.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Probably looked older.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So people were always thinking I was older. That's how I was</br>   able to work, since I was like 13.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. So yeah, well we go back to the house. I know</br>   English, but I don't really speak it that well. I understand everything</br>   though. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well you never spoke till you're six.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative sound]. Exactly. It was good at first, but then once you</br>   go to school and you talk to other kids, you start to realize that your</br>   life is not the same. That you cannot really relate to some of your peers.</br>   And you cannot do certain things. I didn't realize that I was going back</br>   into the United States as an illegal immigrant until I was actually a</br>   junior in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said you started high school when you went to the U.S.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so two years went by, you're going to school—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. And I was super open about my story. I was like, yeah, we just</br>   crossed. I come from Mexico, but I wasn't really aware of the fact that I was</br>   &quot;illegal&quot;. This is just how it happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did it dawn on you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: When I asked if I could be part of a scholarship program</br>   or something like that, I don't remember exactly what it was. It was</br>   something about art because I was—and I'm still—really into art. But I</br>   asked and I remember that some of the requirements were, I don't know. Also</br>   when I was working, because they asked me for a social security number and</br>   stuff like that and I didn't had any or any official IDs. We went to some</br>   dude to take a picture of me and make me an ID. But at the moment I was</br>   oblivious of the fact that it was an illegal ID, it was a fake ID. But then</br>   like after that moment when I wanted to apply to this specific scholarship,</br>   I was like wait a minute. I'm illegal in this country, I cannot apply to</br>   this thing! And yeah, from that point on it was like, I need to be careful,</br>   I don't want to get deported. But actually, California is like a really, or</br>   at least where I was, is like a really chill state. Not in terms of like</br>   people treating you well, but they don't ask. So I mean that's good enough</br>   I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, is school really different when you came to the States versus</br>   when you were in school in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: When we got here it was like on summer vacation I think—well between</br>   school years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So, it was perfect for us to just enroll for the next year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So, we got here and my uncle took us to this high school, that was</br>   called ____. That wasn't the nearest high school to our</br>   house. But this high school had specific programs tailored to immigrants.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So we took a test, an English proficiency test. And it was my</br>   brother, me and my uncle, because my uncle is my age. And so he's like a</br>   brother. So we took the exam and it was, a number out of five. Right? So my</br>   uncle gets one out of five, my brother gets two out of five and I get four</br>   out of five. So I mean, I guess I did good or like they congratulated me,</br>   but afterwards I realized that I should have done worse, but anyway.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And do it again.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I would have gotten-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: More help.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Exactly. So yeah, they tell me that, my English is proficient enough</br>   to go to regular school, but my brother and my uncle needs to go to that</br>   specific high school because they have classes for, they have ESL.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: ESL?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They went to that school and I will go to this</br>   other high school called ____, but a bus would take them to</br>   ____, in another district. And I wish I would've known that</br>   it was easier over there because the immigrant community is bigger, right?</br>   So you have more people to relate to because the one I was going to, no one</br>   spoke Spanish and the people that knew how to speak Spanish did not want to</br>   speak Spanish. It was like a process of I'm not going to let them know that</br>   I know Spanish. I'm not actually American. And that was very few. I mean</br>   people were very nice. I'm not going to deny that, but at the same time I</br>   couldn't relate to anybody. I became a loner of some sort and I was just</br>   like isolated. Because I was at first, since I didn't talk, I was really</br>   introverted, but then like I blossomed. When I was in middle school and I</br>   was like really extroverted. But then with this change I became introverted</br>   again. So I would just mind my own business and I liked to play basketball a</br>   lot. So I will play basketball. I will do handstands. I liked to be very</br>   physical at the moment. So I would just train you know? It was funny</br>   because for some reason people thought that I was really mysterious like, “That</br>   dude must be a Ninja or something. He's really mysterious. He's just like</br>   doing flips and stuff.” I was really athletic at that moment. Not anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I'm sure you're still athletic, you just have to practice.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So it was, that was that it was really tough. I didn't have any</br>   friends. I had one friend, but I think he was only my friend because he</br>   didn't have friends—so, it was like a pity case. Also, one of the things</br>   that I remember strongly about high school—my first experience in high</br>   school—is that in Mexico, usually rules are kind of rigid in the sense that</br>   if you're late, you need to knock on the door and ask for permission to</br>   enter the room. So, I did exactly that when I was over there in my first day of high school. I</br>   wasn't confident in my English so it was like really difficult for me and I</br>   did it. And everybody's like, what the hell is this guy doing? I was like,</br>   sorry for being, courteous, I was just trying to not be a douche. Okay. But</br>   then I understood that and then rallies, rallies were like really</br>   interesting because it's like what are we doing in the gym, school spirit</br>   or what do you mean? It was really weird and kids were, kids are bullies.</br>   Most of them even if they're bullied, they want to bully somebody else for</br>   some reason.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do they bully you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, well sometimes but not really because I was big, I remember that on my</br>   first rally I was just sitting on top of the bleachers and this small kid just</br>   started grabbing my thigh, right? Doing weird stuff to it. And I told him,</br>   &quot;You need to stop please. You need to stop.” He wouldn't stop. So I just</br>   hit him like this [makes a gesture with his arms] and with the elbow and I just ran away to the bathroom</br>   because I thought I was going to get expelled. So that was, that was</br>   interesting I guess. And yeah, so it was really tough. The first year on</br>   that high school and I was living with like ten other people on that house.</br>   That was my uncle's house. That was before the real estate bubble in ‘08.</br>   So my uncle was doing pretty good. He was on, on real estate, doing real</br>   estate.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So he was doing pretty well. Pretty good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And he had that house, he had his house and he had another house, but</br>   he lost everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you start getting interested in art in high school, or before?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Way before, since the beginning of my life, I was really artistic. So</br>   since the first time I was here I will play piano and then I will try to</br>   draw like comic books and stuff like that as well. I was always really</br>   proficient because I always practice it. Yeah. Man, what else?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And in high school you had the opportunity at least for a while to do</br>   art and then the scholarship.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Actually, in high school I stopped.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, you did?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I kind of stopped.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because of the scholarship?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It was kind of like a heart-breaking moment for me. Because my</br>   arts teacher had asked, “Do you do envision yourself going to an art school</br>   program or something?” And I was like, “You know what, I never thought of</br>   that and do I have what it takes!” And, she was definitely pushing me</br>   towards that route. But she didn't know my exact situation and I never told</br>   her because I don't know, I just don't like people pitying me, you know? So</br>   yeah, I kind of stopped and I started dancing after that—just as a</br>   hobby, nothing serious yet. And then we moved from that house because it</br>   was a lot of people, a lot of problems. We're actually living in a garage.</br>   Me, my mom, my uncle and other four people in our garage.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: My big brother actually moved with my grandfather. So it was just my</br>   mom, my little brother and me and my uncle on that small garage. With other</br>   four people. And it was freezing cold and then super hot. It was really</br>   extreme. Anyway, those first years were really tough because I couldn't</br>   really talk to people. I didn't have friends at school. The high school that I went to, is supposed to be the closest</br>   to my house, but it was forty minutes away walking. And yeah, I don't</br>   really have a choice. So I had to walk. So yeah, sometimes it would rain</br>   and I had to cross a field of strawberries to get into the high school. I</br>   mean, it was good when there were strawberries.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, I was just going to say.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, exactly. I needed to wash them though. But yeah, it was</br>   kind of tough. And also, the whole culture kids are not used to, or maybe</br>   just humans, they're not used to like alien things. Because I remember I</br>   didn't know to say “salad.” And when I was at lunch, I will always try to</br>   eat a salad, try to be healthy, but I didn't know it was called a salad.</br>   So, I will just call it green thingy—I think it was my go-to word for</br>   whatever I didn't know. I will just tell them, &quot;Okay, can I have that green</br>   thingy?” And they will give it to me but they would look at me strange. And then one kid got really offended for some</br>   reason, like &quot;It's called a salad dude do you even speak English?” And that</br>   was it, then I got really offended as well. And I was like well, &quot;Of course</br>   not. If I would, I would call it a salad.” It was dumb. But anyway, so</br>   yeah, that was strange. Also like the promiscuity of kids in that high</br>   school was really amusing to me. It's like holy cow, twelve, thirteen year</br>   olds already doing those things?! because my family's like really, is</br>   liberal in the sense that everything's okay, but at the same time they</br>   don't talk about it. So I mean, for me it was like a real shock. And</br>   also malls—malls were super scary. My first time going into a mall was when</br>   I came back. When I was in high school. They're like these massive</br>   buildings and a lot of people there just buying stuff and the flashing colors, it was</br>   crazy. Anyway, it was an experience. And then we moved to an apartment.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Same high school?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, the other one, the ____, the one that had a</br>   bigger immigrant community.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So then you transferred?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise] I transferred to that one. At first my mom was</br>   really against it because supposedly this one was better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But it was just misconceptions. This high school is better because it</br>   doesn't have a lot of Mexicans… just unfunded things. So yeah, I then</br>   transferred to the other one. And the ironic thing, at least for my mom, is</br>   that I didn't really have any close Mexican friends. They were immigrants,</br>   but they were not Mexicans. And it's not because I didn't wanted to. It's</br>   because, I didn't feel that I fit in with that Mexican culture. I still</br>   don't feel like I fit in with Mexican values and culture, or with American</br>   beliefs. I don't really like either. So, I ended up being really good</br>   friends with a lot of Asian people actually. Korean people have really</br>   similar experiences—Korean people, Vietnamese people, Filipinos- with</br>   Mexicans. So it was like really interesting to know all of that people.</br>   It's actually beautiful, like a beautiful cultural exchange. I think you</br>   grow as a person. And I also had like American friends. Like one of my best</br>   friends is American. So, anyway, so we were over there, and we're</br>   supposed to be living in really shitty apartments. So, I was expecting like</br>   really horrible walls and rats everywhere and cockroaches— they told me</br>   that it was supposed to be like a bad neighborhood. But it was actually</br>   pretty good. I thought I was rich. So, we were</br>   living over there and I spent my senior year in that place. So luckily, my</br>   school social life improved slightly.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And the only thing that I don't like is that just because I was</br>   Mexican, they assume a lot of things. Like the first day I got into that</br>   high school, I was called to the principal's office and he asked me, &quot;Are</br>   you in a gang? Why are you wearing those colors?&quot; The same thing! &quot;What</br>   colors? What do you mean?&quot; I was wearing blue this time and then I kind of</br>   got the gist of it, right? So I told him, &quot;Is it because of the blue?</br>   Because this is not my first time, that people are asking me these dumb</br>   questions&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And since that day they thought I was a smart ass, or something</br>   like that. Because I was like…I don't know how to call it, but it was dumb.</br>   A lot of the things, a lot of the attitudes that they had towards almost</br>   everything, was really stupid to me. Like for example, why are you assuming</br>   these things, just because of my shirt? And yeah, that was one thing. And</br>   since I used to draw a lot, I also like street art, graffiti and stuff like</br>   that. And my backpack was actually covered with my own artwork. So they</br>   thought I was the one doing...on that neighborhood.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The graffiti?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They thought I was the one doing graffiti. So,</br>   they just warned me not to do it and not to write any offensive things on</br>   my backpack.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it's interesting, you're talking about this because we do talk to</br>   a lot of men, who go to the United States, when they might be six or seven,</br>   and then they grow up and they do join gangs. I mean a lot of them do join</br>   gangs and do bad stuff, criminal behavior. But you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I didn't ever thought you would. But what do you think drives</br>   those other kids to it and why not you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I think that it was just a matter that my parents are really ignorant</br>   in terms of education—they didn't even finish elementary school—but the one</br>   thing that they did do well, is surround me and my siblings with books. I</br>   think that's like a great thing that they did. Because sometimes I was just</br>   bored of TV. And I will just go to the library—well our own personal</br>   library—and I would just grab a book. We had a bunch of good books…about</br>   sci-fi. I remember The Time Machine by Wells. What other good books? We</br>   have a lot of books, fantasy books, we had The Lord of the Rings. And I</br>   would just grab the thing. And we had a lot of math books. For some reason.</br>   I couldn't understand anything, but it was just fun looking at the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Comic books?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: —a lot of comic books as well. I'm a huge comic book nerd, so</br>   yeah. We had a lot of those, and I would just, surround myself in knowledge and art and whatever. I do think that expands your knowledge or</br>   like at least it gives you some sort of point of view, to realize that you</br>   don't have to necessarily comply to whatever standard society is telling you. So, I</br>   guess, at least for me, that was the difference with the people that</br>   actually join gangs. Because I think that the people that join gangs,</br>   that's a part of the environment—not solely faulty on them, but on society,</br>   because society is fostering those environments. So just, they want to feel</br>   accepted, they want to feel like they have a family in my opinion. So yeah,</br>   I think that was like the only difference. The only real difference.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's interesting. So you graduated from high school, you started a</br>   community college nearby, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then you left?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Talk about the decision.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Well, while I was in high school, the overall feeling that I got from</br>   my counselor was that “He's Mexican and he's lucky if he graduates.” Right?</br>   So I didn't even know what an SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] was. And then</br>   I did the research myself and I realized that I wasn't going to be able to</br>   apply to a real, a four-year college or something like that. And</br>   thankfully I met a guy from, a Puerto Rican guy, from this community</br>   college and he told me, &quot;You know what, you can do your general ed and then</br>   you can decide on studying something.” He just approached me, and he was really</br>   nice. So I went to the community college with hopes of doing general ed and</br>   some art classes and maybe find a way to transfer to CalArts [California</br>   Institute of the Arts] and try to study animation or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And I did that. And the first obstacle was that since I wasn't really</br>   a resident, or even a citizen or whatever, the fee, the tuition for, per</br>   credit was triple. So it was, I had to work a lot just to pay for mediocre</br>   education.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They've changed that now, in California.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: They have, that's what I heard. I was like, [annoyed sound]. It's</br>   okay though. I mean, because my little brother actually graduated and he's</br>   like a mechanic or something. And he has DACA [Deferred Action for</br>   Childhood Arrivals], so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But the funny thing is that with all of those things, his life hasn't</br>   really improved that much. I was still going to school, paying triple, it’s</br>   okay, I don't mind—well I do mind, but I have no choice. So yeah, I'm doing</br>   that and I'm working a lot. And then after a year I realized that, what am</br>   I supposed to do? Am I really going to get into CalArts? I don't have a</br>   social, I don't have an ID, I don't even have a bank account. I don't have</br>   nothing. What am I supposed to do? And it was kind of hard because I had to</br>   give that dream away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You lost hope?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, a little bit. But I mean that was really—fuck, this is the</br>   first time happening [Clearly emotional].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Anyway.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   L<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Pastimes,  dance,  breakdancing, Immigration status, Lost opportunities">uis: So I always like to dance. Right? So I thought, okay, maybe if a   formal education is not from me, I can do something more attainable, that   requires no money and I can still be somebody. So, I decided to start   breakdancing a lot [Choking up]. A lot of hip-hop dancing.     Anne: Oh, yeah.     Luis: And a lot of breakdancing. I will focus on breakdancing because I saw   these incredible athletes on TV. And I was like, “Oh, this is what I do for   fun. I can really focus on that thing and maybe become a pro. Maybe even   get papers.” But it didn't work out, because competitions were all over the   country and I couldn't move.     Anne: You couldn't get on a plane, right?     Luis: Yeah. So I was really disappointed. I just told my parents, &quot;You know   I'm out. This country doesn't want us here and my dreams keep getting   obstacles and obstacles, I just can't.” They didn't want me to and for two   years they were like really against it. But I mean at the end of the day I   was almost over eighteen, so what could they do, right? So, I came back   with the hopes of going to school, be better. I'm actually the only one in   my family that has a bachelor's. [Emotional] So anyway, I come back because   I want to keep studying and I want to stop that cycle of not being free to do what I   want to do. Because after break dance I was like, what if I become a   firefighter? Never mind, I can't do that. So yeah. And so I came back and I   thought, “Okay, this is going to be…this is going to be kind of difficult.   But I mean I already been here. Right? I already been here and—&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DACA, Eligibility, Siblings">Luis: And I did that. And the first obstacle was that since I wasn't really   a resident, or even a citizen or whatever, the fee, the tuition for, per   credit was triple. So it was, I had to work a lot just to pay for mediocre   education.     Anne: They've changed that now, in California.     Luis: They have, that's what I heard. I was like, [annoyed sound]. It's   okay though. I mean, because my little brother actually graduated and he's   like a mechanic or something. And he has DACA [Deferred Action for   Childhood Arrivals], so.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, High school, Challenges, Homelife">Anyway, those first years were really tough because I couldn't   really talk to people. I didn't have friends at school. The high school that I went to, is supposed to be the closest   to my house, but it was forty minutes away walking. And yeah, I don't   really have a choice. So I had to walk. So yeah, sometimes it would rain   and I had to cross a field of strawberries to get into the high school. I   mean, it was good when there were strawberries.     Anne: Yeah, I was just going to say.    </span> Luis: Yeah, exactly. I needed to wash them though. But yeah, it was</br>   kind of tough. And also, the whole culture kids are not used to, or maybe</br>   just humans, they're not used to like alien things. Because I remember I</br>   didn't know to say “salad.” And when I was at lunch, I will always try to</br>   eat a salad, try to be healthy, but I didn't know it was called a salad.</br>   So, I will just call it green thingy—I think it was my go-to word for</br>   whatever I didn't know. I will just tell them, &quot;Okay, can I have that green</br>   thingy?” And they will give it to me but they would look at me strange. And then one kid got really offended for some</br>   reason, like &quot;It's called a salad dude do you even speak English?” And that</br>   was it, then I got really offended as well. And I was like well, &quot;Of course</br>   not. If I would, I would call it a salad.” It was dumb. But anyway, so</br>   yeah, that was strange. Also like the promiscuity of kids in that high</br>   school was really amusing to me. It's like holy cow, twelve, thirteen year</br>   olds already doing those things?! because my family's like really, is</br>   liberal in the sense that everything's okay, but at the same time they</br>   don't talk about it. So I mean, for me it was like a real shock. And</br>   also malls—malls were super scary. My first time going into a mall was when</br>   I came back. When I was in high school. They're like these massive</br>   buildings and a lot of people there just buying stuff and the flashing colors, it was</br>   crazy. Anyway, it was an experience. And then we moved to an apartment.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Same high school?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, the other one, the ____, the one that had a</br>   bigger immigrant community.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So then you transferred?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise] I transferred to that one. At first my mom was</br>   really against it because supposedly this one was better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But it was just misconceptions. This high school is better because it</br>   doesn't have a lot of Mexicans… just unfunded things. So yeah, I then</br>   transferred to the other one. And the ironic thing, at least for my mom, is</br>   that I didn't really have any close Mexican friends. They were immigrants,</br>   but they were not Mexicans. And it's not because I didn't wanted to. It's</br>   because, I didn't feel that I fit in with that Mexican culture. I still</br>   don't feel like I fit in with Mexican values and culture, or with American</br>   beliefs. I don't really like either. So, I ended up being really good</br>   friends with a lot of Asian people actually. Korean people have really</br>   similar experiences—Korean people, Vietnamese people, Filipinos- with</br>   Mexicans. So it was like really interesting to know all of that people.</br>   It's actually beautiful, like a beautiful cultural exchange. I think you</br>   grow as a person. And I also had like American friends. Like one of my best</br>   friends is American. So, anyway, so we were over there, and we're</br>   supposed to be living in really shitty apartments. So, I was expecting like</br>   really horrible walls and rats everywhere and cockroaches— they told me</br>   that it was supposed to be like a bad neighborhood. But it was actually</br>   pretty good. I thought I was rich. So, we were</br>   living over there and I spent my senior year in that place. So luckily, my</br>   school social life improved slightly.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And the only thing that I don't like is that just because I was</br>   Mexican, they assume a lot of things. Like the first day I got into that</br>   high school, I was called to the principal's office and he asked me, &quot;Are</br>   you in a gang? Why are you wearing those colors?&quot; The same thing! &quot;What</br>   colors? What do you mean?&quot; I was wearing blue this time and then I kind of</br>   got the gist of it, right? So I told him, &quot;Is it because of the blue?</br>   Because this is not my first time, that people are asking me these dumb</br>   questions&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And since that day they thought I was a smart ass, or something</br>   like that. Because I was like…I don't know how to call it, but it was dumb.</br>   A lot of the things, a lot of the attitudes that they had towards almost</br>   everything, was really stupid to me. Like for example, why are you assuming</br>   these things, just because of my shirt? And yeah, that was one thing. And</br>   since I used to draw a lot, I also like street art, graffiti and stuff like</br>   that. And my backpack was actually covered with my own artwork. So they</br>   thought I was the one doing...on that neighborhood.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The graffiti?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They thought I was the one doing graffiti. So,</br>   they just warned me not to do it and not to write any offensive things on</br>   my backpack.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it's interesting, you're talking about this because we do talk to</br>   a lot of men, who go to the United States, when they might be six or seven,</br>   and then they grow up and they do join gangs. I mean a lot of them do join</br>   gangs and do bad stuff, criminal behavior. But you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I didn't ever thought you would. But what do you think drives</br>   those other kids to it and why not you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I think that it was just a matter that my parents are really ignorant</br>   in terms of education—they didn't even finish elementary school—but the one</br>   thing that they did do well, is surround me and my siblings with books. I</br>   think that's like a great thing that they did. Because sometimes I was just</br>   bored of TV. And I will just go to the library—well our own personal</br>   library—and I would just grab a book. We had a bunch of good books…about</br>   sci-fi. I remember The Time Machine by Wells. What other good books? We</br>   have a lot of books, fantasy books, we had The Lord of the Rings. And I</br>   would just grab the thing. And we had a lot of math books. For some reason.</br>   I couldn't understand anything, but it was just fun looking at the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Comic books?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: —a lot of comic books as well. I'm a huge comic book nerd, so</br>   yeah. We had a lot of those, and I would just, surround myself in knowledge and art and whatever. I do think that expands your knowledge or</br>   like at least it gives you some sort of point of view, to realize that you</br>   don't have to necessarily comply to whatever standard society is telling you. So, I</br>   guess, at least for me, that was the difference with the people that</br>   actually join gangs. Because I think that the people that join gangs,</br>   that's a part of the environment—not solely faulty on them, but on society,</br>   because society is fostering those environments. So just, they want to feel</br>   accepted, they want to feel like they have a family in my opinion. So yeah,</br>   I think that was like the only difference. The only real difference.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's interesting. So you graduated from high school, you started a</br>   community college nearby, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then you left?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Talk about the decision.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Well, while I was in high school, the overall feeling that I got from</br>   my counselor was that “He's Mexican and he's lucky if he graduates.” Right?</br>   So I didn't even know what an SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] was.

Because after break dance I was like, what if I become a</br>   firefighter? Never mind, I can't do that. So yeah. And so I came back and I</br>   thought, “Okay, this is going to be…this is going to be kind of difficult.</br>   But I mean I already been here. Right? I already been here and—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you, do for you? Move in with your grandparents?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No. We had a house, we had the same house that I left too, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And with your dad still here?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No my dad actually, cleared things up with my mom and like three</br>   years later, caught up with us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. That's like an important thing that I didn't mention. Yeah. So,</br>   I mean luckily things are well my family now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But I came back and I’m in at a big old house, that was it because</br>   it’s old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I'm there and a lot of people that keep telling me, “You better be</br>   careful you're going to get kidnapped.” They just keep scaring me to the</br>   point that I like set up a decoy on my actual bed and sleep in the closet.</br>   And that is ridiculous, because nothing happened. And it was always here.</br>   And I started going to universities. I had a cousin, so he was like, “Yeah</br>   I'll drive you, or we'll go together, or whatever.” And it was really scary</br>   because like traffic here is nuts. It's like I thought I was going to have</br>   a heart attack every single time I would get on a bus or something, but I</br>   had no option. So anyway, I started going into universities and trying to</br>   apply to private universities because I wasn't even sure if I was going to</br>   be eligible to going to a public university. So they keep telling me that</br>   yeah, definitely if I have the money, but that also I need to formalize my</br>   education by Mexican law, or something like that. And I didn't know</br>   anything about that. So, I had to call my big brother to go to my high</br>   school and ask for a—not my diploma, because I had it—but a transcript. And</br>   go to the Department of State and ask for an apostille thing. And he did,</br>   it took him like two years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Like he did it at the end. And yeah, I was able to get it. And then</br>   here I went to the offices, they have a high school division that takes</br>   care of that. So I went there, and I give them all of my papers and stuff.</br>   I had to translate everything and just pay some dude, some lawyer, to call</br>   me every hour because he didn't speak English. So, I basically paid him, I</br>   did his job and his assignment, and I had to pay him. Anyway, so, yeah,</br>   that happened. And after two years of struggling with that, I was able to</br>   finally have my high school accredited under Mexican law. So finally with</br>   that I get into a private university, a cheap one because I have no real</br>   income.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I mean I work at a call center, but you cannot really work and study</br>   at the same time in Mexico. Because here the idea of a part time job is six</br>   to eight hours. So that's a part time job, anyway. And the regular job is</br>   like ten hours. It's crazy. Anyway, so, I talked to my parents and they're</br>   like, “You know what, we are going to support you, while you do your</br>   university.” And at this time, I also meet a girl, she becomes my partner.</br>   She's still my partner right now. And she just encourages me to apply to a</br>   public school and we applied together and we ended up going to this</br>   university together. And five years later, we finish top of the class and</br>   yeah, it was great. There the sad part is that, the actual degree, I</br>   don't have it because they're giving me some bureaucratic problems because</br>   of my high school. So yeah, this is a ridiculous—one thing after another!</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you study?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh? I'm an economics professor.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes! [Anne laughs]. I really like economics. Like everything in life</br>   is economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah and my girlfriend studied the same. And she has the same problem</br>   actually, but not because she is an immigrant, just because she did</br>   homeschool.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. And they don't want to validate her studies,</br>   even though it's already been validated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you graduated from college.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, exactly! Anyway, so we were struggling with that right now. But</br>   I got really excited, I thought I was going to make it after college, but</br>   just the market in Mexico, the labor market, there's so much. There's a lot</br>   of supply, cheap labor.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: People need jobs.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. That allows companies to pretty much set up the</br>   rules—“We're going to pay you low wages and if you want it, good, if you</br>   dont, there's a lot of people waiting, so...[Goodbye gesture]”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's rough.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So, I noticed that you cannot really be, an economist,</br>   unless you know the right people—unless you can hook up with somebody in</br>   the government. So yeah, I was doing like really menial, administrative</br>   work and I was really depressed because so much effort and coming back and</br>   just feeling stuck, just like in the U.S. That's when I web searched, how to</br>   improve my life and I found ____. I actually found ____ that way</br>   and I applied the same day. The next week I quit my job and I just started</br>   studying programming and now yeah, here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you like it?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I love it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, I do love it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And right now you're graduating. Do you have a job waiting once—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I do have a couple of interviews scheduled, because I think that my</br>   specific background helps a lot, since I have knowledge in design and I have really strong</br>   math abilities—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Economics.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It correlates very well with the requirements for a computer</br>   science student or something like that. So just the whole programming thing</br>   is really easy to me, to understand.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So, I advance really fast. So I do have very good job offers.</br>   Actually it's great because my salary can improve three times as much as</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I mean I'm loving it right now. I'm really grateful with all the</br>   code. And finally with people that are actually trying to do something with</br>   immigrants. Because when I was here, literally none, zero programs geared</br>   towards returnees, or the deported people, or whatever. The only thing that</br>   will help you is call centers and it's not really help. They just want to</br>   exploit you. So, yeah, I'm really glad that stuff like this is happening.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's wonderful.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when do you think you'll start work?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Most likely this month. Because I already had got an offer, but I was</br>   advised not to take that offer because they were underpaying me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I didn't take that offer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you're still—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I'm still looking for a better option.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Is your partner also, did she do ____ too, or?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, she's working right now. She has a job, but it's still hard</br>   because her family suffers a lot from violence from their own family</br>   members. So, they're kind of dealing with a lot of legal issues. So yeah.</br>   Basically, I want to work hard and support them. Because I mean, it costs</br>   money to maintain such ordeals. But yeah, that's basically my story, I</br>   guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are your dreams now? I mean you talked a bit about your</br>   dreams in the U.S how they kept getting sort of barriers and you'd have to</br>   cut back, what about now on your dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Oh, right now I'm really ambitious. I noticed that nothing's going to</br>   be given to me and I need to take what I want. So right now, I just want to</br>   be the best programmer in Mexico City. And I think I can achieve it. And</br>   even, I don't know, move somewhere else… somewhere where my values, because</br>   I have really different values from like Mexican people, I'm really</br>   disciplined, I'm really honest. I'm extremely... I don't know how to say</br>   it. I'm really different, I guess. Even when people throw cigarettes on the</br>   floor it really bothers me. So, yeah, move somewhere like, I don't know,</br>   Singapore or something, where they're really strict because that's how I</br>   am. My dream is just to maybe move with her and her family—so they can</br>   avoid so much violence as well—to somewhere else. Maybe even Canada. Canada</br>   sounds good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where did you get those values? Was it the U.S.? Was it family? Was</br>   it your meeting? Where do you think you got those values?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Honestly, I do think it was reading. I do think it was all the books</br>   because unlike me, my family is really different. We don't listen</br>   to the same music. I'm the only one who's artistically inclined. I just</br>   think that the key to a better society is definitely education. Definitely.</br>   Because it changes lives.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the United States made you different than you</br>   would have been if you'd stayed in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Definitely. It was really bad most of the time. But those experiences</br>   made me the person that I am right now. So, I wouldn't change it. And I do</br>   think that it played a big role in building my character and my personality</br>   and in-depth values that I have.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about the Mexican government? What do you think they can do?</br>   What should they be doing to help returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Well, first of all, just create something like ESL [English as a</br>   Second Language], like Spanish as a second language. I was lucky, but a lot</br>   of my peers, they can barely speak Spanish and they're</br>   supposed to be Mexican. And everything is in Spanish here—nothing is in</br>   English. At least in the States a lot of documents are in Spanish or even</br>   other languages. But in here, that's really hard. So, I would really</br>   encourage the Mexican government to create some sort of program that</br>   teaches deportees and immigrants Spanish as a second language. What else?</br>   Some sort of way to speedy up bureaucratic processes to get your birth</br>   certificate, IDs, and even bank accounts. ____ actually helps us out</br>   getting bank accounts, so that's really great. I think they could do that.</br>   What else they could do? Just exploit the skills that these people</br>   have—they speak English and they speak it incredibly well. That's just a</br>   waste of talent right there, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Of course.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And yeah, I think those are like—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Okay, well we're pretty much done. But is there</br>   anything that you'd like to share at the end, that you haven't said yet?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, US government and immigration">Luis: Well I don't know. I just think that the U.S.— they don't say it and   it’s never going to be said—but immigration, illegal immigration in the   United States is a business. They require that cheap labor. And right now   the only thing that they are trying to do is just to balance things out the   way they want it. Because illegal immigration is still going to be a thing, I   think, forever because they need people to exploit. Because at the end   of the day, we live in a capitalist society. And I understand that for me   to have these Calvin Klein shoes that I bought at Payless, somebody   else had suffer. For me to have a good life, somebody else needs to have a   bad life and that's just how the world works. But I think that just   understanding that fact and understanding that immigrant people in the U.S   are more than just assets. They are people, they have dreams. They could be   like a positive force for the communities. And just, I don't know. It's   just as difficult, because money rules the world I guess. And at the end of   the day, a lot of companies just don't care and they want cheap labor. And   a lot of people just want to pay less. Just understanding that things are   this way, that your wonderful life is wonderful because other people   suffer. I think that's just a huge, big step towards a better, more equal   society. Yeah, that's pretty much it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, What Mexico has gained, Reflections, Mexico, Policy for reintegration, Language, Jobs">Anne: What about the Mexican government?

So, I noticed that you cannot really be, an economist,   unless you know the right people—unless you can hook up with somebody in   the government. So yeah, I was doing like really menial, administrative   work and I was really depressed because so much effort and coming back and   just feeling stuck, just like in the U.S. That's when I web searched, how to   improve my life and I found ____. I actually found ____ that way   and I applied the same day. The next week I quit my job and I just started   studying programming and now yeah, here I am.     Anne: Do you like it?     Luis: I love it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">____</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US">____</span> at that moment.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said you went with a woman who had papers for you.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, we didn't even know that lady. My parents were like, can</br>   you please cross my baby boy, we're going to cross over here. You could do</br>   it legally and it's going to be easier. And yeah, it was actually easier</br>   and I was lucky then, because I was given back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And yeah, that's how we got there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had siblings with you too?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes, I had a little brother. So I was definitely one, because my</br>   little brother is one year younger than me. So yeah, I was with my big brother</br>   who's four years older and my little brother who's one year younger than me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Affirmative noise]</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So yeah, everybody crossed. Yeah, so she crossed me and my little</br>   brother who were actually given to this lady. And we got there, my uncle</br>   was already there, and we got into an apartment and we were living with</br>   them in ____ for my first years. Should I continue, or what else? Like</br>   the whole story just kind of?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You just continue on.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Super long.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well, just talk about how you learned English and—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: —integrated to the community that first time and then why you went</br>   back up.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Okay. Well so, the first time, when I was a kid and I didn't even</br>   know that I wasn't really American. So, I just grew up normally. My uncle's</br>   partner at the moment was really nice—she was American—and she was an</br>   incredible person. She was really caring. So, she would take care of us and</br>   we would just watch TV, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers. And to</br>   me language was just whatever. So we just learned naturally English and</br>   Spanish. I just thought it was the same language, because we were speaking </br>   both back and forth at my house. So yeah, it wasn't hard at all. That's how I</br>   learned English. And in terms of like really fitting in, I was so little</br>   that I don't really remember exactly. But I mean they were good</br>   times. I didn't work, I didn't go to school, I was just watching</br>   TV.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were your parents working?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes. They were working there. Yeah. My dad was working in a pizzeria,</br>   and my mom was a waiter. My big brother was going to school at that moment,</br>   so it was just me and my little brother and my aunt in the apartment. Mom</br>   would take care of us too. What else? Well, a funny thing is that I never spoke</br>   until I was six, so they thought I was autistic or something. I never ever</br>   spoke. I would just watch TV. I mean, I would understand everything, but I</br>   didn't speak at all. So I don't know if it's like a repercussion of the</br>   whole experience, but I mean that's interesting I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Very interesting.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. I would just watch TV and play piano because they had a little</br>   piano in the house.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Read musical?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: A little bit, I don't know, we just sit there and just play away.</br>   Yeah. And then we came back when I was seven, eight or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So they never brought you to school?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Even though you were six or seven, it might have.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. I never went to school because they were like deciding should</br>   we enroll them, should we not? Should we go back? Because the first time we</br>   left the States, it was because there was a lot of gangs as well [Chuckle],</br>   so it was like running away from violence, which is ironic because the</br>   second time I went back is because we were running away from violence,</br>   again. It seems that violence follows us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So were they worried about—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: They worried about my big brother going—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your big brother?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: —going into like a gang or something like that. Because you know how</br>   the media kind of tells you what you're supposed to be over there—you're</br>   Mexican, so you're supposed to be like a Cholo, or something like that. So</br>   yeah, that kind of mentality wasn't really down with my parents. So they</br>   were like, you might as well leave. </br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you get back to Mexico and suddenly you had to?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Go to school and readapt and—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Then you had to speak Spanish all the time. Was that hard?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: That wasn't hard actually. Because I always saw English and Spanish</br>   as one language. But for my big brother that was really difficult for</br>   him cause he couldn't even write Spanish. It was just really easy to adapt</br>   for me and my little brother, because we never went to school. We just had</br>   to skip a couple of years in Mexico. I don't know how my parents did it,</br>   but we did it, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Now you were back in your original village? Your hometown?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It was still kind of dangerous, but it wasn't as bad as before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I currently live there. I don't like it, but I currently live over</br>   there. What else? Yeah, so I was there and then it got a little bit rougher</br>   as time passed. And violence was… just a poor quality of life overall.</br>   Violence, poor services. Because since it's outside of Mexico City in</br>   another state—it's close but it's still another state. It's called an</br>   unprivileged neighborhood or something like that—they have a formal name</br>   for it. So, we were living over there and the conditions were really</br>   poorish. There was some kind of domestic violence ingoing on with my parents. </br>   They were having a lot of issues. So, one of my uncles invited us… “You can </br>   always come and live with me.” And my mom just got fed up of this whole situation</br>   with my dad and so just one night took us all and [Snaps finger] we</br>   disappeared.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Without your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It was interesting. We went to Tijuana, we stayed with some</br>   dude, I'm guessing he was a coyote or something like that. And then, he</br>   gave us like the shittiest IDs to cross and we did. My mom was super</br>   nervous at the time, but since I was 12, 13, I don't remember. I didn't</br>   know the scope of the seriousness of what we were doing. So, me and my</br>   little brother, we were like, “Ah, it's like whatever.” So yeah, I think</br>   that sold it pretty well to the guy that was checking the IDs. So yeah, we</br>   crossed. And the funny thing is that we were on a shuttle to ____,</br>   that's the name of the town. And we were driving in this freeway and</br>   everybody’s just sitting there really serious, really quiet. And then we</br>   passed a couple immigration officers, and they actually stopped another</br>   shuttle. So, we passed them by, and I could just hear like [Sigh of relief]</br>   and everybody was cheering and stuff and like “Wow.” So it was a funny</br>   moment. It was surreal, like “What is going on?”, “Is everybody</br>   an inmigrant like me?” It was crazy [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's crazy, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So yeah, when we got off the shuttle my uncle's already waiting</br>   for us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you go to a different town this time?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes, we went to ____, really close to ____. So that's</br>   where we used to live. It was an eight hour drive, so it was horrible. And</br>   I remember we stopped—my first experience on the second time—was me</br>   stopping at the gas station and getting down and some dude randomly asking me</br>   if I was in a gang. That was my first experience. And I should've known, I</br>   should’ve known this is not going to go well. Okay. So he just asked me</br>   because I was wearing a red shirt, but I like red, you know, just the</br>   color. So he asked me, “Norteño or something like that?” And I was</br>   like “No, I think I'm from the South.” And he gets all pissed off and</br>   everything and I don't know what the hell is going on. Then luckily he</br>   realizes it. I had literally no clue of what the hell he was saying.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So yeah, he left us alone. But yeah, it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's crazy. You're 12 years old.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And I was 12 but I'm a pretty big dude.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Probably looked older.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So people were always thinking I was older. That's how I was</br>   able to work, since I was like 13.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. So yeah, well we go back to the house. I know</br>   English, but I don't really speak it that well. I understand everything</br>   though. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well you never spoke till you're six.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative sound]. Exactly. It was good at first, but then once you</br>   go to school and you talk to other kids, you start to realize that your</br>   life is not the same. That you cannot really relate to some of your peers.</br>   And you cannot do certain things. I didn't realize that I was going back</br>   into the United States as an illegal immigrant until I was actually a</br>   junior in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said you started high school when you went to the U.S.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so two years went by, you're going to school—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. And I was super open about my story. I was like, yeah, we just</br>   crossed. I come from Mexico, but I wasn't really aware of the fact that I was</br>   &quot;illegal&quot;. This is just how it happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did it dawn on you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: When I asked if I could be part of a scholarship program</br>   or something like that, I don't remember exactly what it was. It was</br>   something about art because I was—and I'm still—really into art. But I</br>   asked and I remember that some of the requirements were, I don't know. Also</br>   when I was working, because they asked me for a social security number and</br>   stuff like that and I didn't had any or any official IDs. We went to some</br>   dude to take a picture of me and make me an ID. But at the moment I was</br>   oblivious of the fact that it was an illegal ID, it was a fake ID. But then</br>   like after that moment when I wanted to apply to this specific scholarship,</br>   I was like wait a minute. I'm illegal in this country, I cannot apply to</br>   this thing! And yeah, from that point on it was like, I need to be careful,</br>   I don't want to get deported. But actually, California is like a really, or</br>   at least where I was, is like a really chill state. Not in terms of like</br>   people treating you well, but they don't ask. So I mean that's good enough</br>   I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, is school really different when you came to the States versus</br>   when you were in school in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: When we got here it was like on summer vacation I think—well between</br>   school years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So, it was perfect for us to just enroll for the next year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So, we got here and my uncle took us to this high school, that was</br>   called ____. That wasn't the nearest high school to our</br>   house. But this high school had specific programs tailored to immigrants.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So we took a test, an English proficiency test. And it was my</br>   brother, me and my uncle, because my uncle is my age. And so he's like a</br>   brother. So we took the exam and it was, a number out of five. Right? So my</br>   uncle gets one out of five, my brother gets two out of five and I get four</br>   out of five. So I mean, I guess I did good or like they congratulated me,</br>   but afterwards I realized that I should have done worse, but anyway.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And do it again.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I would have gotten-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: More help.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Exactly. So yeah, they tell me that, my English is proficient enough</br>   to go to regular school, but my brother and my uncle needs to go to that</br>   specific high school because they have classes for, they have ESL.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: ESL?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They went to that school and I will go to this</br>   other high school called ____, but a bus would take them to</br>   ____, in another district. And I wish I would've known that</br>   it was easier over there because the immigrant community is bigger, right?</br>   So you have more people to relate to because the one I was going to, no one</br>   spoke Spanish and the people that knew how to speak Spanish did not want to</br>   speak Spanish. It was like a process of I'm not going to let them know that</br>   I know Spanish. I'm not actually American. And that was very few. I mean</br>   people were very nice. I'm not going to deny that, but at the same time I</br>   couldn't relate to anybody. I became a loner of some sort and I was just</br>   like isolated. Because I was at first, since I didn't talk, I was really</br>   introverted, but then like I blossomed. When I was in middle school and I</br>   was like really extroverted. But then with this change I became introverted</br>   again. So I would just mind my own business and I liked to play basketball a</br>   lot. So I will play basketball. I will do handstands. I liked to be very</br>   physical at the moment. So I would just train you know? It was funny</br>   because for some reason people thought that I was really mysterious like, “That</br>   dude must be a Ninja or something. He's really mysterious. He's just like</br>   doing flips and stuff.” I was really athletic at that moment. Not anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I'm sure you're still athletic, you just have to practice.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So it was, that was that it was really tough. I didn't have any</br>   friends. I had one friend, but I think he was only my friend because he</br>   didn't have friends—so, it was like a pity case. Also, one of the things</br>   that I remember strongly about high school—my first experience in high</br>   school—is that in Mexico, usually rules are kind of rigid in the sense that</br>   if you're late, you need to knock on the door and ask for permission to</br>   enter the room. So, I did exactly that when I was over there in my first day of high school. I</br>   wasn't confident in my English so it was like really difficult for me and I</br>   did it. And everybody's like, what the hell is this guy doing? I was like,</br>   sorry for being, courteous, I was just trying to not be a douche. Okay. But</br>   then I understood that and then rallies, rallies were like really</br>   interesting because it's like what are we doing in the gym, school spirit</br>   or what do you mean? It was really weird and kids were, kids are bullies.</br>   Most of them even if they're bullied, they want to bully somebody else for</br>   some reason.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do they bully you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, well sometimes but not really because I was big, I remember that on my</br>   first rally I was just sitting on top of the bleachers and this small kid just</br>   started grabbing my thigh, right? Doing weird stuff to it. And I told him,</br>   &quot;You need to stop please. You need to stop.” He wouldn't stop. So I just</br>   hit him like this [makes a gesture with his arms] and with the elbow and I just ran away to the bathroom</br>   because I thought I was going to get expelled. So that was, that was</br>   interesting I guess. And yeah, so it was really tough. The first year on</br>   that high school and I was living with like ten other people on that house.</br>   That was my uncle's house. That was before the real estate bubble in ‘08.</br>   So my uncle was doing pretty good. He was on, on real estate, doing real</br>   estate.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So he was doing pretty well. Pretty good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And he had that house, he had his house and he had another house, but</br>   he lost everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you start getting interested in art in high school, or before?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Way before, since the beginning of my life, I was really artistic. So</br>   since the first time I was here I will play piano and then I will try to</br>   draw like comic books and stuff like that as well. I was always really</br>   proficient because I always practice it. Yeah. Man, what else?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And in high school you had the opportunity at least for a while to do</br>   art and then the scholarship.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Actually, in high school I stopped.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, you did?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I kind of stopped.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because of the scholarship?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It was kind of like a heart-breaking moment for me. Because my</br>   arts teacher had asked, “Do you do envision yourself going to an art school</br>   program or something?” And I was like, “You know what, I never thought of</br>   that and do I have what it takes!” And, she was definitely pushing me</br>   towards that route. But she didn't know my exact situation and I never told</br>   her because I don't know, I just don't like people pitying me, you know? So</br>   yeah, I kind of stopped and I started dancing after that—just as a</br>   hobby, nothing serious yet. And then we moved from that house because it</br>   was a lot of people, a lot of problems. We're actually living in a garage.</br>   Me, my mom, my uncle and other four people in our garage.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: My big brother actually moved with my grandfather. So it was just my</br>   mom, my little brother and me and my uncle on that small garage. With other</br>   four people. And it was freezing cold and then super hot. It was really</br>   extreme. Anyway, those first years were really tough because I couldn't</br>   really talk to people. I didn't have friends at school. The high school that I went to, is supposed to be the closest</br>   to my house, but it was forty minutes away walking. And yeah, I don't</br>   really have a choice. So I had to walk. So yeah, sometimes it would rain</br>   and I had to cross a field of strawberries to get into the high school. I</br>   mean, it was good when there were strawberries.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, I was just going to say.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, exactly. I needed to wash them though. But yeah, it was</br>   kind of tough. And also, the whole culture kids are not used to, or maybe</br>   just humans, they're not used to like alien things. Because I remember I</br>   didn't know to say “salad.” And when I was at lunch, I will always try to</br>   eat a salad, try to be healthy, but I didn't know it was called a salad.</br>   So, I will just call it green thingy—I think it was my go-to word for</br>   whatever I didn't know. I will just tell them, &quot;Okay, can I have that green</br>   thingy?” And they will give it to me but they would look at me strange. And then one kid got really offended for some</br>   reason, like &quot;It's called a salad dude do you even speak English?” And that</br>   was it, then I got really offended as well. And I was like well, &quot;Of course</br>   not. If I would, I would call it a salad.” It was dumb. But anyway, so</br>   yeah, that was strange. Also like the promiscuity of kids in that high</br>   school was really amusing to me. It's like holy cow, twelve, thirteen year</br>   olds already doing those things?! because my family's like really, is</br>   liberal in the sense that everything's okay, but at the same time they</br>   don't talk about it. So I mean, for me it was like a real shock. And</br>   also malls—malls were super scary. My first time going into a mall was when</br>   I came back. When I was in high school. They're like these massive</br>   buildings and a lot of people there just buying stuff and the flashing colors, it was</br>   crazy. Anyway, it was an experience. And then we moved to an apartment.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Same high school?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, the other one, the ____, the one that had a</br>   bigger immigrant community.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So then you transferred?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise] I transferred to that one. At first my mom was</br>   really against it because supposedly this one was better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But it was just misconceptions. This high school is better because it</br>   doesn't have a lot of Mexicans… just unfunded things. So yeah, I then</br>   transferred to the other one. And the ironic thing, at least for my mom, is</br>   that I didn't really have any close Mexican friends. They were immigrants,</br>   but they were not Mexicans. And it's not because I didn't wanted to. It's</br>   because, I didn't feel that I fit in with that Mexican culture. I still</br>   don't feel like I fit in with Mexican values and culture, or with American</br>   beliefs. I don't really like either. So, I ended up being really good</br>   friends with a lot of Asian people actually. Korean people have really</br>   similar experiences—Korean people, Vietnamese people, Filipinos- with</br>   Mexicans. So it was like really interesting to know all of that people.</br>   It's actually beautiful, like a beautiful cultural exchange. I think you</br>   grow as a person. And I also had like American friends. Like one of my best</br>   friends is American. So, anyway, so we were over there, and we're</br>   supposed to be living in really shitty apartments. So, I was expecting like</br>   really horrible walls and rats everywhere and cockroaches— they told me</br>   that it was supposed to be like a bad neighborhood. But it was actually</br>   pretty good. I thought I was rich. So, we were</br>   living over there and I spent my senior year in that place. So luckily, my</br>   school social life improved slightly.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And the only thing that I don't like is that just because I was</br>   Mexican, they assume a lot of things. Like the first day I got into that</br>   high school, I was called to the principal's office and he asked me, &quot;Are</br>   you in a gang? Why are you wearing those colors?&quot; The same thing! &quot;What</br>   colors? What do you mean?&quot; I was wearing blue this time and then I kind of</br>   got the gist of it, right? So I told him, &quot;Is it because of the blue?</br>   Because this is not my first time, that people are asking me these dumb</br>   questions&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And since that day they thought I was a smart ass, or something</br>   like that. Because I was like…I don't know how to call it, but it was dumb.</br>   A lot of the things, a lot of the attitudes that they had towards almost</br>   everything, was really stupid to me. Like for example, why are you assuming</br>   these things, just because of my shirt? And yeah, that was one thing. And</br>   since I used to draw a lot, I also like street art, graffiti and stuff like</br>   that. And my backpack was actually covered with my own artwork. So they</br>   thought I was the one doing...on that neighborhood.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The graffiti?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They thought I was the one doing graffiti. So,</br>   they just warned me not to do it and not to write any offensive things on</br>   my backpack.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it's interesting, you're talking about this because we do talk to</br>   a lot of men, who go to the United States, when they might be six or seven,</br>   and then they grow up and they do join gangs. I mean a lot of them do join</br>   gangs and do bad stuff, criminal behavior. But you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I didn't ever thought you would. But what do you think drives</br>   those other kids to it and why not you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I think that it was just a matter that my parents are really ignorant</br>   in terms of education—they didn't even finish elementary school—but the one</br>   thing that they did do well, is surround me and my siblings with books. I</br>   think that's like a great thing that they did. Because sometimes I was just</br>   bored of TV. And I will just go to the library—well our own personal</br>   library—and I would just grab a book. We had a bunch of good books…about</br>   sci-fi. I remember The Time Machine by Wells. What other good books? We</br>   have a lot of books, fantasy books, we had The Lord of the Rings. And I</br>   would just grab the thing. And we had a lot of math books. For some reason.</br>   I couldn't understand anything, but it was just fun looking at the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Comic books?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: —a lot of comic books as well. I'm a huge comic book nerd, so</br>   yeah. We had a lot of those, and I would just, surround myself in knowledge and art and whatever. I do think that expands your knowledge or</br>   like at least it gives you some sort of point of view, to realize that you</br>   don't have to necessarily comply to whatever standard society is telling you. So, I</br>   guess, at least for me, that was the difference with the people that</br>   actually join gangs. Because I think that the people that join gangs,</br>   that's a part of the environment—not solely faulty on them, but on society,</br>   because society is fostering those environments. So just, they want to feel</br>   accepted, they want to feel like they have a family in my opinion. So yeah,</br>   I think that was like the only difference. The only real difference.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's interesting. So you graduated from high school, you started a</br>   community college nearby, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then you left?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Talk about the decision.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Well, while I was in high school, the overall feeling that I got from</br>   my counselor was that “He's Mexican and he's lucky if he graduates.” Right?</br>   So I didn't even know what an SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] was. And then</br>   I did the research myself and I realized that I wasn't going to be able to</br>   apply to a real, a four-year college or something like that. And</br>   thankfully I met a guy from, a Puerto Rican guy, from this community</br>   college and he told me, &quot;You know what, you can do your general ed and then</br>   you can decide on studying something.” He just approached me, and he was really</br>   nice. So I went to the community college with hopes of doing general ed and</br>   some art classes and maybe find a way to transfer to CalArts [California</br>   Institute of the Arts] and try to study animation or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And I did that. And the first obstacle was that since I wasn't really</br>   a resident, or even a citizen or whatever, the fee, the tuition for, per</br>   credit was triple. So it was, I had to work a lot just to pay for mediocre</br>   education.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They've changed that now, in California.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: They have, that's what I heard. I was like, [annoyed sound]. It's</br>   okay though. I mean, because my little brother actually graduated and he's</br>   like a mechanic or something. And he has DACA [Deferred Action for</br>   Childhood Arrivals], so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But the funny thing is that with all of those things, his life hasn't</br>   really improved that much. I was still going to school, paying triple, it’s</br>   okay, I don't mind—well I do mind, but I have no choice. So yeah, I'm doing</br>   that and I'm working a lot. And then after a year I realized that, what am</br>   I supposed to do? Am I really going to get into CalArts? I don't have a</br>   social, I don't have an ID, I don't even have a bank account. I don't have</br>   nothing. What am I supposed to do? And it was kind of hard because I had to</br>   give that dream away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You lost hope?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, a little bit. But I mean that was really—fuck, this is the</br>   first time happening [Clearly emotional].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Anyway.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I always like to dance. Right? So I thought, okay, maybe if a</br>   formal education is not from me, I can do something more attainable, that</br>   requires no money and I can still be somebody. So, I decided to start</br>   breakdancing a lot [Choking up]. A lot of hip-hop dancing.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And a lot of breakdancing. I will focus on breakdancing because I saw</br>   these incredible athletes on TV. And I was like, “Oh, this is what I do for</br>   fun. I can really focus on that thing and maybe become a pro. Maybe even</br>   get papers.” But it didn't work out, because competitions were all over the</br>   country and I couldn't move.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You couldn't get on a plane, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So I was really disappointed. I just told my parents, &quot;You know</br>   I'm out. This country doesn't want us here and my dreams keep getting</br>   obstacles and obstacles, I just can't.” They didn't want me to and for two</br>   years they were like really against it. But I mean at the end of the day I</br>   was almost over eighteen, so what could they do, right? So, I came back</br>   with the hopes of going to school, be better. I'm actually the only one in</br>   my family that has a bachelor's. [Emotional] So anyway, I come back because</br>   I want to keep studying and I want to stop that cycle of not being free to do what I</br>   want to do. Because after break dance I was like, what if I become a</br>   firefighter? Never mind, I can't do that. So yeah. And so I came back and I</br>   thought, “Okay, this is going to be…this is going to be kind of difficult.</br>   But I mean I already been here. Right? I already been here and—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you, do for you? Move in with your grandparents?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No. We had a house, we had the same house that I left too, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And with your dad still here?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No my dad actually, cleared things up with my mom and like three</br>   years later, caught up with us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. That's like an important thing that I didn't mention. Yeah. So,</br>   I mean luckily things are well my family now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But I came back and I’m in at a big old house, that was it because</br>   it’s old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I'm there and a lot of people that keep telling me, “You better be</br>   careful you're going to get kidnapped.” They just keep scaring me to the</br>   point that I like set up a decoy on my actual bed and sleep in the closet.</br>   And that is ridiculous, because nothing happened. And it was always here.</br>   And I started going to universities. I had a cousin, so he was like, “Yeah</br>   I'll drive you, or we'll go together, or whatever.” And it was really scary</br>   because like traffic here is nuts. It's like I thought I was going to have</br>   a heart attack every single time I would get on a bus or something, but I</br>   had no option. So anyway, I started going into universities and trying to</br>   apply to private universities because I wasn't even sure if I was going to</br>   be eligible to going to a public university. So they keep telling me that</br>   yeah, definitely if I have the money, but that also I need to formalize my</br>   education by Mexican law, or something like that. And I didn't know</br>   anything about that. So, I had to call my big brother to go to my high</br>   school and ask for a—not my diploma, because I had it—but a transcript. And</br>   go to the Department of State and ask for an apostille thing. And he did,</br>   it took him like two years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Like he did it at the end. And yeah, I was able to get it. And then</br>   here I went to the offices, they have a high school division that takes</br>   care of that. So I went there, and I give them all of my papers and stuff.</br>   I had to translate everything and just pay some dude, some lawyer, to call</br>   me every hour because he didn't speak English. So, I basically paid him, I</br>   did his job and his assignment, and I had to pay him. Anyway, so, yeah,</br>   that happened. And after two years of struggling with that, I was able to</br>   finally have my high school accredited under Mexican law. So finally with</br>   that I get into a private university, a cheap one because I have no real</br>   income.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs, Call Centers, Return to Mexico, Education, College, Relationships, Falling in love, Return to Mexico, Challenges, Continuing education, Records/Transcripts/Diploma">Luis: I mean I work at a call center, but you cannot really work and study   at the same time in Mexico. Because here the idea of a part time job is six   to eight hours. So that's a part time job, anyway. And the regular job is   like ten hours. It's crazy. Anyway, so, I talked to my parents and they're   like, “You know what, we are going to support you, while you do your   university.” And at this time, I also meet a girl, she becomes my partner.   She's still my partner right now. And she just encourages me to apply to a   public school and we applied together and we ended up going to this   university together. And five years later, we finish top of the class and   yeah, it was great. There the sad part is that, the actual degree, I   don't have it because they're giving me some bureaucratic problems because   of my high school. So yeah, this is a ridiculous—one thing after another!    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Continuing education, Records/Transcripts/Diploma, Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in the US">So anyway, I started going into universities and trying to   apply to private universities because I wasn't even sure if I was going to   be eligible to going to a public university.

Like one of my best   friends is American.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Cultural differences, School, High school, Learning English/ ESL, Fitting in/belonging, Feelings, Unbelonging">But yeah, it was   kind of tough. And also, the whole culture kids are not used to, or maybe   just humans, they're not used to like alien things. Because I remember I   didn't know to say “salad.” And when I was at lunch, I will always try to   eat a salad, try to be healthy, but I didn't know it was called a salad.   So, I will just call it green thingy—I think it was my go-to word for   whatever I didn't know. I will just tell them, &quot;Okay, can I have that green   thingy?” And they will give it to me but they would look at me strange. And then one kid got really offended for some   reason, like &quot;It's called a salad dude do you even speak English?” And that   was it, then I got really offended as well. And I was like well, &quot;Of course   not. If I would, I would call it a salad.” It was dumb. But anyway, so   yeah, that was strange. Also like the promiscuity of kids in that high   school was really amusing to me. It's like holy cow, twelve, thirteen year   olds already doing those things?! because my family's like really, is   liberal in the sense that everything's okay, but at the same time they   don't talk about it. So I mean, for me it was like a real shock. And   also malls—malls were super scary. My first time going into a mall was when   I came back. When I was in high school. They're like these massive   buildings and a lot of people there just buying stuff and the flashing colors, it was   crazy. Anyway, it was an experience. And then we moved to an apartment.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">&quot;It's called a salad dude do you even speak English?”</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="needs commas">&quot;It's called a salad dude do you even speak English?”</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife, Living situation">And then we moved from that house because it   was a lot of people, a lot of problems. We're actually living in a garage.   Me, my mom, my uncle and other four people in our garage.     Anne: Your brother?     Luis: My big brother actually moved with my grandfather. So it was just my   mom, my little brother and me and my uncle on that small garage. With other   four people. And it was freezing cold and then super hot. It was really   extreme.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Being secretive, In the shadows, Lost opportunities, Living undocumented, Keeping Secrets">Luis: I kind of stopped.     Anne: Because of the scholarship?     Luis: Yeah. It was kind of like a heart-breaking moment for me. Because my   arts teacher had asked, “Do you do envision yourself going to an art school   program or something?” And I was like, “You know what, I never thought of   that and do I have what it takes!” And, she was definitely pushing me   towards that route. But she didn't know my exact situation and I never told   her because I don't know, I just don't like people pitying me, you know? So   yeah, I kind of stopped and I started dancing after that—just as a   hobby, nothing serious yet.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Pastimes, Art, Music">Anne: Did you start getting interested in art in high school, or before?     Luis: Way before, since the beginning of my life, I was really artistic. So   since the first time I was here I will play piano and then I will try to   draw like comic books and stuff like that as well. I was always really   proficient because I always practice it.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, High school, Bullying, Cultural differences">Also, one of the things   that I remember strongly about high school—my first experience in high   school—is that in Mexico, usually rules are kind of rigid in the sense that   if you're late, you need to knock on the door and ask for permission to   enter the room. So, I did exactly that when I was over there in my first day of high school. I   wasn't confident in my English so it was like really difficult for me and I   did it. And everybody's like, what the hell is this guy doing? I was like,   sorry for being, courteous, I was just trying to not be a douche. Okay. But   then I understood that and then rallies, rallies were like really   interesting because it's like what are we doing in the gym, school spirit   or what do you mean? It was really weird and kids were, kids are bullies.   Most of them even if they're bullied, they want to bully somebody else for   some reason.     Anne: Do they bully you?     Luis: No, well sometimes but not really because I was big, I remember that on my   first rally I was just sitting on top of the bleachers and this small kid just   started grabbing my thigh, right? Doing weird stuff to it. And I told him,   &quot;You need to stop please. You need to stop.” He wouldn't stop. So I just   hit him like this [makes a gesture with his arms] and with the elbow and I just ran away to the bathroom   because I thought I was going to get expelled. So that was, that was   interesting I guess.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Middle school, Fitting in/belonging, Discrimination/stigmatization, School, Making friends, Feelings, Isolation, Unbelonging, Pastimes, Sports, Playing">Luis: Exactly. So yeah, they tell me that, my English is proficient enough   to go to regular school, but my brother and my uncle needs to go to that   specific high school because they have classes for, they have ESL.     Anne: ESL?     Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They went to that school and I will go to this   other high school called ____, but a bus would take them to   ____, in another district. And I wish I would've known that   it was easier over there because the immigrant community is bigger, right?   So you have more people to relate to because the one I was going to, no one   spoke Spanish and the people that knew how to speak Spanish did not want to   speak Spanish. It was like a process of I'm not going to let them know that   I know Spanish. I'm not actually American. And that was very few. I mean   people were very nice. I'm not going to deny that, but at the same time I   couldn't relate to anybody. I became a loner of some sort and I was just   like isolated. Because I was at first, since I didn't talk, I was really   introverted, but then like I blossomed. When I was in middle school and I   was like really extroverted. But then with this change I became introverted   again. So I would just mind my own business and I liked to play basketball a   lot. So I will play basketball. I will do handstands. I liked to be very   physical at the moment. So I would just train you know? It was funny   because for some reason people thought that I was really mysterious like, “That   dude must be a Ninja or something. He's really mysterious. He's just like   doing flips and stuff.” I was really athletic at that moment. Not anymore.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Learning English/ ESL">Luis: So, we got here and my uncle took us to this high school, that was   called ____. That wasn't the nearest high school to our   house. But this high school had specific programs tailored to immigrants.     Anne: Okay.     Luis: So we took a test, an English proficiency test. And it was my   brother, me and my uncle, because my uncle is my age. And so he's like a   brother. So we took the exam and it was, a number out of five. Right? So my   uncle gets one out of five, my brother gets two out of five and I get four   out of five. So I mean, I guess I did good or like they congratulated me,   but afterwards I realized that I should have done worse, but anyway.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Being secretive, Broken system, Lost opportunities, Living undocumented, Not knowing status, Learning status, Documents, Driver’s license, Social security card/ ID, California">Luis: Yeah. And I was super open about my story. I was like, yeah, we just   crossed. I come from Mexico, but I wasn't really aware of the fact that I was   &quot;illegal&quot;. This is just how it happened.     Anne: So how did it dawn on you?     Luis: When I asked if I could be part of a scholarship program   or something like that, I don't remember exactly what it was. It was   something about art because I was—and I'm still—really into art. But I   asked and I remember that some of the requirements were, I don't know. Also   when I was working, because they asked me for a social security number and   stuff like that and I didn't had any or any official IDs. We went to some   dude to take a picture of me and make me an ID. But at the moment I was   oblivious of the fact that it was an illegal ID, it was a fake ID. But then   like after that moment when I wanted to apply to this specific scholarship,   I was like wait a minute. I'm illegal in this country, I cannot apply to   this thing! And yeah, from that point on it was like, I need to be careful,   I don't want to get deported. But actually, California is like a really, or   at least where I was, is like a really chill state. Not in terms of like   people treating you well, but they don't ask. So I mean that's good enough   I guess.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Living undocumented, Not knowing status, Learning status, Time in the US, School, Fitting in/belonging">It was good at first, but then once you   go to school and you talk to other kids, you start to realize that your   life is not the same. That you cannot really relate to some of your peers.   And you cannot do certain things. I didn't realize that I was going back   into the United States as an illegal immigrant until I was actually a   junior in high school.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Arriving in the United States, First impressions, Time in the US, Discrimination/stigmatization, Stereotypes">nd   I remember we stopped—my first experience on the second time—was me   stopping at the gas station and getting down and some dude randomly asking me   if I was in a gang. That was my first experience. And I should've known, I   should’ve known this is not going to go well. Okay. So he just asked me   because I was wearing a red shirt, but I like red, you know, just the   color. So he asked me, “Norteño or something like that?” And I was   like “No, I think I'm from the South.” And he gets all pissed off and   everything and I don't know what the hell is going on. Then luckily he   realizes it. I had literally no clue of what the hell he was saying.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Violence, Domestic violence, Border crossing, Migrants, Family Relationships, Time in the US">So, we were living over there and the conditions were really   poorish. There was some kind of domestic violence ingoing on with my parents.    They were having a lot of issues. So, one of my uncles invited us… “You can    always come and live with me.” And my mom just got fed up of this whole situation   with my dad and so just one night took us all and [Snaps finger] we   disappeared.     Anne: Without your dad?     Luis: Yeah. It was interesting. We went to Tijuana, we stayed with some   dude, I'm guessing he was a coyote or something like that. And then, he   gave us like the shittiest IDs to cross and we did. My mom was super   nervous at the time, but since I was 12, 13, I don't remember. I didn't   know the scope of the seriousness of what we were doing. So, me and my   little brother, we were like, “Ah, it's like whatever.” So yeah, I think   that sold it pretty well to the guy that was checking the IDs. So yeah, we   crossed. And the funny thing is that we were on a shuttle to ____,   that's the name of the town. And we were driving in this freeway and   everybody’s just sitting there really serious, really quiet. And then we   passed a couple immigration officers, and they actually stopped another   shuttle. So, we passed them by, and I could just hear like [Sigh of relief]   and everybody was cheering and stuff and like “Wow.” So it was a funny   moment. It was surreal, like “What is going on?”, “Is everybody   an inmigrant like me?” It was crazy [Laughing].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Crime and Violence, Family, Parents/step-parents, Domestic violence">Yeah, so I was there and then it got a little bit rougher   as time passed. And violence was… just a poor quality of life overall.   Violence, poor services. Because since it's outside of Mexico City in   another state—it's close but it's still another state. It's called an   unprivileged neighborhood or something like that—they have a formal name   for it. So, we were living over there and the conditions were really   poorish. There was some kind of domestic violence ingoing on with my parents.    They were having a lot of issues. So, one of my uncles invited us… “You can    always come and live with me.” And my mom just got fed up of this whole situation   with my dad and so just one night took us all and [Snaps finger] we   disappeared.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Paying For, Violence, Time in the US, Gangs, Fear of, Family, Siblings">Luis: Yeah. I never went to school because they were like deciding should   we enroll them, should we not? Should we go back? Because the first time we   left the States, it was because there was a lot of gangs as well [Chuckle],   so it was like running away from violence, which is ironic because the   second time I went back is because we were running away from violence,   again. It seems that violence follows us.     Anne: So were they worried about—     Luis: They worried about my big brother going—     Anne: Your big brother?     Luis: —going into like a gang or something like that. Because you know how   the media kind of tells you what you're supposed to be over there—you're   Mexican, so you're supposed to be like a Cholo, or something like that. So   yeah, that kind of mentality wasn't really down with my parents. So they   were like, you might as well leave.     </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">it might have.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">Read musical?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Arriving in the United States, Learning English, Homelife, Pastimes, Music, Playing, Pastimes,  watching TV">Well, a funny thing is that I never spoke   until I was six, so they thought I was autistic or something. I never ever   spoke. I would just watch TV. I mean, I would understand everything, but I   didn't speak at all. So I don't know if it's like a repercussion of the   whole experience, but I mean that's interesting I guess.     Anne: Very interesting.     Luis: Yeah. I would just watch TV and play piano because they had a little   piano in the house.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Parents/step-parents, Jobs">Anne: Were your parents working?

Well so, the first time, when I was a kid and I didn't even   know that I wasn't really American. So, I just grew up normally. My uncle's   partner at the moment was really nice—she was American—and she was an   incredible person. She was really caring. So, she would take care of us and   we would just watch TV, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers. And to   me language was just whatever. So we just learned naturally English and   Spanish. I just thought it was the same language, because we were speaking    both back and forth at my house. So yeah, it wasn't hard at all. That's how I   learned English. And in terms of like really fitting in, I was so little   that I don't really remember exactly. But I mean they were good   times. I didn't work, I didn't go to school, I was just watching   TV.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Migration from Mexico, Border crossing">Anne: And you said you went with a woman who had papers for you.     Luis: Yeah, we didn't even know that lady. My parents were like, can   you please cross my baby boy, we're going to cross over here. You could do   it legally and it's going to be easier. And yeah, it was actually easier   and I was lucky then, because I was given back.     Anne: Yes.     Luis: And yeah, that's how we got there.     Anne: And you had siblings with you too?     Luis: Yes, I had a little brother. So I was definitely one, because my   little brother is one year younger than me. So yeah, I was with my big brother   who's four years older and my little brother who's one year younger than me.     Anne: [Affirmative noise]     Luis: So yeah, everybody crossed. Yeah, so she crossed me and my little   brother who were actually given to this lady.</span> And we got there, my uncle</br>   was already there, and we got into an apartment and we were living with</br>   them in ____ for my first years. Should I continue, or what else? Like</br>   the whole story just kind of?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You just continue on.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Super long.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well, just talk about how you learned English and—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: —integrated to the community that first time and then why you went</br>   back up.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Okay.

My dad was working in a pizzeria,</br>   and my mom was a waiter. My big brother was going to school at that moment,</br>   so it was just me and my little brother and my aunt in the apartment.

Was that hard?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: That wasn't hard actually. Because I always saw English and Spanish</br>   as one language. But for my big brother that was really difficult for</br>   him cause he couldn't even write Spanish. It was just really easy to adapt</br>   for me and my little brother, because we never went to school. We just had</br>   to skip a couple of years in Mexico. I don't know how my parents did it,</br>   but we did it, and—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Now you were back in your original village? Your hometown?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It was still kind of dangerous, but it wasn't as bad as before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I currently live there.

Probably looked older.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So people were always thinking I was older. That's how I was</br>   able to work, since I was like 13.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. So yeah, well we go back to the house. I know</br>   English, but I don't really speak it that well. I understand everything</br>   though. Everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well you never spoke till you're six.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative sound]. Exactly. It was good at first, but then once you</br>   go to school and you talk to other kids, you start to realize that your</br>   life is not the same. That you cannot really relate to some of your peers.</br>   And you cannot do certain things. I didn't realize that I was going back</br>   into the United States as an illegal immigrant until I was actually a</br>   junior in high school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said you started high school when you went to the U.S.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so two years went by, you're going to school—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah.

But then</br>   like after that moment when I wanted to apply to this specific scholarship,</br>   I was like wait a minute. I'm illegal in this country, I cannot apply to</br>   this thing! And yeah, from that point on it was like, I need to be careful,</br>   I don't want to get deported. But actually, California is like a really, or</br>   at least where I was, is like a really chill state. Not in terms of like</br>   people treating you well, but they don't ask. So I mean that's good enough</br>   I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, is school really different when you came to the States versus</br>   when you were in school in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: When we got here it was like on summer vacation I think—well between</br>   school years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So, it was perfect for us to just enroll for the next year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So, we got here and my uncle took us to this high school, that was</br>   called ____. That wasn't the nearest high school to our</br>   house. But this high school had specific programs tailored to immigrants.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So we took a test, an English proficiency test. And it was my</br>   brother, me and my uncle, because my uncle is my age. And so he's like a</br>   brother. So we took the exam and it was, a number out of five. Right? So my</br>   uncle gets one out of five, my brother gets two out of five and I get four</br>   out of five. So I mean, I guess I did good or like they congratulated me,</br>   but afterwards I realized that I should have done worse, but anyway.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And do it again.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I would have gotten-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: More help.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Exactly. So yeah, they tell me that, my English is proficient enough</br>   to go to regular school, but my brother and my uncle needs to go to that</br>   specific high school because they have classes for, they have ESL.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: ESL?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They went to that school and I will go to this</br>   other high school called ____, but a bus would take them to</br>   ____, in another district. And I wish I would've known that</br>   it was easier over there because the immigrant community is bigger, right?</br>   So you have more people to relate to because the one I was going to, no one</br>   spoke Spanish and the people that knew how to speak Spanish did not want to</br>   speak Spanish. It was like a process of I'm not going to let them know that</br>   I know Spanish. I'm not actually American. And that was very few. I mean</br>   people were very nice. I'm not going to deny that, but at the same time I</br>   couldn't relate to anybody. I became a loner of some sort and I was just</br>   like isolated. Because I was at first, since I didn't talk, I was really</br>   introverted, but then like I blossomed. When I was in middle school and I</br>   was like really extroverted. But then with this change I became introverted</br>   again. So I would just mind my own business and I liked to play basketball a</br>   lot. So I will play basketball. I will do handstands. I liked to be very</br>   physical at the moment. So I would just train you know? It was funny</br>   because for some reason people thought that I was really mysterious like, “That</br>   dude must be a Ninja or something. He's really mysterious. He's just like</br>   doing flips and stuff.” I was really athletic at that moment. Not anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I'm sure you're still athletic, you just have to practice.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So it was, that was that it was really tough. I didn't have any</br>   friends. I had one friend, but I think he was only my friend because he</br>   didn't have friends—so, it was like a pity case. Also, one of the things</br>   that I remember strongly about high school—my first experience in high</br>   school—is that in Mexico, usually rules are kind of rigid in the sense that</br>   if you're late, you need to knock on the door and ask for permission to</br>   enter the room. So, I did exactly that when I was over there in my first day of high school. I</br>   wasn't confident in my English so it was like really difficult for me and I</br>   did it. And everybody's like, what the hell is this guy doing? I was like,</br>   sorry for being, courteous, I was just trying to not be a douche. Okay. But</br>   then I understood that and then rallies, rallies were like really</br>   interesting because it's like what are we doing in the gym, school spirit</br>   or what do you mean? It was really weird and kids were, kids are bullies.</br>   Most of them even if they're bullied, they want to bully somebody else for</br>   some reason.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do they bully you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, well sometimes but not really because I was big, I remember that on my</br>   first rally I was just sitting on top of the bleachers and this small kid just</br>   started grabbing my thigh, right? Doing weird stuff to it. And I told him,</br>   &quot;You need to stop please. You need to stop.” He wouldn't stop. So I just</br>   hit him like this [makes a gesture with his arms] and with the elbow and I just ran away to the bathroom</br>   because I thought I was going to get expelled. So that was, that was</br>   interesting I guess. And yeah, so it was really tough. The first year on</br>   that high school and I was living with like ten other people on that house.</br>   That was my uncle's house. That was before the real estate bubble in ‘08.</br>   So my uncle was doing pretty good. He was on, on real estate, doing real</br>   estate.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So he was doing pretty well. Pretty good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And he had that house, he had his house and he had another house, but</br>   he lost everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you start getting interested in art in high school, or before?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Way before, since the beginning of my life, I was really artistic. So</br>   since the first time I was here I will play piano and then I will try to</br>   draw like comic books and stuff like that as well. I was always really</br>   proficient because I always practice it. Yeah. Man, what else?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And in high school you had the opportunity at least for a while to do</br>   art and then the scholarship.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Actually, in high school I stopped.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, you did?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I kind of stopped.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because of the scholarship?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It was kind of like a heart-breaking moment for me. Because my</br>   arts teacher had asked, “Do you do envision yourself going to an art school</br>   program or something?” And I was like, “You know what, I never thought of</br>   that and do I have what it takes!” And, she was definitely pushing me</br>   towards that route. But she didn't know my exact situation and I never told</br>   her because I don't know, I just don't like people pitying me, you know? So</br>   yeah, I kind of stopped and I started dancing after that—just as a</br>   hobby, nothing serious yet. And then we moved from that house because it</br>   was a lot of people, a lot of problems. We're actually living in a garage.</br>   Me, my mom, my uncle and other four people in our garage.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: My big brother actually moved with my grandfather. So it was just my</br>   mom, my little brother and me and my uncle on that small garage. With other</br>   four people. And it was freezing cold and then super hot. It was really</br>   extreme. Anyway, those first years were really tough because I couldn't</br>   really talk to people. I didn't have friends at school. The high school that I went to, is supposed to be the closest</br>   to my house, but it was forty minutes away walking. And yeah, I don't</br>   really have a choice. So I had to walk. So yeah, sometimes it would rain</br>   and I had to cross a field of strawberries to get into the high school. I</br>   mean, it was good when there were strawberries.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, I was just going to say.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, exactly. I needed to wash them though. But yeah, it was</br>   kind of tough. And also, the whole culture kids are not used to, or maybe</br>   just humans, they're not used to like alien things. Because I remember I</br>   didn't know to say “salad.” And when I was at lunch, I will always try to</br>   eat a salad, try to be healthy, but I didn't know it was called a salad.</br>   So, I will just call it green thingy—I think it was my go-to word for</br>   whatever I didn't know. I will just tell them, &quot;Okay, can I have that green</br>   thingy?” And they will give it to me but they would look at me strange. And then one kid got really offended for some</br>   reason, like &quot;It's called a salad dude do you even speak English?” And that</br>   was it, then I got really offended as well. And I was like well, &quot;Of course</br>   not. If I would, I would call it a salad.” It was dumb. But anyway, so</br>   yeah, that was strange. Also like the promiscuity of kids in that high</br>   school was really amusing to me. It's like holy cow, twelve, thirteen year</br>   olds already doing those things?! because my family's like really, is</br>   liberal in the sense that everything's okay, but at the same time they</br>   don't talk about it. So I mean, for me it was like a real shock. And</br>   also malls—malls were super scary. My first time going into a mall was when</br>   I came back. When I was in high school. They're like these massive</br>   buildings and a lot of people there just buying stuff and the flashing colors, it was</br>   crazy. Anyway, it was an experience. And then we moved to an apartment.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Same high school?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, the other one, the ____, the one that had a</br>   bigger immigrant community.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So then you transferred?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise] I transferred to that one. At first my mom was</br>   really against it because supposedly this one was better.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But it was just misconceptions. This high school is better because it</br>   doesn't have a lot of Mexicans… just unfunded things. So yeah, I then</br>   transferred to the other one. And the ironic thing, at least for my mom, is</br>   that I didn't really have any close Mexican friends. They were immigrants,</br>   but they were not Mexicans. And it's not because I didn't wanted to. It's</br>   because, I didn't feel that I fit in with that Mexican culture. I still</br>   don't feel like I fit in with Mexican values and culture, or with American</br>   beliefs. I don't really like either. So, I ended up being really good</br>   friends with a lot of Asian people actually. Korean people have really</br>   similar experiences—Korean people, Vietnamese people, Filipinos- with</br>   Mexicans. So it was like really interesting to know all of that people.</br>   It's actually beautiful, like a beautiful cultural exchange. I think you</br>   grow as a person. And I also had like American friends. Like one of my best</br>   friends is American. So, anyway, so we were over there, and we're</br>   supposed to be living in really shitty apartments. So, I was expecting like</br>   really horrible walls and rats everywhere and cockroaches— they told me</br>   that it was supposed to be like a bad neighborhood. But it was actually</br>   pretty good. I thought I was rich. So, we were</br>   living over there and I spent my senior year in that place. So luckily, my</br>   school social life improved slightly.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And the only thing that I don't like is that just because I was</br>   Mexican, they assume a lot of things. Like the first day I got into that</br>   high school, I was called to the principal's office and he asked me, &quot;Are</br>   you in a gang? Why are you wearing those colors?&quot; The same thing! &quot;What</br>   colors? What do you mean?&quot; I was wearing blue this time and then I kind of</br>   got the gist of it, right? So I told him, &quot;Is it because of the blue?</br>   Because this is not my first time, that people are asking me these dumb</br>   questions&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And since that day they thought I was a smart ass, or something</br>   like that. Because I was like…I don't know how to call it, but it was dumb.</br>   A lot of the things, a lot of the attitudes that they had towards almost</br>   everything, was really stupid to me. Like for example, why are you assuming</br>   these things, just because of my shirt? And yeah, that was one thing. And</br>   since I used to draw a lot, I also like street art, graffiti and stuff like</br>   that. And my backpack was actually covered with my own artwork. So they</br>   thought I was the one doing...on that neighborhood.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The graffiti?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They thought I was the one doing graffiti. So,</br>   they just warned me not to do it and not to write any offensive things on</br>   my backpack.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, it's interesting, you're talking about this because we do talk to</br>   a lot of men, who go to the United States, when they might be six or seven,</br>   and then they grow up and they do join gangs. I mean a lot of them do join</br>   gangs and do bad stuff, criminal behavior. But you didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I didn't ever thought you would. But what do you think drives</br>   those other kids to it and why not you?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I think that it was just a matter that my parents are really ignorant</br>   in terms of education—they didn't even finish elementary school—but the one</br>   thing that they did do well, is surround me and my siblings with books. I</br>   think that's like a great thing that they did. Because sometimes I was just</br>   bored of TV. And I will just go to the library—well our own personal</br>   library—and I would just grab a book. We had a bunch of good books…about</br>   sci-fi. I remember The Time Machine by Wells. What other good books? We</br>   have a lot of books, fantasy books, we had The Lord of the Rings. And I</br>   would just grab the thing. And we had a lot of math books. For some reason.</br>   I couldn't understand anything, but it was just fun looking at the—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Comic books?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: —a lot of comic books as well. I'm a huge comic book nerd, so</br>   yeah. We had a lot of those, and I would just, surround myself in knowledge and art and whatever. I do think that expands your knowledge or</br>   like at least it gives you some sort of point of view, to realize that you</br>   don't have to necessarily comply to whatever standard society is telling you. So, I</br>   guess, at least for me, that was the difference with the people that</br>   actually join gangs. Because I think that the people that join gangs,</br>   that's a part of the environment—not solely faulty on them, but on society,</br>   because society is fostering those environments. So just, they want to feel</br>   accepted, they want to feel like they have a family in my opinion. So yeah,</br>   I think that was like the only difference. The only real difference.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's interesting. So you graduated from high school, you started a</br>   community college nearby, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then you left?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Talk about the decision.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Well, while I was in high school, the overall feeling that I got from</br>   my counselor was that “He's Mexican and he's lucky if he graduates.” Right?</br>   So I didn't even know what an SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] was. And then</br>   I did the research myself and I realized that I wasn't going to be able to</br>   apply to a real, a four-year college or something like that. And</br>   thankfully I met a guy from, a Puerto Rican guy, from this community</br>   college and he told me, &quot;You know what, you can do your general ed and then</br>   you can decide on studying something.” He just approached me, and he was really</br>   nice. So I went to the community college with hopes of doing general ed and</br>   some art classes and maybe find a way to transfer to CalArts [California</br>   Institute of the Arts] and try to study animation or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And I did that. And the first obstacle was that since I wasn't really</br>   a resident, or even a citizen or whatever, the fee, the tuition for, per</br>   credit was triple. So it was, I had to work a lot just to pay for mediocre</br>   education.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They've changed that now, in California.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: They have, that's what I heard. I was like, [annoyed sound]. It's</br>   okay though. I mean, because my little brother actually graduated and he's</br>   like a mechanic or something. And he has DACA [Deferred Action for</br>   Childhood Arrivals], so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But the funny thing is that with all of those things, his life hasn't</br>   really improved that much. I was still going to school, paying triple, it’s</br>   okay, I don't mind—well I do mind, but I have no choice. So yeah, I'm doing</br>   that and I'm working a lot. And then after a year I realized that, what am</br>   I supposed to do? Am I really going to get into CalArts? I don't have a</br>   social, I don't have an ID, I don't even have a bank account. I don't have</br>   nothing. What am I supposed to do? And it was kind of hard because I had to</br>   give that dream away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You lost hope?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, a little bit. But I mean that was really—fuck, this is the</br>   first time happening [Clearly emotional].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Anyway.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I always like to dance. Right? So I thought, okay, maybe if a</br>   formal education is not from me, I can do something more attainable, that</br>   requires no money and I can still be somebody. So, I decided to start</br>   breakdancing a lot [Choking up]. A lot of hip-hop dancing.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And a lot of breakdancing. I will focus on breakdancing because I saw</br>   these incredible athletes on TV. And I was like, “Oh, this is what I do for</br>   fun. I can really focus on that thing and maybe become a pro. Maybe even</br>   get papers.” But it didn't work out, because competitions were all over the</br>   country and I couldn't move.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You couldn't get on a plane, right?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So I was really disappointed. I just told my parents, &quot;You know</br>   I'm out. This country doesn't want us here and my dreams keep getting</br>   obstacles and obstacles, I just can't.” They didn't want me to and for two</br>   years they were like really against it. But I mean at the end of the day I</br>   was almost over eighteen, so what could they do, right? So, I came back</br>   with the hopes of going to school, be better. I'm actually the only one in</br>   my family that has a bachelor's. [Emotional] So anyway, I come back because</br>   I want to keep studying and I want to stop that cycle of not being free to do what I</br>   want to do. Because after break dance I was like, what if I become a</br>   firefighter? Never mind, I can't do that. So yeah. And so I came back and I</br>   thought, “Okay, this is going to be…this is going to be kind of difficult.</br>   But I mean I already been here. Right? I already been here and—&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you, do for you? Move in with your grandparents?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No. We had a house, we had the same house that I left too, so.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And with your dad still here?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No my dad actually, cleared things up with my mom and like three</br>   years later, caught up with us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. That's like an important thing that I didn't mention. Yeah. So,</br>   I mean luckily things are well my family now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: But I came back and I’m in at a big old house, that was it because</br>   it’s old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I'm there and a lot of people that keep telling me, “You better be</br>   careful you're going to get kidnapped.” They just keep scaring me to the</br>   point that I like set up a decoy on my actual bed and sleep in the closet.</br>   And that is ridiculous, because nothing happened. And it was always here.</br>   And I started going to universities. I had a cousin, so he was like, “Yeah</br>   I'll drive you, or we'll go together, or whatever.” And it was really scary</br>   because like traffic here is nuts. It's like I thought I was going to have</br>   a heart attack every single time I would get on a bus or something, but I</br>   had no option. So anyway, I started going into universities and trying to</br>   apply to private universities because I wasn't even sure if I was going to</br>   be eligible to going to a public university. So they keep telling me that</br>   yeah, definitely if I have the money, but that also I need to formalize my</br>   education by Mexican law, or something like that. And I didn't know</br>   anything about that. So, I had to call my big brother to go to my high</br>   school and ask for a—not my diploma, because I had it—but a transcript. And</br>   go to the Department of State and ask for an apostille thing. And he did,</br>   it took him like two years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Like he did it at the end. And yeah, I was able to get it. And then</br>   here I went to the offices, they have a high school division that takes</br>   care of that. So I went there, and I give them all of my papers and stuff.</br>   I had to translate everything and just pay some dude, some lawyer, to call</br>   me every hour because he didn't speak English. So, I basically paid him, I</br>   did his job and his assignment, and I had to pay him. Anyway, so, yeah,</br>   that happened. And after two years of struggling with that, I was able to</br>   finally have my high school accredited under Mexican law. So finally with</br>   that I get into a private university, a cheap one because I have no real</br>   income.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I mean I work at a call center, but you cannot really work and study</br>   at the same time in Mexico. Because here the idea of a part time job is six</br>   to eight hours. So that's a part time job, anyway. And the regular job is</br>   like ten hours. It's crazy. Anyway, so, I talked to my parents and they're</br>   like, “You know what, we are going to support you, while you do your</br>   university.” And at this time, I also meet a girl, she becomes my partner.</br>   She's still my partner right now. And she just encourages me to apply to a</br>   public school and we applied together and we ended up going to this</br>   university together. And five years later, we finish top of the class and</br>   yeah, it was great. There the sad part is that, the actual degree, I</br>   don't have it because they're giving me some bureaucratic problems because</br>   of my high school. So yeah, this is a ridiculous—one thing after another!</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you study?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh? I'm an economics professor.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yes! [Anne laughs]. I really like economics. Like everything in life</br>   is economics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah and my girlfriend studied the same. And she has the same problem</br>   actually, but not because she is an immigrant, just because she did</br>   homeschool.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. And they don't want to validate her studies,</br>   even though it's already been validated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Because you graduated from college.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, exactly! Anyway, so we were struggling with that right now. But</br>   I got really excited, I thought I was going to make it after college, but</br>   just the market in Mexico, the labor market, there's so much. There's a lot</br>   of supply, cheap labor.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: People need jobs.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. That allows companies to pretty much set up the</br>   rules—“We're going to pay you low wages and if you want it, good, if you</br>   dont, there's a lot of people waiting, so...[Goodbye gesture]”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's rough.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. So, I noticed that you cannot really be, an economist,</br>   unless you know the right people—unless you can hook up with somebody in</br>   the government. So yeah, I was doing like really menial, administrative</br>   work and I was really depressed because so much effort and coming back and</br>   just feeling stuck, just like in the U.S. That's when I web searched, how to</br>   improve my life and I found ____. I actually found ____ that way</br>   and I applied the same day. The next week I quit my job and I just started</br>   studying programming and now yeah, here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you like it?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I love it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah, I do love it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And right now you're graduating. Do you have a job waiting once—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I do have a couple of interviews scheduled, because I think that my</br>   specific background helps a lot, since I have knowledge in design and I have really strong</br>   math abilities—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Economics.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah. It correlates very well with the requirements for a computer</br>   science student or something like that. So just the whole programming thing</br>   is really easy to me, to understand.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So, I advance really fast. So I do have very good job offers.</br>   Actually it's great because my salary can improve three times as much as</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I mean I'm loving it right now. I'm really grateful with all the</br>   code. And finally with people that are actually trying to do something with</br>   immigrants. Because when I was here, literally none, zero programs geared</br>   towards returnees, or the deported people, or whatever. The only thing that</br>   will help you is call centers and it's not really help. They just want to</br>   exploit you. So, yeah, I'm really glad that stuff like this is happening.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's wonderful.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when do you think you'll start work?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Most likely this month. Because I already had got an offer, but I was</br>   advised not to take that offer because they were underpaying me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: So I didn't take that offer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you're still—</br> </br> </br>   Luis: I'm still looking for a better option.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Is your partner also, did she do ____ too, or?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: No, she's working right now. She has a job, but it's still hard</br>   because her family suffers a lot from violence from their own family</br>   members. So, they're kind of dealing with a lot of legal issues. So yeah.</br>   Basically, I want to work hard and support them. Because I mean, it costs</br>   money to maintain such ordeals. But yeah, that's basically my story, I</br>   guess.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are your dreams now? I mean you talked a bit about your</br>   dreams in the U.S how they kept getting sort of barriers and you'd have to</br>   cut back, what about now on your dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Oh, right now I'm really ambitious. I noticed that nothing's going to</br>   be given to me and I need to take what I want. So right now, I just want to</br>   be the best programmer in Mexico City. And I think I can achieve it. And</br>   even, I don't know, move somewhere else… somewhere where my values, because</br>   I have really different values from like Mexican people, I'm really</br>   disciplined, I'm really honest. I'm extremely... I don't know how to say</br>   it. I'm really different, I guess. Even when people throw cigarettes on the</br>   floor it really bothers me. So, yeah, move somewhere like, I don't know,</br>   Singapore or something, where they're really strict because that's how I</br>   am. My dream is just to maybe move with her and her family—so they can</br>   avoid so much violence as well—to somewhere else. Maybe even Canada. Canada</br>   sounds good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where did you get those values? Was it the U.S.? Was it family? Was</br>   it your meeting? Where do you think you got those values?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Honestly, I do think it was reading. I do think it was all the books</br>   because unlike me, my family is really different. We don't listen</br>   to the same music. I'm the only one who's artistically inclined. I just</br>   think that the key to a better society is definitely education. Definitely.</br>   Because it changes lives.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the United States made you different than you</br>   would have been if you'd stayed in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Definitely. It was really bad most of the time. But those experiences</br>   made me the person that I am right now. So, I wouldn't change it. And I do</br>   think that it played a big role in building my character and my personality</br>   and in-depth values that I have.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about the Mexican government? What do you think they can do?</br>   What should they be doing to help returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Well, first of all, just create something like ESL [English as a</br>   Second Language], like Spanish as a second language. I was lucky, but a lot</br>   of my peers, they can barely speak Spanish and they're</br>   supposed to be Mexican. And everything is in Spanish here—nothing is in</br>   English. At least in the States a lot of documents are in Spanish or even</br>   other languages. But in here, that's really hard. So, I would really</br>   encourage the Mexican government to create some sort of program that</br>   teaches deportees and immigrants Spanish as a second language. What else?</br>   Some sort of way to speedy up bureaucratic processes to get your birth</br>   certificate, IDs, and even bank accounts. ____ actually helps us out</br>   getting bank accounts, so that's really great. I think they could do that.</br>   What else they could do? Just exploit the skills that these people</br>   have—they speak English and they speak it incredibly well. That's just a</br>   waste of talent right there, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Of course.</br> </br> </br>   Luis: And yeah, I think those are like—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Okay, well we're pretty much done. But is there</br>   anything that you'd like to share at the end, that you haven't said yet?</br> </br> </br>   Luis: Well I don't know. I just think that the U.S.— they don't say it and</br>   it’s never going to be said—but immigration, illegal immigration in the</br>   United States is a business. They require that cheap labor. And right now</br>   the only thing that they are trying to do is just to balance things out the</br>   way they want it. Because illegal immigration is still going to be a thing, I</br>   think, forever because they need people to exploit. Because at the end</br>   of the day, we live in a capitalist society. And I understand that for me</br>   to have these Calvin Klein shoes that I bought at Payless, somebody</br>   else had suffer. For me to have a good life, somebody else needs to have a</br>   bad life and that's just how the world works. But I think that just</br>   understanding that fact and understanding that immigrant people in the U.S</br>   are more than just assets. They are people, they have dreams. They could be</br>   like a positive force for the communities. And just, I don't know. It's</br>   just as difficult, because money rules the world I guess. And at the end of</br>   the day, a lot of companies just don't care and they want cheap labor. And</br>   a lot of people just want to pay less. Just understanding that things are</br>   this way, that your wonderful life is wonderful because other people</br>   suffer. I think that's just a huge, big step towards a better, more equal</br>   society. Yeah, that's pretty much it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That was great.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
