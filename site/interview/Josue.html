No papers.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you apply for political asylum in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, no I did not.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How would you describe your English skills when you got to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Zero. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you learn English while you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I did, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Where at? School, community, work?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, myself. I got made fun of in PE class. We were in Seattle, so</br>   not a lot of non-English, well, Spanish speaking people. But yeah, I got</br>   made fun of my English in PE. ‘Cause I remember I was wearing like an Old</br>   Navy shirt with an American flag right here. And there was a guy in my PE</br>   class, which were the classes that were not ESL, so it was mostly white</br>   people. And so, I remember him saying something to the effect of, “How were</br>   you even wearing that when you can't even speak the language?”</br> </br> </br>   Josue: And so, I actually started to, what I would do is that I would get</br>   music. I listened to a lot of music with a Spanish-English dictionary and</br>   me sitting in my living room with that, a lot. And I was the first one in</br>   my family to speak it. I don't even think a year went by before I remember</br>   speaking where I felt comfortable I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, good motivation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So how would you describe your English now?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I think it's good. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah, fluent?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, yeah. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You understand everything I'm saying?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I do, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And what cities did you live in? You mentioned ___?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: ____ Washington was the only one.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: _____ Washington?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah. that area.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you go to school in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I did, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Up to what year?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I was in college, _____ for about a year and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, college. What did you study in college?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Culinary arts.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Culinary arts. That's pretty cool.</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, I mean I like cooking, but not working in a restaurant.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have to pay for the school or how was the financial aid</br>   situation?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh no, I had to pay, I used to work. I would work delivering</br>   newspapers at night ____yeah, so that's what I did. So I would get home and</br>   then run to school. I mean the very first quarter my dad paid for that, but</br>   then the rest I did.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What other kinds of jobs did you have there?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I didn't have many ‘cause that one, I had it for a couple of years.</br>   But then for almost four years I worked for this company called ____. But</br>   it was for delivering medicine to independent pharmacies. So every day I</br>   would go do my route and it was just delivering those little boxes of</br>   medicine in them for about four years.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Four years. So you worked total, how many years being in the US,</br>   how many years did you work?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I'd say six. Six years, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How did you work? Did they never ask for your papers?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, my dad is still working in the newspaper ‘cause it's okay money</br>   and it's just a few hours. So, he's still working there so I don't think</br>   they really check papers there—you know, social security and stuff. And</br>   with the other one, with _____, they actually had a manager there when I</br>   first got in. It was actually my dad that was going to get the job, but we</br>   started talking with the manager and he was Latino—I don't know what he</br>   was. But I think he kind of knew what the situation was until years later.</br>   Me and my dad actually worked there at some point, both of us. But then</br>   they changed management and that's when they started checking things. By</br>   that time, I was already in detention. My dad told me they started checking</br>   staff and that job was no more. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, in your last job that you had in the US, how much were you</br>   earning per hour?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, I didn't earn hourly. I used to earn like $1,600 every other</br>   week.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: $1,600 for two weeks?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, every two weeks. It was a good job.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And who did you live with while you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: My dad, well my entire family the entire time.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Siblings, brothers, and sisters?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yes. All of them, except for my mom. She was there for about half</br>   the time, for about five years. And then she came back here ‘cause she</br>   didn't like working over there. You know the jobs that you get over there.</br>   Like I said, I didn't feel like we were in a bad position where we needed</br>   to go through everything that we went through. So my mom came back.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, what happened to the family after she left?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh, my parents split. Well, I think they were already splitting, and</br>   you know, whenever she said, “I'm going back with my little sister.” Yeah,</br>   that was like, “Okay, yeah, they're splitting.”</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: They're splitting?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And how did that impact you growing up there?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Honestly, not really. Because when she came back, I kind of already</br>   knew that it was going to happen, and I wasn't that young to already not</br>   really understand what was happening. So, my mom told me she wasn't happy</br>   over there and I wanted her to be happy, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, when you were living in the US you were living with your</br>   parents, your siblings, any other relatives or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, it was just us.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Were you ever worried about getting caught by US authorities?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: A little bit. But the stories that I heard, they didn't really feel</br>   like they were hitting too close to home until I started hearing about the</br>   warehouse for the newspaper. They did a raid over there. And that's the</br>   first summer I was like, “I don't know.” But we kept on going and I didn't</br>   experience a raid like that.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, the warehouse got raided?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And you weren't working there anymore?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No. The thing is that we all worked there: me, my mom, my brother.</br>   Me, at one point, I was working with my mom on one route and my dad was</br>   doing another one. At some point, we all had one, and it had to be at the</br>   point when only my dad was working there ‘cause I remember he was the one</br>   to tell me about that. And so, I know that for some time, he would be the</br>   one to go and bring the newspapers to us. And you know, just take them up.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah. So your dad didn't get caught in that raid?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, no, no, no. I know that he knew about it, but I don't think he</br>   was there at that moment.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Well that's good. Did you ever send money to your relatives in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No. No, I'm not that close.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How long did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: 11 years?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: 11 years. Did you follow US political news while you were living in</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: News? Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And how'd you follow it?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Newspaper. We always had leftover. Newspaper every day. [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Seattle Times?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's funny. Any other way that you followed the news?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Well, I mean more so more recently, through the phone. But back</br>   then, it was with a newspaper.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Just newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, while you were in the United States, did you follow Mexican</br>   political news?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you qualify for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I don't know. I think that I could have because I did all of my high</br>   school there and college as well. But I never really looked into it. And</br>   what's funny is before I actually came to Mexico, about a year before, I</br>   called my mom and I told her that I wanted to come back. So like nine</br>   months after that, that's when I got caught. So first I had bail, and then</br>   whenever I had my meeting with a judge, like my hearing, she asked</br>   me—'cause I was like the only one in the room that they didn't need a</br>   translator—she was like, “Are you sure you don't want to fight your case?”</br> </br> </br>   Josue: But there were so many people there that I knew, maybe they were in</br>   my situation where they could have qualified, but they had been there for</br>   years, or you know like a year or something. I didn't think it was worth</br>   it. So I signed my voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, on this topic of getting caught, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh, it was really stupid [Chuckle] Because I was driving my dad's</br>   car, and I went to a friend’s in downtown Seattle. Left the car parked in a</br>   parking lot, and then I went to my friend's house, or whatever. I was</br>   coming back and I didn't have my driver's license with me—I forgot it that</br>   day. And so, somebody I guess called the cops saying that maybe I looked</br>   suspicious or something because the cops came, they got me, I didn't have</br>   my ID, the car wasn't under my name. And so they said that they were</br>   charging me with car prowling, which at the end they dropped everything</br>   because that was not the case. And yeah, that's what happened. They took me</br>   in.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, the police detained you?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, it was the cops. And so, they got me and then I spent a few</br>   days in County. Ain't nobody told me anything. Like I would ask, like “Why</br>   am I exactly here? Can I speak with somebody?” And they kept on telling me,</br>   like “Oh, you're going to get your hearing,” whatever. But I never did. A</br>   few days after that, ICE came and you know they start asking like, “When</br>   did you come in? What's your social security number?” All those questions.</br>   And then they left. A couple of days after that, they came back, but you</br>   know already with the shackles and everything for a bunch of people. And</br>   that's how they took us down to the detention center in Tacoma.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What year was this, that that happened?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: 13? 2013.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, you never actually went before a judge for this case that the</br>   cop stopped you for?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Never. I had a persecutor right there when I had my hearing in ICE,</br>   with a judge, cause I told her, she asked me, “Do you want to fight the</br>   case? You want to do something?” I said, “No.” And I told her I just want</br>   to sign the voluntary departure. As soon as I said that, the guy to the</br>   left, he was like, “No, like he has charges.” They wanted to deport me,</br>   which wouldn't have made a difference really for me ‘cause I'm not going</br>   back. But he said, like “He's got this, charges,” whatever. I don't know</br>   how they can call them charges when they never really charged me with</br>   anything ‘cause I never had a hearing on it. And so then I explained</br>   exactly what I said to you. I told the judge, she turned and looked at him</br>   and the guy said, “Okay, we're deferring the charges.” That's just what he</br>   said. And she said, okay, she signed it. That's it. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's wild.</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It was.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, they just looked at you and they were like, “Okay, we're</br>   dropping everything?”</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The persecutor just said, he used that term,</br>   “We're not dropping the charges, we're deferring the charges,” something</br>   like that. She said, “Okay,” signed it. And that's how I got the voluntary</br>   one.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, were you informed of your rights during this process?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, I would say no. No because whenever I explained it to the judge,</br>   I told her like, “Whenever I was in county, nobody ever told me anything. I</br>   didn't know anything of whether we're charging me with. Whenever ICE came,</br>   same thing. They just took me and didn't say anything.”</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have a lawyer helping you through it?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, no. ‘Cause like I said, I didn't want to fight anything.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you weren’t provided with legal assistance?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, you were detained in the ICE facility or were you not?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yes. Well I was in county first and that was in downtown _____, like</br>   right on Fifth Avenue.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How long were you in County?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It was just a few days, like maybe a week, 10 days.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How did you feel there?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It was okay. I was in a different area where you really are like in</br>   a fish tank ‘cause it's all glass right here and the cops are right there</br>   on like an island and they're literally just looking down at you. So it was</br>   fine. I mean it was horrible ‘cause it was county, but yeah, they didn't do</br>   anything wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You didn't experience any abuse?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, no. They had us, really just watching us right there. So no, it</br>   was just the fact that nobody told me anything, they just kept on telling</br>   me to wait, that somebody would tell me what was happening. And that never</br>   happened.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, if you were detained, you were detained by ICE. How long did</br>   ICE detain you for?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh, I was there for like two months minimum.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you know where?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Tacoma, Washington.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How'd they treat you there?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh no, that was fine. Yeah, yeah. I think that was fine.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You ever have a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No. Well the thing is they are not ICE. They're a private company. A</br>   horrible part there was with ICE, whenever they actually get you to ICE.</br>   So, bad experiences, it was with ICE, not with the police and not with the</br>   other company. Yeah, it was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So then after they gave you your deportation notice, you get</br>   voluntary departure, what happened after?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Well after that, I just had to wait because they gave me a day two</br>   weeks in advance of when I was going to be leaving, the date and time of</br>   when I'd be going back. So I just had to wait for that time to go back</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, when you returned, were you were greeted by any Mexican</br>   authorities, or any government representative, non-government</br>   representatives?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It is government because when you walk through the door from the US</br>   to Mexico, you go into, I don't know exactly what it is, where they do the</br>   whatever to get your papers back up. So, you do have to line up and you</br>   give your information, they give you a temporary ID in case you want to get</br>   on a bus to go home or something, then you can use that.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did they give you money, food, shelter?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It was offered, I believe. Well at least shelter. I don't know about</br>   money. I think you do have the option. But because I had my family, I</br>   already had my ticket for the plane, and I had money on me. So we left</br>   right away.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, you've been back in Mexico eight years or nine?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, five.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Five years. And what city and town are you living in now?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Right now, I'm living in Ixtapaluca.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And that's in Mexico, the state of Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: State, yep.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: My mom.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Is it just your mom or do you have any brothers or sisters living</br>   with you?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, they're both in the States. Yeah, it's just me and her. We rent</br>   a house.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Has it been hard for you to return without your family members?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, yeah. ‘Cause my immediate family, they were the ones that I</br>   was closest to. Maybe because we were always outside of like Mexico City.</br>   ‘Cause even though me and my brother, we were born in Veracruz, but</br>   nobody's from over there, just my parents were there by that time. And so,</br>   we never really got to see my uncles, cousins, so I never got like really</br>   attached to them. It was always my family.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, was it hard for you to leave your family in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah it was. But also I was growing up. It was five years ago. Yeah,</br>   I mean, it was hard, but I also wanted to get jobs. I wanted to decide, say</br>   if I didn't like one job, I wanted to be able to say, “I don't like this</br>   job. I want to go over there.” I couldn't do that in the States, because I</br>   haven't got my papers.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that</br>   support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, honestly not.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Since you've been back have you pursued any studies?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, not that either. ‘Cause I think that it's iffy, like whenever</br>   you want to use your diploma from the States, they don't just say, “Okay</br>   you did that and so you can now go on to college or whatever.” I don't</br>   think it's like that. You have to do something.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Has that been hard for you with your culinary background?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I mean I wouldn't want to study that. I would actually want to study</br>   something that I can use here, like business or something, something where</br>   I can grow. But like I said, from what I've heard—I don't know too much—you</br>   do have to do something so that they can validate what you did in the</br>   States down here. But I don't know enough about it. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So that's too much for you, you don't want to go through that whole</br>   process?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I would, but I think it's also pricey. Like I said, I just don't</br>   know enough about it to do it. But I know that you need money.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How many jobs have you had since you've been back? Or what kind of</br>   jobs?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh, they've all been with call centers, really all of them. ‘Cause I</br>   know those are the ones that pay the most. That's that. I left for Puerto</br>   Vallarta for about six months. And my friend actually, well, he and a</br>   person from the States, opened a restaurant right there in downtown. And I</br>   was bartending there for like six months.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How'd you like that?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I mean I liked doing it, but the weather, it's not—I don't like hot</br>   weather at all. I'm from Seattle. I can't do hot weather. Too hot like</br>   that, muggy and steamy? No, no, I didn't like that.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, do you feel like your time in the US has shaped the things that</br>   you want here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh yeah. Yeah. [Laughs]. ‘Cause you compare everything like that</br>   with everything. Like with everything! You're just like, “Well it wasn't</br>   like that in the States. They should do it like that here.” But yeah,</br>   that's always like, “Ah, that should be like that, not like this.”</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You said, “I'm from ____, I'm not used to this weather.” Do you</br>   feel like you're from the United States now?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It's what I know. ‘Cause right here in Mexico, before I left, I was</br>   in secundaria, but the secundaria that I was in was in the same complex</br>   where we used to live. It was a gated community type of thing, like a tiny</br>   one. But the school was inside of there, so I had to walk like two minutes</br>   to get to school. So I wasn't at an age really where I was going places or</br>   getting a job, nothing. I was just house, church, school back then. So in</br>   the States is where I really got out and did things.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You didn't do that here?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh yeah now I do. But I don't know the city that well. I mean I've</br>   been here for five years, but it still feels gigantic. Which I like, but I</br>   still don't know it well.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have to get used to new friends?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh yeah. [Laughs]. No, yeah, it took me—actually I met my best</br>   friends right here in TeleTech. So they are the ones that are like my</br>   second family really.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How much were you paid for your most current job?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: The one that I'm at right now, we get 55 an hour.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's pesos?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yes. I wish it was dollars, but yeah, pesos.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: [Chuckles]. I mean, depends where I am. I was going to say, “If I'm</br>   at work, yeah,” but just a couple of days ago, I was walking from here to</br>   the subway and somebody got killed over there. There was a pool of blood</br>   right there with the police tape around it. So, I mean, right here in</br>   Mexico City, I think you always kind of have to be on your toes, regardless</br>   of where you are.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Have you ever been the victim of a violent crime here?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, not here, no.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel more vulnerable as a return migrant?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I don't know that that plays a role. I think we're all like, exposed</br>   to the same type of not being safe, whatever.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="8f30ecea-ec97-446a-85fc-b94cce2136ef" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Employment">Sergio: Was your return to Mexico difficult?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Yeah. Because I wasn't used to it. But yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, what was the hardest thing about it? What were some of the<br>
   challenges you had?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Like I said, I didn't know the city at all to begin with. I didn't<br>
   know anyone down here that could even like tell me how to get a job ‘cause<br>
   I've never had to get a job with papers. You know, the right way. I never<br>
   did that. Yeah, so that would have been helpful.<br>

Well, I mean on the news page, that's what I read</br>   everything.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How about any newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you think you'll return to the US someday?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Not unless there was a way for me to get the papers. I will never go</br>   back without papers.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: If you do return, why would you return?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: To see my family and my friends. Yeah. That would be the number one</br>   reason.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you currently volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No. Here in Mexico, I've never volunteered.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What parts of your experience do you think could have been improved</br>   coming back?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="5ec032c5-8b47-4258-9caf-45c32ade2343" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Ice, Mistreatment by, Detention, Racism">Josue: Coming back? Like of the entire process? I mean, being with ICE was<br>
   horrible. And it's horrible because... So the people that have you<br>
   detained, like in Tacoma, they're all American. And they never really<br>
   mistreated us, not really. But whenever they turned us over in San Diego<br>
   with ICE, they all got their last names right here, and every single one of<br>
   them was Latino. You know, ‘cause they got their last names right there.<br>
   They were the ones, you know, that had us up against the bus with our hands<br>
   up with the guns pulled out.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: There’s a lot of them. So yeah, they're the ones that were screaming<br>
   at us. They never spoke Spanish, it was always English. I remember one of<br>
   the guys, ‘cause they had us walk in from the airplane to the bus with our<br>
   hands up, and I think somebody put them down—I mean we're still shackled<br>
   up, you know, everything. And they put them down and they all like started<br>
   screaming at him, pointing the gun on him too. So that to me was like the<br>
   worst of the entire thing. Just having somebody that, you know, they're all<br>
   Latinos, treat you that way. I think that was the worst. And I don't know.<br>
   Maybe the other part is the place that you go into after, right when you<br>
   cross the border, they don't really give you any information.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: No, not that either. ‘Cause I think that it's iffy, like whenever<br>
   you want to use your diploma from the States, they don't just say, “Okay<br>
   you did that and so you can now go on to college or whatever.” I don't<br>
   think it's like that. You have to do something.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Has that been hard for you with your culinary background?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: I mean I wouldn't want to study that. I would actually want to study<br>
   something that I can use here, like business or something, something where<br>
   I can grow. But like I said, from what I've heard—I don't know too much—you<br>
   do have to do something so that they can validate what you did in the<br>
   States down here. But I don't know enough about it. That's it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So that's too much for you, you don't want to go through that whole<br>
   process?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: I would, but I think it's also pricey. Like I said, I just don't<br>
   know enough about it to do it. But I know that you need money.<br>
 <br>

   I mean, it was hard, but I also wanted to get jobs. I wanted to decide, say<br>
   if I didn't like one job, I wanted to be able to say, “I don't like this<br>
   job. I want to go over there.” I couldn't do that in the States, because I<br>
   haven't got my papers.<br>

   was closest to. Maybe because we were always outside of like Mexico City.<br>
   ‘Cause even though me and my brother, we were born in Veracruz, but<br>
   nobody's from over there, just my parents were there by that time. And so,<br>
   we never really got to see my uncles, cousins, so I never got like really<br>
   attached to them. It was always my family.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Yes. Well I was in county first and that was in downtown _____, like<br>
   right on Fifth Avenue.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: How long were you in County?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: It was just a few days, like maybe a week, 10 days.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: How did you feel there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: It was okay. I was in a different area where you really are like in<br>
   a fish tank ‘cause it's all glass right here and the cops are right there<br>
   on like an island and they're literally just looking down at you. So it was<br>
   fine. I mean it was horrible ‘cause it was county, but yeah, they didn't do<br>
   anything wrong.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You didn't experience any abuse?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: No, no. They had us, really just watching us right there. So no, it<br>
   was just the fact that nobody told me anything, they just kept on telling<br>
   me to wait, that somebody would tell me what was happening. And that never<br>
   happened.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, if you were detained, you were detained by ICE. How long did<br>
   ICE detain you for?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Oh, I was there for like two months minimum.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Do you know where?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Tacoma, Washington.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: How'd they treat you there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Oh no, that was fine. Yeah, yeah. I think that was fine.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You ever have a bad experience?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: No. Well the thing is they are not ICE. They're a private company. A<br>
   horrible part there was with ICE, whenever they actually get you to ICE.<br>
   So, bad experiences, it was with ICE, not with the police and not with the<br>
   other company. Yeah, it was with them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

   car, and I went to a friend’s in downtown Seattle. Left the car parked in a<br>
   parking lot, and then I went to my friend's house, or whatever. I was<br>
   coming back and I didn't have my driver's license with me—I forgot it that<br>
   day. And so, somebody I guess called the cops saying that maybe I looked<br>
   suspicious or something because the cops came, they got me, I didn't have<br>
   my ID, the car wasn't under my name. And so they said that they were<br>
   charging me with car prowling, which at the end they dropped everything<br>
   because that was not the case. And yeah, that's what happened. They took me<br>
   in.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, the police detained you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Yeah, it was the cops. And so, they got me and then I spent a few<br>
   days in County. Ain't nobody told me anything. Like I would ask, like “Why<br>
   am I exactly here? Can I speak with somebody?” And they kept on telling me,<br>
   like “Oh, you're going to get your hearing,” whatever. But I never did. A<br>
   few days after that, ICE came and you know they start asking like, “When<br>
   did you come in? What's your social security number?” All those questions.<br>
   And then they left. A couple of days after that, they came back, but you<br>
   know already with the shackles and everything for a bunch of people. And<br>
   that's how they took us down to the detention center in Tacoma.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: What year was this, that that happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: 13? 2013.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, you never actually went before a judge for this case that the<br>
   cop stopped you for?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Never. I had a persecutor right there when I had my hearing in ICE,<br>
   with a judge, cause I told her, she asked me, “Do you want to fight the<br>
   case? You want to do something?” I said, “No.” And I told her I just want<br>
   to sign the voluntary departure. As soon as I said that, the guy to the<br>
   left, he was like, “No, like he has charges.” They wanted to deport me,<br>
   which wouldn't have made a difference really for me ‘cause I'm not going<br>
   back. But he said, like “He's got this, charges,” whatever. I don't know<br>
   how they can call them charges when they never really charged me with<br>
   anything ‘cause I never had a hearing on it. And so then I explained<br>
   exactly what I said to you. I told the judge, she turned and looked at him<br>
   and the guy said, “Okay, we're deferring the charges.” That's just what he<br>
   said. And she said, okay, she signed it. That's it. [Chuckles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: That's wild.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: It was.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, they just looked at you and they were like, “Okay, we're<br>
   dropping everything?”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The persecutor just said, he used that term,<br>
   “We're not dropping the charges, we're deferring the charges,” something<br>
   like that. She said, “Okay,” signed it. And that's how I got the voluntary<br>
   one.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, were you informed of your rights during this process?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: No, I would say no. No because whenever I explained it to the judge,<br>
   I told her like, “Whenever I was in county, nobody ever told me anything. I<br>
   didn't know anything of whether we're charging me with. Whenever ICE came,<br>
   same thing. They just took me and didn't say anything.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Did you have a lawyer helping you through it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: No, no. ‘Cause like I said, I didn't want to fight anything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So you weren’t provided with legal assistance?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: No.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: I don't know. I think that I could have because I did all of my high<br>
   school there and college as well. But I never really looked into it. And<br>
   what's funny is before I actually came to Mexico, about a year before, I<br>
   called my mom and I told her that I wanted to come back. So like nine<br>
   months after that, that's when I got caught. So first I had bail, and then<br>
   whenever I had my meeting with a judge, like my hearing, she asked<br>
   me—'cause I was like the only one in the room that they didn't need a<br>
   translator—she was like, “Are you sure you don't want to fight your case?”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: But there were so many people there that I knew, maybe they were in<br>
   my situation where they could have qualified, but they had been there for<br>
   years, or you know like a year or something. I didn't think it was worth<br>
   it. So I signed my voluntary departure.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: A little bit. But the stories that I heard, they didn't really feel<br>
   like they were hitting too close to home until I started hearing about the<br>
   warehouse for the newspaper. They did a raid over there. And that's the<br>
   first summer I was like, “I don't know.” But we kept on going and I didn't<br>
   experience a raid like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, the warehouse got raided?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: And you weren't working there anymore?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: No. The thing is that we all worked there: me, my mom, my brother.<br>
   Me, at one point, I was working with my mom on one route and my dad was<br>
   doing another one. At some point, we all had one, and it had to be at the<br>
   point when only my dad was working there ‘cause I remember he was the one<br>
   to tell me about that. And so, I know that for some time, he would be the<br>
   one to go and bring the newspapers to us. And you know, just take them up.<br>

   the time, for about five years. And then she came back here ‘cause she<br>
   didn't like working over there. You know the jobs that you get over there.<br>
   Like I said, I didn't feel like we were in a bad position where we needed<br>
   to go through everything that we went through. So my mom came back.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, what happened to the family after she left?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Oh, my parents split. Well, I think they were already splitting, and<br>
   you know, whenever she said, “I'm going back with my little sister.” Yeah,<br>
   that was like, “Okay, yeah, they're splitting.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: They're splitting?<br>

   Josue: Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: And how did that impact you growing up there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Josue: Honestly, not really. Because when she came back, I kind of already<br>
   knew that it was going to happen, and I wasn't that young to already not<br>
   really understand what was happening. So, my mom told me she wasn't happy<br>
   over there and I wanted her to be happy, you know?<br>

   Navy shirt with an American flag right here. And there was a guy in my PE<br>
   class, which were the classes that were not ESL, so it was mostly white<br>
   people. And so, I remember him saying something to the effect of, “How were<br>
   you even wearing that when you can't even speak the language?”<br>
 <br>

Did they never ask for your papers?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, my dad is still working in the newspaper ‘cause it's okay money</br>   and it's just a few hours. So, he's still working there so I don't think</br>   they really check papers there—you know, social security and stuff. And</br>   with the other one, with _____, they actually had a manager there when I</br>   first got in. It was actually my dad that was going to get the job, but we</br>   started talking with the manager and he was Latino—I don't know what he</br>   was. But I think he kind of knew what the situation was until years later.</br>   Me and my dad actually worked there at some point, both of us.

So, my mom told me she wasn't happy</br>   over there and I wanted her to be happy, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, when you were living in the US you were living with your</br>   parents, your siblings, any other relatives or anything like that?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, it was just us.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Were you ever worried about getting caught by US authorities?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: A little bit. But the stories that I heard, they didn't really feel</br>   like they were hitting too close to home until I started hearing about the</br>   warehouse for the newspaper. They did a raid over there. And that's the</br>   first summer I was like, “I don't know.” But we kept on going and I didn't</br>   experience a raid like that.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, the warehouse got raided?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And you weren't working there anymore?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No. The thing is that we all worked there: me, my mom, my brother.</br>   Me, at one point, I was working with my mom on one route and my dad was</br>   doing another one. At some point, we all had one, and it had to be at the</br>   point when only my dad was working there ‘cause I remember he was the one</br>   to tell me about that. And so, I know that for some time, he would be the</br>   one to go and bring the newspapers to us. And you know, just take them up.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah. So your dad didn't get caught in that raid?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, no, no, no. I know that he knew about it, but I don't think he</br>   was there at that moment.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Well that's good. Did you ever send money to your relatives in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No. No, I'm not that close.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How long did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: 11 years?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: 11 years. Did you follow US political news while you were living in</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: News? Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And how'd you follow it?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Newspaper. We always had leftover. Newspaper every day. [Laughing].</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Seattle Times?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's funny. Any other way that you followed the news?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Well, I mean more so more recently, through the phone. But back</br>   then, it was with a newspaper.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Just newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, while you were in the United States, did you follow Mexican</br>   political news?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you qualify for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I don't know. I think that I could have because I did all of my high</br>   school there and college as well. But I never really looked into it. And</br>   what's funny is before I actually came to Mexico, about a year before, I</br>   called my mom and I told her that I wanted to come back. So like nine</br>   months after that, that's when I got caught. So first I had bail, and then</br>   whenever I had my meeting with a judge, like my hearing, she asked</br>   me—'cause I was like the only one in the room that they didn't need a</br>   translator—she was like, “Are you sure you don't want to fight your case?”</br> </br> </br>   Josue: But there were so many people there that I knew, maybe they were in</br>   my situation where they could have qualified, but they had been there for</br>   years, or you know like a year or something. I didn't think it was worth</br>   it. So I signed my voluntary departure.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, on this topic of getting caught, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh, it was really stupid [Chuckle] Because I was driving my dad's</br>   car, and I went to a friend’s in downtown Seattle. Left the car parked in a</br>   parking lot, and then I went to my friend's house, or whatever. I was</br>   coming back and I didn't have my driver's license with me—I forgot it that</br>   day. And so, somebody I guess called the cops saying that maybe I looked</br>   suspicious or something because the cops came, they got me, I didn't have</br>   my ID, the car wasn't under my name. And so they said that they were</br>   charging me with car prowling, which at the end they dropped everything</br>   because that was not the case. And yeah, that's what happened. They took me</br>   in.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, the police detained you?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, it was the cops. And so, they got me and then I spent a few</br>   days in County. Ain't nobody told me anything. Like I would ask, like “Why</br>   am I exactly here? Can I speak with somebody?” And they kept on telling me,</br>   like “Oh, you're going to get your hearing,” whatever. But I never did. A</br>   few days after that, ICE came and you know they start asking like, “When</br>   did you come in? What's your social security number?” All those questions.</br>   And then they left. A couple of days after that, they came back, but you</br>   know already with the shackles and everything for a bunch of people. And</br>   that's how they took us down to the detention center in Tacoma.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What year was this, that that happened?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: 13? 2013.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, you never actually went before a judge for this case that the</br>   cop stopped you for?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Never. I had a persecutor right there when I had my hearing in ICE,</br>   with a judge, cause I told her, she asked me, “Do you want to fight the</br>   case? You want to do something?” I said, “No.” And I told her I just want</br>   to sign the voluntary departure. As soon as I said that, the guy to the</br>   left, he was like, “No, like he has charges.” They wanted to deport me,</br>   which wouldn't have made a difference really for me ‘cause I'm not going</br>   back. But he said, like “He's got this, charges,” whatever. I don't know</br>   how they can call them charges when they never really charged me with</br>   anything ‘cause I never had a hearing on it. And so then I explained</br>   exactly what I said to you. I told the judge, she turned and looked at him</br>   and the guy said, “Okay, we're deferring the charges.” That's just what he</br>   said. And she said, okay, she signed it. That's it. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's wild.</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It was.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, they just looked at you and they were like, “Okay, we're</br>   dropping everything?”</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The persecutor just said, he used that term,</br>   “We're not dropping the charges, we're deferring the charges,” something</br>   like that. She said, “Okay,” signed it. And that's how I got the voluntary</br>   one.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, were you informed of your rights during this process?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, I would say no. No because whenever I explained it to the judge,</br>   I told her like, “Whenever I was in county, nobody ever told me anything. I</br>   didn't know anything of whether we're charging me with. Whenever ICE came,</br>   same thing. They just took me and didn't say anything.”</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have a lawyer helping you through it?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, no. ‘Cause like I said, I didn't want to fight anything.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you weren’t provided with legal assistance?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, you were detained in the ICE facility or were you not?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yes. Well I was in county first and that was in downtown _____, like</br>   right on Fifth Avenue.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How long were you in County?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It was just a few days, like maybe a week, 10 days.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How did you feel there?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It was okay. I was in a different area where you really are like in</br>   a fish tank ‘cause it's all glass right here and the cops are right there</br>   on like an island and they're literally just looking down at you. So it was</br>   fine. I mean it was horrible ‘cause it was county, but yeah, they didn't do</br>   anything wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You didn't experience any abuse?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, no. They had us, really just watching us right there. So no, it</br>   was just the fact that nobody told me anything, they just kept on telling</br>   me to wait, that somebody would tell me what was happening. And that never</br>   happened.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, if you were detained, you were detained by ICE. How long did</br>   ICE detain you for?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh, I was there for like two months minimum.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you know where?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Tacoma, Washington.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How'd they treat you there?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh no, that was fine. Yeah, yeah. I think that was fine.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You ever have a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No. Well the thing is they are not ICE. They're a private company. A</br>   horrible part there was with ICE, whenever they actually get you to ICE.</br>   So, bad experiences, it was with ICE, not with the police and not with the</br>   other company. Yeah, it was with them.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So then after they gave you your deportation notice, you get</br>   voluntary departure, what happened after?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Well after that, I just had to wait because they gave me a day two</br>   weeks in advance of when I was going to be leaving, the date and time of</br>   when I'd be going back. So I just had to wait for that time to go back</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, when you returned, were you were greeted by any Mexican</br>   authorities, or any government representative, non-government</br>   representatives?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It is government because when you walk through the door from the US</br>   to Mexico, you go into, I don't know exactly what it is, where they do the</br>   whatever to get your papers back up. So, you do have to line up and you</br>   give your information, they give you a temporary ID in case you want to get</br>   on a bus to go home or something, then you can use that.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did they give you money, food, shelter?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It was offered, I believe. Well at least shelter. I don't know about</br>   money. I think you do have the option. But because I had my family, I</br>   already had my ticket for the plane, and I had money on me. So we left</br>   right away.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, you've been back in Mexico eight years or nine?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, five.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Five years. And what city and town are you living in now?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Right now, I'm living in Ixtapaluca.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And that's in Mexico, the state of Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: State, yep.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: My mom.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Is it just your mom or do you have any brothers or sisters living</br>   with you?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, they're both in the States. Yeah, it's just me and her. We rent</br>   a house.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Has it been hard for you to return without your family members?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, yeah. ‘Cause my immediate family, they were the ones that I</br>   was closest to. Maybe because we were always outside of like Mexico City.</br>   ‘Cause even though me and my brother, we were born in Veracruz, but</br>   nobody's from over there, just my parents were there by that time. And so,</br>   we never really got to see my uncles, cousins, so I never got like really</br>   attached to them. It was always my family.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, was it hard for you to leave your family in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah it was. But also I was growing up. It was five years ago. Yeah,</br>   I mean, it was hard, but I also wanted to get jobs. I wanted to decide, say</br>   if I didn't like one job, I wanted to be able to say, “I don't like this</br>   job. I want to go over there.” I couldn't do that in the States, because I</br>   haven't got my papers.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that</br>   support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, honestly not.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Since you've been back have you pursued any studies?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, not that either. ‘Cause I think that it's iffy, like whenever</br>   you want to use your diploma from the States, they don't just say, “Okay</br>   you did that and so you can now go on to college or whatever.” I don't</br>   think it's like that. You have to do something.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Has that been hard for you with your culinary background?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I mean I wouldn't want to study that. I would actually want to study</br>   something that I can use here, like business or something, something where</br>   I can grow. But like I said, from what I've heard—I don't know too much—you</br>   do have to do something so that they can validate what you did in the</br>   States down here. But I don't know enough about it. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So that's too much for you, you don't want to go through that whole</br>   process?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I would, but I think it's also pricey. Like I said, I just don't</br>   know enough about it to do it. But I know that you need money.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How many jobs have you had since you've been back? Or what kind of</br>   jobs?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh, they've all been with call centers, really all of them. ‘Cause I</br>   know those are the ones that pay the most. That's that. I left for Puerto</br>   Vallarta for about six months. And my friend actually, well, he and a</br>   person from the States, opened a restaurant right there in downtown. And I</br>   was bartending there for like six months.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How'd you like that?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I mean I liked doing it, but the weather, it's not—I don't like hot</br>   weather at all. I'm from Seattle. I can't do hot weather. Too hot like</br>   that, muggy and steamy? No, no, I didn't like that.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, do you feel like your time in the US has shaped the things that</br>   you want here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh yeah. Yeah. [Laughs]. ‘Cause you compare everything like that</br>   with everything. Like with everything! You're just like, “Well it wasn't</br>   like that in the States. They should do it like that here.” But yeah,</br>   that's always like, “Ah, that should be like that, not like this.”</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You said, “I'm from ____, I'm not used to this weather.” Do you</br>   feel like you're from the United States now?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: It's what I know. ‘Cause right here in Mexico, before I left, I was</br>   in secundaria, but the secundaria that I was in was in the same complex</br>   where we used to live. It was a gated community type of thing, like a tiny</br>   one. But the school was inside of there, so I had to walk like two minutes</br>   to get to school. So I wasn't at an age really where I was going places or</br>   getting a job, nothing. I was just house, church, school back then. So in</br>   the States is where I really got out and did things.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You didn't do that here?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh yeah now I do. But I don't know the city that well. I mean I've</br>   been here for five years, but it still feels gigantic. Which I like, but I</br>   still don't know it well.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have to get used to new friends?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Oh yeah. [Laughs]. No, yeah, it took me—actually I met my best</br>   friends right here in TeleTech. So they are the ones that are like my</br>   second family really.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How much were you paid for your most current job?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: The one that I'm at right now, we get 55 an hour.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That's pesos?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yes. I wish it was dollars, but yeah, pesos.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: [Chuckles]. I mean, depends where I am. I was going to say, “If I'm</br>   at work, yeah,” but just a couple of days ago, I was walking from here to</br>   the subway and somebody got killed over there. There was a pool of blood</br>   right there with the police tape around it. So, I mean, right here in</br>   Mexico City, I think you always kind of have to be on your toes, regardless</br>   of where you are.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Have you ever been the victim of a violent crime here?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, not here, no.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel more vulnerable as a return migrant?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: I don't know that that plays a role. I think we're all like, exposed</br>   to the same type of not being safe, whatever.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah. Because I wasn't used to it. But yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, what was the hardest thing about it? What were some of the</br>   challenges you had?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Like I said, I didn't know the city at all to begin with. I didn't</br>   know anyone down here that could even like tell me how to get a job ‘cause</br>   I've never had to get a job with papers. You know, the right way. I never</br>   did that. Yeah, so that would have been helpful.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Not just a job, but like how to do it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah, I do.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How do you follow it?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Internet, Google News icon every day.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Google?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What other?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No, that's it. Well, I mean on the news page, that's what I read</br>   everything.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How about any newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you think you'll return to the US someday?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Not unless there was a way for me to get the papers. I will never go</br>   back without papers.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: If you do return, why would you return?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: To see my family and my friends. Yeah. That would be the number one</br>   reason.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you currently volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: No. Here in Mexico, I've never volunteered.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What parts of your experience do you think could have been improved</br>   coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Coming back? Like of the entire process? I mean, being with ICE was</br>   horrible. And it's horrible because... So the people that have you</br>   detained, like in Tacoma, they're all American. And they never really</br>   mistreated us, not really. But whenever they turned us over in San Diego</br>   with ICE, they all got their last names right here, and every single one of</br>   them was Latino. You know, ‘cause they got their last names right there.</br>   They were the ones, you know, that had us up against the bus with our hands</br>   up with the guns pulled out.</br> </br> </br>   Josue: There’s a lot of them. So yeah, they're the ones that were screaming</br>   at us. They never spoke Spanish, it was always English. I remember one of</br>   the guys, ‘cause they had us walk in from the airplane to the bus with our</br>   hands up, and I think somebody put them down—I mean we're still shackled</br>   up, you know, everything. And they put them down and they all like started</br>   screaming at him, pointing the gun on him too. So that to me was like the</br>   worst of the entire thing. Just having somebody that, you know, they're all</br>   Latinos, treat you that way. I think that was the worst. And I don't know.</br>   Maybe the other part is the place that you go into after, right when you</br>   cross the border, they don't really give you any information.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Is there anything else that you think would be important to say, or</br>   like on your mind about your whole experience that you want to kind of talk</br>   about?</br> </br> </br>   Josue: Well like I said, I just wish there was better support for people</br>   coming back. There's too many people that are coming back from the States</br>   who don't really know how it works in general. Like I have no idea about</br>   many things of how it works here in Mexico, and I don’t know who to go to</br>   that would really understand why we don't know the things that we don't</br>   know. I don't know. I think that would be helpful.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay. Thank you.</br> </div><\p>
