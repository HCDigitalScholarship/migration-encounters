How did you cross the border? Did you have a visa or did you</br>   just cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Both my parents had work permits and they paid a coyote to cross</br>   me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I crossed through with a car in the desert. Well they had a contact</br>   that they had a kid that was around my age and they made me go through as a</br>   boy. And so—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Really?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes. As someone else's child. I got dressed up as a boy so I could</br>   cross the border with this other person, and my parents told me that I was</br>   supposed to be in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">San Antonio</span> at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">seven at night</span> because that's what the</br>   coyote told my parents, and they didn't find me until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">four in the morning</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh my God.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yeah, so my parents thought I was already sold to the organ trade</br>   or something. My mom was scared and then she found the coyote but they had</br>   issues crossing and everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: It was a pretty scary experience?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: It was pretty [Affirmative sound]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Before they dressed you like a boy, did you have long hair?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes I did [Affirmative sound], but they cut it all off so I could</br>   cross with them [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two</span>. I don't remember anything. They made me go as someone</br>   else's child [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did your parents tell you what happened? How did you get lost? Do</br>   they know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: They said that the coyote told them that he was going to call them</br>   at seven as soon as they got there, but they never called them and they</br>   didn't know where to look because they had no other contact with him</br>   whatsoever. Until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">later on that night</span>, they said that they got a call from</br>   him at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">four in the morning</span> and my mom was already scared, but they couldn't</br>   go to any authority because it was something illegal to do. So they just</br>   picked me up and they just paid him off and then it was over.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you become a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> resident?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No, my grandfather was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen, but we never got anything from</br>   him because it was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time my dad had ever met him and he didn't</br>   want to receive any of his help because he would charge him later on.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Because he would what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: He would like…if he received anything from his dad, he would later</br>   on tell him that everything he had is because of him. He’d be in debt</br>   forever.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So it wasn't a great reunion?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: [Negative sound] no, my dad had never met him in all his life. He</br>   was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">19</span> when he left.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: It was horrible because my grandfather had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> restaurants and</br>   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad. In</br>   Arkansas at that time it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">seven dollars</span> an hour and he would give my dad</br>   three dollars an hour [Pause] in his restaurant, and my dad figured out</br>   that he would only employ illegals, and especially <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Native Americans</span> that</br>   didn't speak Spanish—that they spoke dialects so they wouldn't understand</br>   what was going on—and since they didn't know anything because it was a new</br>   country to them, he could exploit them and never report taxes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Your grandfather who was originally from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>…</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes, and he came before <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">1983</span>, which was the amnesty. Yeah, and he</br>   got his citizenship from that. His whole family got it, and then he went to</br>   look for my dad when he was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eighteen</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nineteen</span> and he told him, &quot;Come</br>   with me so you can work and we can actually be a family,&quot; because my dad</br>   had never seen him his whole life and my dad wanted a relationship with him</br>   he said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and he said, &quot;Maybe I can have a better job over there and</br>   stuff,&quot; and my grandfather was like, &quot;Come and I'll support you.&quot; So my dad</br>   came and then later on, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the next six months</span> passed and he brought my mom</br>   and then <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">another year</span> passed and then he brought me [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: we hear about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> exploiting—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: [Affirmative sound] and now it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanics</span> exploiting <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanics</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: [Pause]You didn't speak any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> when you went?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But you learned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How did you learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Nobody really taught me. I would just go to school and listen to</br>   everybody's voices—I just went into school knowing just basic <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, like</br>   &quot;Can I go to the restroom?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; or &quot;I don't understand.&quot;</br>   Those were the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of</br>   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How would you describe your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> skills now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Fluent.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: In what cities did you live in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: ____ <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Arkansas</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You went to school.

No?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No. I have no siblings.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Were you frightened of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> authorities?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did your family send money to relatives in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How many times a year, more or less?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Every month, so <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">twelve</span> times a year.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you know about how much, guessing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Maybe <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">a thousand</span> a month.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How long did you live in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Sixteen years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Sixteen years</span>. So, let's stop for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a second</span>. You said you were afraid</br>   of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew</br>   that I was undocumented until I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eight</span>, and my parents told me that I</br>   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. They</br>   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because</br>   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had</br>   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities</br>   might come and get my parents.</br> </br> </br>   They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here</br>   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I</br>   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's</br>   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for</br>   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off</br>   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen</br>   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from</br>   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same</br>   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, &quot;Why can't you go</br>   to the hospital?&quot; Or, &quot;Why can't you apply for certain things, government</br>   things?&quot; And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was</br>   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the</br>   authorities ... If anything happened to any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> or me or my family,</br>   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we</br>   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like</br>   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What was it like to live having to keep such a secret?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: [Pause] I'd be frightened and I mean—I just didn't like that life.</br>   I guess that's why I chose to come back here. But sometimes I question if</br>   coming back here was the best choice or not.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: let’s pause the survey and talk—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I guess it’s because ... it's not home and people have a different</br>   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many</br>   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew</br>   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the</br>   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more</br>   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church</br>   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. So, you said “back home.” “Back home” for you is the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You consider the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> your home?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes, I consider it home.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What does home mean to you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means</br>   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's</br>   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel</br>   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my</br>   whole life.</br> </br> </br>   But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">seventy-five   </span>percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span></br>   or always the question would be, &quot;Are you legal or are you illegal?&quot; And I</br>   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society</br>   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, &quot;What's home?&quot;</br>   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I</br>   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Arkansas</span> because I</br>   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back</br>   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> news when you were in the</br>   states?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,</br>   radio, newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped</br>   immigrants. I was there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four years</span> and I helped kids apply for DACA</br>   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because</br>   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go</br>   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, “What if it all</br>   falls down and we're the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> ones to get deported?”</br> </br> </br>   So, my parents would be scared and they also…we saw the limitations. You</br>   would have to pay <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> times the tuition and you couldn't really get a lot</br>   of scholarships. So, there was no way for me to go to college if I would</br>   have to pay so much—even more than what my parents would receive in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span>,</br>   because my parents would receive like $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">20,000</span> or less a year.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So even if you had gotten—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: DACA, it wouldn't really work for me because I could only work with</br>   that and I couldn't study. And what I wanted to do was study and actually</br>   be able to travel and visit new places and have more opportunities and not</br>   just be stuck in one place.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What would you have studied?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Political science and international relations.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that</br>   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me</br>   it's better if you go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> before you’re <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eighteen</span>—I mean after you're</br>   eighteen or before. After you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eighteen</span>, you had to wait <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">180 days</span>—I mean</br>   you have to not exceed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">180 days</span>—so you can be able to apply and not have</br>   that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten-year</span> sentence of not being able to apply for a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> visa.</br> </br> </br>   My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to</br>   Mexico and go to a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> university and we'll support you from here, from</br>   the States.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I came alone. I came <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month ago</span>. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I</br>   want to stay here [in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the</br>   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,</br>   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because</br>   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to</br>   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --</br>   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I applied to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> universities, but they told me I would have to restart</br>   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to</br>   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't</br>   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I</br>   applied to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Australia</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New Zealand</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>, and I got in all <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> of</br>   them in various universities. And I chose <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span> since <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Australia</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New   Zealand</span> are way too far away from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>—it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">like thirty-six hours</span>.</br> </br> </br>   And I said well it's better if I go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span> since it will be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">five hours</span></br>   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span></br>   universities in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span> and I got scholarships from them.</br> </br> </br>   I chose one in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Vancouver</span>—<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Douglas College</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, and I got a full</br>   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three weeks ago</span>. So,</br>   I came here [from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>] <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month and a week ago</span>—to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>. The</br>   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   The next week I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Vancouver</span> to visit my school, and I also found out</br>   that in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Vancouver</span> if you study <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four years</span> in a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Canadian</span> university, you can</br>   get your citizenship in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the sixth year</span>. And I thought that was a great</br>   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant</br>   friendly since all of them were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Asian</span>. Well, there's a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Asian</span></br>   influence -- <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Asian</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Muslim</span>, all types of cultures, a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanics</span>, and</br>   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.</br> </br> </br>   I just felt more at home there than even <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, because here I still get</br>   discriminated against for not speaking my language well. And I get</br>   discriminated against because they're like, &quot;Well, you're still <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span>.</br>   You're not anything more. You're not special or you're not more than us</br>   just because you lived in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you're going to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Douglas --</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Douglas College</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Which is in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Vancouver</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Vancouver</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Where else did you apply?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">York University</span> and Winnipeg University and I also applied to the</br>   University of Ottawa, where I also got in. But since <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Douglas University</span></br>   gave me a full scholarship for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span>, I said I'll choose that one, and</br>   those [the other colleges] were partial scholarships.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I really loved <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">York</span>, but my mom said, &quot;Well just go wherever the</br>   money is at, where the full scholarship is at.&quot; And I went and I loved it.</br>   I really loved it and it felt more like…well not like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Arkansas</span>, but similar</br>   to the culture back in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, so I liked that. I just don't feel</br>   identified in either place.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. So, wait a minute, we have a lot to fill in [survey</br>   questions]. You followed the news, you said through TV and newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Which newspapers do you read?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> ones like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">La Opinión</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Latino Times</span>, [Pause] Since my</br>   coalition would partner up with them and give them all the information,</br>   because my coalition would go talk to senators, the governor, and everyone</br>   else, and we also went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New Orleans</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Arizona</span> to fight for people's</br>   rights, and even to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Washington DC</span>.</br> </br> </br>   I would volunteer more than …in the summer, I would do more than over two</br>   hundred hours. I would work full time there without pay. I just really</br>   loved that work because I knew the struggle and I knew that almost all the</br>   kids in my school who were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latino</span> and were about to graduate could not have</br>   the opportunity to go to college.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you basically think that DACA or the DREAMers don't work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes. Yes. I think you really don't get an advantage from it because</br>   you might be able to work, have a driver's license, have an ID, but they'll</br>   overcharge you for college. An immigrant will never be able to get the</br>   amount of money [for college that they need], especially if they're</br>   illegal.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you follow <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> news?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I never followed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> news.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So [reading the survey questions] you qualified for DACA but you</br>   didn't apply?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Because?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: It was risky.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: and you made the decision to leave?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I remember leaving and my dad calling me when I was in the waiting</br>   room for the flight. He said, &quot;You know what? Just turn around and come</br>   back. We'll fix it. We'll find something. [Starts crying] we'll find you a</br>   job and we might be able to pay for college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   But I said, &quot;No. I have to go.&quot; [Cries] I’m sorry. So I left and I came</br>   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.</br>   She's like, &quot;Do you see me?&quot; But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not</br>   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, &quot;Where are</br>   you? I can't find you,&quot; and she said, &quot;I don't see you either.&quot; She was</br>   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, &quot;Oh.&quot; And she's like,</br>   &quot;I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.”</br> </br> </br>   I met her and it's just ... I didn't really feel a connection there because</br>   I never really talked to her. I don't think I ever spoke to her once in my</br>   life. I know I spoke to my mom's parents and her grandparents because they</br>   came to visit us, but it wasn't ... they would visit and stay for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a week</span> or</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>, but I really never felt anything because it'd be like, oh, they're</br>   your grandparents, but you never had much time to spend with them or have</br>   experiences with them, if it's such a limited time they're with you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: [Affirmative sound]. Are you living with that grandmother now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And ... I'm just going to go through this [the survey] okay? So how</br>   long have you been back, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I do live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You live with your grandparents, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: [Affirmative sound]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you become aware of programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes, like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">New Comienzos</span>. My mom always told me before I would come,</br>   &quot;You should be a part of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">New Comienzos</span>. I found out about it on the</br>   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think</br>   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and</br>   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is</br>   UNAM [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México</span>]. And they told me that I</br>   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   history—not even the National Anthem.</br> </br> </br>   And I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll study again, one or two years of high school</br>   since I don't have certain classes that they require, and I have to take</br>   their admission test as well.” I [told myself], &quot; I feel like that would</br>   have been a waste of my time when everybody my age is already starting to</br>   go to college.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, I might be able to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   My aunt [also] told me, &quot;If you want a job you can work with me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I soon realized that jobs here aren't like jobs back home. Jobs here are</br>   very… they pay you very little. They pay you what my mom or my dad would</br>   get in like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two days</span>. I would get <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">6,500 pesos</span> for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a whole month</span>, and I</br>   would start at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">eight in the morning</span>. I only worked there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five days</span>, or</br>   I'll just say <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a week</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: This was in a call center?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: In a call center -- from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">seven in the morning</span> to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">six in the   </span>afternoon.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">Six thousand pesos</span> per what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">6,500 pesos</span> per month, and they give you commissions. But they</br>   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really</br>   beneficial to work there.</br> </br> </br>   And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know</br>   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be</br>   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they</br>   discriminated [against] me because of my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. They would talk behind my</br>   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of</br>   classism in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high</br>   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were</br>   their slave.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think it's the same in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes with illegals. Exactly the same, because I would remember my</br>   dad going to work for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two or three weeks</span> and him asking for his pay and</br>   never getting paid because they would be like, &quot;I know where you live, I</br>   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and</br>   Customs Enforcement] right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Where did he work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and</br>   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;</br>   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in</br>   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter</br>   months and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">summer months</span> -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.</br>   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes</br>   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">half   of</span> the minimum wage or less.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And sometimes they wouldn't pay him, you said, at all because -</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yeah, at all, because they told him, &quot;Well, you're illegal. We</br>   don't have to pay you, so bye&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What job is your aunt's?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: My aunt's is at a call center.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh, it's a call center. Do you feel safe in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful</br>   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the</br>   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she</br>   told me that there have never been cartels there until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years ago</span> [when]</br>   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're</br>   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if</br>   they're not home by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a certain hour</span>, they'll kill them, and they do. And</br>   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,</br>   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have</br>   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --</br>   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of</br>   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.     </span><span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. Have you been the victim of a crime?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you feel vulnerable as a returning migrant, as somebody who lived</br>   in the states and come back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So would you say it's been difficult to come back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I'm going to read you some things[from the survey] and you'll just</br>   tell me whether: ... finding a job, has that been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: It's been very difficult.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Other economic challenges?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes. My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're</br>   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like</br>   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel</br>   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --</br>   I'd be like, &quot;Why do <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanics</span> all live together? Like grandparents, kids,</br>   grandkids?” But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's</br>   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which</br>   is like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">three hundred dollars</span> a month, you really can't afford anything,</br>   and when the houses here are over <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">three to six million pesos</span>, which is like</br>   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What about continuing your education?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Family separation? Is that difficult?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: It's been hard because my parents are the only people I've known my</br>   whole life and they're my rocks, the people I go to for everything. So</br>   having them so distant has been really tough on me [Emotional]. I feel like</br>   I can't talk to my own grandparents because I don't have that trust and</br>   sometimes I just don't feel like there will ever be a connection since I've</br>   lost so many years of my life that I should have lived with them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Has it been hard to find friends and make friends?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes, very hard, because they think that you're stuck-up, or [ask]</br>   &quot;Why do you have different ways of thinking?&quot; Or they just think bad of</br>   you, just because you're not from here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What are the different ways of thinking that you've noticed between</br>   you and the people you meet here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Whenever I say I would like to be independent. I told my</br>   grandparents, &quot;You know what, I'm really thankful for my stay here, but I</br>   would like to grow independent.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Arkansas</span>, everybody leaves at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>. They go to study and they really never</br>   go back. And I told my grandparents, &quot;Well that's how things happen back</br>   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.” And</br>   they said, &quot;Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until</br>   you're married.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,</br>   &quot;You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with</br>   God, then you don't know what family is.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well I think there</br>   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,</br>   because it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> different things. You can't mix things like that</br>   together.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about language? Has that been hard?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes. When I first came here, I didn't understand almost anything</br>   they told me. Like I said, when I was learning <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, I would just learn</br>   it by ear, and right now I'm learning [<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>] by ear, but I still</br>   struggle sometimes to understand what they're trying to tell me. I tell</br>   them to say it maybe <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> times to me because I really don't</br>   understand.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Adapting to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> culture?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes. It's really tough.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you faced discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Bureaucratic difficulties?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes, so many.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you been depressed?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Recently, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Any substance abuse or addiction?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you still have family living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, your parents. Anybody</br>   else?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No, I consider them my only family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Are they <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizens?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No. When I called my parents, they were like, &quot;Do you recommend</br>   [coming back]?&quot; My dad's been gone for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">twenty years</span>. He's like, &quot;Maybe</br>   because we've been gone for that long, maybe things have changed,</br>   especially with the new president.&quot; But I said, &quot;No. Nothing has changed,</br>   and I don't even know how it was back then, but it's horrible now. So I</br>   think you should just stay.” [Sometimes] my dad tells me over the phone,</br>   &quot;I've been gone for so long -- since I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nineteen</span> -- that I feel like if</br>   I go back, I won't even feel like it's my home.” He's just so used to the</br>   culture there -- that's what he grew up with in his adult years.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So are they considering coming to live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> then, your parents?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No. Do you currently follow what's going on in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How? Social media, TV, radio, newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes, and my friends call me. They always call me,</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I want to ask you <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> more question. Something that we're working on</br>   is… what the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> is losing and what <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> could gain because of people</br>   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation. What do you think</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> loses by losing people like you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Well, they're losing their own people -- people like me and</br>   thousands and millions of others that never really knew their country and</br>   grew up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> and consider that their country. I would've given</br>   everything for it because I feel like that's my home.</br> </br> </br>   They're losing all our knowledge, what we could have studied and also given</br>   back to our communities and country: new research, work, new ways of</br>   thinking, new technology, and a lot of things that they could have had, but</br>   don't, [because] we can't.</br> </br> </br>   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no</br>   opportunity, no way out, because they put so many barriers here, like</br>   telling me that I can't go to college because—well, I understand it -- but</br>   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they</br>   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees</br>   can't and why <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Japanese</span> people or white people from England or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Britain</span> can</br>   come and go directly in without knowing any history or almost minimum</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So what would you tell <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> that they're gaining by having you</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: They're gaining a new way of thinking and lifestyle and new ideas</br>   so we can grow our economy and our country can be better now, since we are</br>   bringing in all these new ideas and ways of thinking and culture.</br> </br> </br>   We can also implement new jobs in [new] ways for our own citizens to live</br>   so we can have a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> world, not a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> world anymore.</br> </br> </br>   It's really tough living like this and it's really tough living here with</br>   fear. My grandparents are living in fear with all the cartels and</br>   everything in the government. If things happen, you can't even rely on</br>   police, or you can't even rely on a single ambulance. Recently my</br>   grandfather had a stroke and the ambulance came <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">an hour later</span> so we had to</br>   get the taxi. Things like that, simple things like that. The government is</br>   never on time and they are always corrupt and you always have to pay them</br>   off and they never do their job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you bring values to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> that you think would be good for</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I bring values like being genuine and straight up with people and</br>   not cheating and going the easy way and working it through. Because</br>   honestly here I see that there's so much cheating and saying so many lies</br>   just to get into positions of power and not even having to study or</br>   anything. There are a lot of people I've known and my grandparents have</br>   known who tell me, &quot;Oh yeah, he's a doctor, but he didn't even study to be</br>   a doctor. He just bought his certificate somewhere.&quot; And you're like, &quot;How</br>   are they working there?&quot; And they could all be like almost killing a</br>   patient and they would be fine with it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Were you a good student in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes, I got accepted into many colleges there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What colleges?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Well, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">University of Arkansas</span>, UALR [University of Arkansas at</br>   Little Rock], <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">University of Fayetteville</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">University of Southern Illinois</span>.</br>   Yeah, I got in there.... <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">UIC</span> [University of Illinois at Chicago] into. I</br>   got into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Louisiana State</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Baylor</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: My GPA was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">4.0</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yeah. It was really high because my parents always told me, &quot;Since</br>   you're illegal, you will never have opportunities here. So if you want to</br>   make it, even in your own country, you have to have a high standard.&quot; I had</br>   over 500 hours of community service, because I said, &quot;Well, maybe I won't</br>   get citizenship, but maybe by my merits I might.&quot; I would have so many</br>   hours. I would dedicate myself to school, go to tutoring <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">every afternoon</span>,</br>   dedicate myself to doing my homework and studying and being on top of</br>   everything, but no.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What were your favorite subjects?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: History and literature, or composition.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And history, which history? History of what do you like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: World history, starting from Mesopotamia to Rome and Greece,</br>   everything. I just like knowing everything from the bottom and where it</br>   came from because [history] repeats itself.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I have one more reflection question. Some women who we have spoken</br>   to who, like you, were undocumented in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> end up in trouble. Some</br>   become young mothers as teenagers, some join gangs. If somebody asked you,</br>   &quot;Why does this happen?&quot; what would you say?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: I would say that a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latinas</span>, especially young <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latinas</span> have</br>   kids or [join] gangs. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latinos</span> have that mentality that you have to get</br>   married very young and that women are just used for recreation, having a</br>   family -- not for anything else because we have that type of … it's a man's</br>   world here. It's not a woman's world. So if things back home were kind of</br>   tough for women, here it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">a million</span> times worse, because we're really</br>   oppressed and we still have rights, but you still aren't respected as a</br>   woman, and so many women just go the easy way, saying, &quot;Well I'll get</br>   pregnant early and finish it off and just live the rest of my life with my</br>   kids and dedicate myself to them,&quot; or some women don't want to do that and</br>   they just say, &quot;Well, I want money and I know I don't have opportunities</br>   because of the economy and all of the things that are happening in my</br>   background, so I guess I'll just join a gang and do all these things so I</br>   can have easy money and opportunities for other things.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why didn't you follow that path?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Because I have ambition for my career, and I've always really</br>   wanted this career. It's the same career my dad wanted. He wanted to be a</br>   politician, and I really wanted it too, not because of him, but because I</br>   would see how people would live and then I would be like ... in my own</br>   country it's even worse.</br> </br> </br>   I just want to make a change. I want it to be better. I feel like the only</br>   way to make a difference here is not what the president, the new one, is</br>   doing. I feel like you have to get at everything from the root and change.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So when you talk about, I get confused when you talk about my</br>   country, which country we're talking about.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: When you think about in the future, sort of becoming a politician or</br>   doing something, are you talking about making a change here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melani</span>: Yes. I think I will never go back and live in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. I would visit</br>   because that's where I feel like I belong, but I feel like I'm needed</br>   elsewhere. And I would really love to have an opportunity to work in the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Senate</span> or the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Congress</span>, or work in the consulate of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reasons, Family reunification, Economic">Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States?     Melani: My dad wanted to have a job in Arkansas because his biological   father was living there.     Anita: So would you say, for family reunification?     Melani: Yes, and also for work.    </span> Anita: Okay. How did you cross the border? Did you have a visa or did you</br>   just cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Both my parents had work permits and they paid a coyote to cross</br>   me.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I crossed through with a car in the desert. Well they had a contact</br>   that they had a kid that was around my age and they made me go through as a</br>   boy. And so—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. As someone else's child. I got dressed up as a boy so I could</br>   cross the border with this other person, and my parents told me that I was</br>   supposed to be in San Antonio at seven at night because that's what the</br>   coyote told my parents, and they didn't find me until four in the morning.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, so my parents thought I was already sold to the organ trade</br>   or something. My mom was scared and then she found the coyote but they had</br>   issues crossing and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was a pretty scary experience?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was pretty [Affirmative sound]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Before they dressed you like a boy, did you have long hair?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes I did [Affirmative sound], but they cut it all off so I could</br>   cross with them [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were two?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was two. I don't remember anything. They made me go as someone</br>   else's child [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your parents tell you what happened? How did you get lost? Do</br>   they know?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They said that the coyote told them that he was going to call them</br>   at seven as soon as they got there, but they never called them and they</br>   didn't know where to look because they had no other contact with him</br>   whatsoever. Until later on that night, they said that they got a call from</br>   him at four in the morning and my mom was already scared, but they couldn't</br>   go to any authority because it was something illegal to do. So they just</br>   picked me up and they just paid him off and then it was over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, my grandfather was a US citizen, but we never got anything from</br>   him because it was the first time my dad had ever met him and he didn't</br>   want to receive any of his help because he would charge him later on.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because he would what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: He would like…if he received anything from his dad, he would later</br>   on tell him that everything he had is because of him. He’d be in debt</br>   forever.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So it wasn't a great reunion?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Negative sound] no, my dad had never met him in all his life. He</br>   was 19 when he left.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was horrible because my grandfather had three restaurants and</br>   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad. In</br>   Arkansas at that time it was seven dollars an hour and he would give my dad</br>   three dollars an hour [Pause] in his restaurant, and my dad figured out</br>   that he would only employ illegals, and especially Native Americans that</br>   didn't speak Spanish—that they spoke dialects so they wouldn't understand</br>   what was going on—and since they didn't know anything because it was a new</br>   country to them, he could exploit them and never report taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your grandfather who was originally from Mexico…</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and he came before 1983, which was the amnesty. Yeah, and he</br>   got his citizenship from that. His whole family got it, and then he went to</br>   look for my dad when he was eighteen or nineteen and he told him, &quot;Come</br>   with me so you can work and we can actually be a family,&quot; because my dad</br>   had never seen him his whole life and my dad wanted a relationship with him</br>   he said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and he said, &quot;Maybe I can have a better job over there and</br>   stuff,&quot; and my grandfather was like, &quot;Come and I'll support you.&quot; So my dad</br>   came and then later on, the next six months passed and he brought my mom</br>   and then another year passed and then he brought me [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: we hear about Americans exploiting—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound] and now it's Hispanics exploiting Hispanics.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Pause]You didn't speak any English when you went?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you learned English?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Nobody really taught me. I would just go to school and listen to</br>   everybody's voices—I just went into school knowing just basic English, like</br>   &quot;Can I go to the restroom?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; or &quot;I don't understand.&quot;</br>   Those were the three words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of</br>   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How would you describe your English skills now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Fluent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: ____ Arkansas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You went to school. How much schooling did you complete?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Um—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What grade did you complete?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I just finished my high school diploma, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Both my parents.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Anyone else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Never [Negative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Siblings? No?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. I have no siblings.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of US authorities?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your family send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many times a year, more or less?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Every month, so twelve times a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you know about how much, guessing?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Maybe a thousand a month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Sixteen years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sixteen years. So, let's stop for a second. You said you were afraid</br>   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew</br>   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I</br>   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico. They</br>   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because</br>   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had</br>   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities</br>   might come and get my parents.</br> </br> </br>   They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here</br>   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I</br>   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's</br>   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for</br>   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off</br>   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen</br>   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from</br>   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same</br>   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, &quot;Why can't you go</br>   to the hospital?&quot; Or, &quot;Why can't you apply for certain things, government</br>   things?&quot; And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was</br>   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the</br>   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,</br>   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we</br>   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like</br>   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like to live having to keep such a secret?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Pause] I'd be frightened and I mean—I just didn't like that life.</br>   I guess that's why I chose to come back here. But sometimes I question if</br>   coming back here was the best choice or not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: let’s pause the survey and talk—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I guess it’s because ... it's not home and people have a different</br>   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many</br>   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew</br>   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the</br>   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more</br>   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church</br>   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, you said “back home.” “Back home” for you is the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You consider the US your home?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I consider it home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does home mean to you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means</br>   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's</br>   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel</br>   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my</br>   whole life.</br> </br> </br>   But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is seventy-five</br>   percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being Hispanic</br>   or always the question would be, &quot;Are you legal or are you illegal?&quot; And I</br>   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society</br>   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, &quot;What's home?&quot;</br>   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I</br>   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in Arkansas because I</br>   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back</br>   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow US news when you were in the</br>   states?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,</br>   radio, newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped</br>   immigrants. I was there for four years and I helped kids apply for DACA</br>   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because</br>   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go</br>   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, “What if it all</br>   falls down and we're the first ones to get deported?”</br> </br> </br>   So, my parents would be scared and they also…we saw the limitations. You</br>   would have to pay three times the tuition and you couldn't really get a lot</br>   of scholarships. So, there was no way for me to go to college if I would</br>   have to pay so much—even more than what my parents would receive in a year,</br>   because my parents would receive like $20,000 or less a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even if you had gotten—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: DACA, it wouldn't really work for me because I could only work with</br>   that and I couldn't study. And what I wanted to do was study and actually</br>   be able to travel and visit new places and have more opportunities and not</br>   just be stuck in one place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you have studied?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Political science and international relations.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that</br>   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me</br>   it's better if you go to Mexico before you’re eighteen—I mean after you're</br>   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days—I mean</br>   you have to not exceed 180 days—so you can be able to apply and not have</br>   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.</br> </br> </br>   My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to</br>   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from</br>   the States.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I</br>   want to stay here [in the US],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the</br>   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,</br>   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because</br>   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to</br>   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --</br>   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart</br>   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to</br>   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't</br>   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I</br>   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of</br>   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New</br>   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City—it's like thirty-six hours.</br> </br> </br>   And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours</br>   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four</br>   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.</br> </br> </br>   I chose one in Vancouver—Douglas College first, and I got a full</br>   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,</br>   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago—to Mexico City. The</br>   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out</br>   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can</br>   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great</br>   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant</br>   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian</br>   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and</br>   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.</br> </br> </br>   I just felt more at home there than even Mexico, because here I still get</br>   discriminated against for not speaking my language well. And I get</br>   discriminated against because they're like, &quot;Well, you're still Hispanic.</br>   You're not anything more. You're not special or you're not more than us</br>   just because you lived in the US.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you're going to Douglas --?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Douglas College.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is in Vancouver?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Vancouver.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where else did you apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: York University and Winnipeg University and I also applied to the</br>   University of Ottawa, where I also got in. But since Douglas University</br>   gave me a full scholarship for two years, I said I'll choose that one, and</br>   those [the other colleges] were partial scholarships.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I really loved York, but my mom said, &quot;Well just go wherever the</br>   money is at, where the full scholarship is at.&quot; And I went and I loved it.</br>   I really loved it and it felt more like…well not like Arkansas, but similar</br>   to the culture back in the US, so I liked that. I just don't feel</br>   identified in either place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, wait a minute, we have a lot to fill in [survey</br>   questions]. You followed the news, you said through TV and newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which newspapers do you read?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: The Hispanic ones like La Opinión or Latino Times, [Pause] Since my</br>   coalition would partner up with them and give them all the information,</br>   because my coalition would go talk to senators, the governor, and everyone</br>   else, and we also went to New Orleans and Arizona to fight for people's</br>   rights, and even to Washington DC.</br> </br> </br>   I would volunteer more than …in the summer, I would do more than over two</br>   hundred hours. I would work full time there without pay. I just really</br>   loved that work because I knew the struggle and I knew that almost all the</br>   kids in my school who were Latino and were about to graduate could not have</br>   the opportunity to go to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you basically think that DACA or the DREAMers don't work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. Yes. I think you really don't get an advantage from it because</br>   you might be able to work, have a driver's license, have an ID, but they'll</br>   overcharge you for college. An immigrant will never be able to get the</br>   amount of money [for college that they need], especially if they're</br>   illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican news?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never followed Mexican news.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So [reading the survey questions] you qualified for DACA but you</br>   didn't apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was risky.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: and you made the decision to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I remember leaving and my dad calling me when I was in the waiting</br>   room for the flight. He said, &quot;You know what? Just turn around and come</br>   back. We'll fix it. We'll find something. [Starts crying] we'll find you a</br>   job and we might be able to pay for college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   But I said, &quot;No. I have to go.&quot; [Cries] I’m sorry. So I left and I came</br>   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.</br>   She's like, &quot;Do you see me?&quot; But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not</br>   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, &quot;Where are</br>   you? I can't find you,&quot; and she said, &quot;I don't see you either.&quot; She was</br>   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, &quot;Oh.&quot; And she's like,</br>   &quot;I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.”</br> </br> </br>   I met her and it's just ... I didn't really feel a connection there because</br>   I never really talked to her. I don't think I ever spoke to her once in my</br>   life. I know I spoke to my mom's parents and her grandparents because they</br>   came to visit us, but it wasn't ... they would visit and stay for a week or</br>   two, but I really never felt anything because it'd be like, oh, they're</br>   your grandparents, but you never had much time to spend with them or have</br>   experiences with them, if it's such a limited time they're with you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative sound]. Are you living with that grandmother now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And ... I'm just going to go through this [the survey] okay? So how</br>   long have you been back, a month?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I do live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live with your grandparents, right?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you become aware of programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, like New Comienzos. My mom always told me before I would come,</br>   &quot;You should be a part of New Comienzos. I found out about it on the</br>   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think</br>   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and</br>   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is</br>   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]. And they told me that I</br>   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican</br>   history—not even the National Anthem.</br> </br> </br>   And I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll study again, one or two years of high school</br>   since I don't have certain classes that they require, and I have to take</br>   their admission test as well.” I [told myself], &quot; I feel like that would</br>   have been a waste of my time when everybody my age is already starting to</br>   go to college.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, I might be able to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   My aunt [also] told me, &quot;If you want a job you can work with me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I soon realized that jobs here aren't like jobs back home. Jobs here are</br>   very… they pay you very little. They pay you what my mom or my dad would</br>   get in like two days. I would get 6,500 pesos for a whole month, and I</br>   would start at eight in the morning. I only worked there for five days, or</br>   I'll just say a week.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was in a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: In a call center -- from seven in the morning to six in the</br>   afternoon.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Six thousand pesos per what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: 6,500 pesos per month, and they give you commissions. But they</br>   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really</br>   beneficial to work there.</br> </br> </br>   And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know</br>   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be</br>   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they</br>   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my</br>   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of</br>   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high</br>   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were</br>   their slave.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's the same in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes with illegals. Exactly the same, because I would remember my</br>   dad going to work for two or three weeks and him asking for his pay and</br>   never getting paid because they would be like, &quot;I know where you live, I</br>   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and</br>   Customs Enforcement] right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and</br>   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;</br>   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in</br>   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter</br>   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.</br>   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes</br>   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—half</br>   of the minimum wage or less.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And sometimes they wouldn't pay him, you said, at all because -</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, at all, because they told him, &quot;Well, you're illegal. We</br>   don't have to pay you, so bye&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job is your aunt's?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My aunt's is at a call center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, it's a call center. Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful</br>   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the</br>   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she</br>   told me that there have never been cartels there until two years ago [when]</br>   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're</br>   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if</br>   they're not home by a certain hour, they'll kill them, and they do. And</br>   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,</br>   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have</br>   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --</br>   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of</br>   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think Mexico</br>   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Have you been the victim of a crime?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel vulnerable as a returning migrant, as somebody who lived</br>   in the states and come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So would you say it's been difficult to come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm going to read you some things[from the survey] and you'll just</br>   tell me whether: ... finding a job, has that been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been very difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Other economic challenges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're</br>   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like</br>   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel</br>   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --</br>   I'd be like, &quot;Why do Hispanics all live together? Like grandparents, kids,</br>   grandkids?” But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's</br>   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which</br>   is like three hundred dollars a month, you really can't afford anything,</br>   and when the houses here are over three to six million pesos, which is like</br>   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about continuing your education?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Family separation? Is that difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been hard because my parents are the only people I've known my</br>   whole life and they're my rocks, the people I go to for everything. So</br>   having them so distant has been really tough on me [Emotional]. I feel like</br>   I can't talk to my own grandparents because I don't have that trust and</br>   sometimes I just don't feel like there will ever be a connection since I've</br>   lost so many years of my life that I should have lived with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Has it been hard to find friends and make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, very hard, because they think that you're stuck-up, or [ask]</br>   &quot;Why do you have different ways of thinking?&quot; Or they just think bad of</br>   you, just because you're not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are the different ways of thinking that you've noticed between</br>   you and the people you meet here?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Whenever I say I would like to be independent. I told my</br>   grandparents, &quot;You know what, I'm really thankful for my stay here, but I</br>   would like to grow independent.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   In Arkansas, everybody leaves at 18. They go to study and they really never</br>   go back. And I told my grandparents, &quot;Well that's how things happen back</br>   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.” And</br>   they said, &quot;Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until</br>   you're married.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,</br>   &quot;You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with</br>   God, then you don't know what family is.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well I think there</br>   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,</br>   because it's two different things. You can't mix things like that</br>   together.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about language? Has that been hard?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. When I first came here, I didn't understand almost anything</br>   they told me. Like I said, when I was learning English, I would just learn</br>   it by ear, and right now I'm learning [Spanish] by ear, but I still</br>   struggle sometimes to understand what they're trying to tell me. I tell</br>   them to say it maybe three or four times to me because I really don't</br>   understand.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. It's really tough.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you faced discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, so many.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you been depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Recently, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Any substance abuse or addiction?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you still have family living in the US, your parents. Anybody</br>   else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, I consider them my only family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are they US citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. When I called my parents, they were like, &quot;Do you recommend</br>   [coming back]?&quot; My dad's been gone for twenty years. He's like, &quot;Maybe</br>   because we've been gone for that long, maybe things have changed,</br>   especially with the new president.&quot; But I said, &quot;No. Nothing has changed,</br>   and I don't even know how it was back then, but it's horrible now. So I</br>   think you should just stay.” [Sometimes] my dad tells me over the phone,</br>   &quot;I've been gone for so long -- since I was nineteen -- that I feel like if</br>   I go back, I won't even feel like it's my home.” He's just so used to the</br>   culture there -- that's what he grew up with in his adult years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So are they considering coming to live in Mexico then, your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No. Do you currently follow what's going on in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How? Social media, TV, radio, newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and my friends call me. They always call me,</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I want to ask you one more question. Something that we're working on</br>   is… what the US is losing and what Mexico could gain because of people</br>   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation. What do you think</br>   the US loses by losing people like you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, they're losing their own people -- people like me and</br>   thousands and millions of others that never really knew their country and</br>   grew up in the US and consider that their country. I would've given</br>   everything for it because I feel like that's my home.</br> </br> </br>   They're losing all our knowledge, what we could have studied and also given</br>   back to our communities and country: new research, work, new ways of</br>   thinking, new technology, and a lot of things that they could have had, but</br>   don't, [because] we can't.</br> </br> </br>   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no</br>   opportunity, no way out, because they put so many barriers here, like</br>   telling me that I can't go to college because—well, I understand it -- but</br>   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they</br>   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees</br>   can't and why Japanese people or white people from England or Britain can</br>   come and go directly in without knowing any history or almost minimum</br>   Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what would you tell Mexicans that they're gaining by having you</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They're gaining a new way of thinking and lifestyle and new ideas</br>   so we can grow our economy and our country can be better now, since we are</br>   bringing in all these new ideas and ways of thinking and culture.</br> </br> </br>   We can also implement new jobs in [new] ways for our own citizens to live</br>   so we can have a first world, not a third world anymore.</br> </br> </br>   It's really tough living like this and it's really tough living here with</br>   fear. My grandparents are living in fear with all the cartels and</br>   everything in the government. If things happen, you can't even rely on</br>   police, or you can't even rely on a single ambulance. Recently my</br>   grandfather had a stroke and the ambulance came an hour later so we had to</br>   get the taxi. Things like that, simple things like that. The government is</br>   never on time and they are always corrupt and you always have to pay them</br>   off and they never do their job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you bring values to Mexico that you think would be good for</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I bring values like being genuine and straight up with people and</br>   not cheating and going the easy way and working it through. Because</br>   honestly here I see that there's so much cheating and saying so many lies</br>   just to get into positions of power and not even having to study or</br>   anything. There are a lot of people I've known and my grandparents have</br>   known who tell me, &quot;Oh yeah, he's a doctor, but he didn't even study to be</br>   a doctor. He just bought his certificate somewhere.&quot; And you're like, &quot;How</br>   are they working there?&quot; And they could all be like almost killing a</br>   patient and they would be fine with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you a good student in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I got accepted into many colleges there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What colleges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, University of Arkansas, UALR [University of Arkansas at</br>   Little Rock], University of Fayetteville, University of Southern Illinois.</br>   Yeah, I got in there.... UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago] into. I</br>   got into Louisiana State and Baylor.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My GPA was a 4.0.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah. It was really high because my parents always told me, &quot;Since</br>   you're illegal, you will never have opportunities here. So if you want to</br>   make it, even in your own country, you have to have a high standard.&quot; I had</br>   over 500 hours of community service, because I said, &quot;Well, maybe I won't</br>   get citizenship, but maybe by my merits I might.&quot; I would have so many</br>   hours. I would dedicate myself to school, go to tutoring every afternoon,</br>   dedicate myself to doing my homework and studying and being on top of</br>   everything, but no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were your favorite subjects?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: History and literature, or composition.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And history, which history? History of what do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: World history, starting from Mesopotamia to Rome and Greece,</br>   everything. I just like knowing everything from the bottom and where it</br>   came from because [history] repeats itself.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I have one more reflection question. Some women who we have spoken</br>   to who, like you, were undocumented in the States end up in trouble. Some</br>   become young mothers as teenagers, some join gangs. If somebody asked you,</br>   &quot;Why does this happen?&quot; what would you say?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I would say that a lot of Latinas, especially young Latinas have</br>   kids or [join] gangs. Latinos have that mentality that you have to get</br>   married very young and that women are just used for recreation, having a</br>   family -- not for anything else because we have that type of … it's a man's</br>   world here. It's not a woman's world. So if things back home were kind of</br>   tough for women, here it's a million times worse, because we're really</br>   oppressed and we still have rights, but you still aren't respected as a</br>   woman, and so many women just go the easy way, saying, &quot;Well I'll get</br>   pregnant early and finish it off and just live the rest of my life with my</br>   kids and dedicate myself to them,&quot; or some women don't want to do that and</br>   they just say, &quot;Well, I want money and I know I don't have opportunities</br>   because of the economy and all of the things that are happening in my</br>   background, so I guess I'll just join a gang and do all these things so I</br>   can have easy money and opportunities for other things.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why didn't you follow that path?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Melani: Because I have ambition for my career, and I've always really   wanted this career. It's the same career my dad wanted. He wanted to be a   politician, and I really wanted it too, not because of him, but because I   would see how people would live and then I would be like ... in my own   country it's even worse.     I just want to make a change. I want it to be better. I feel like the only   way to make a difference here is not what the president, the new one, is   doing. I feel like you have to get at everything from the root and change.    </span> Anita: So when you talk about, I get confused when you talk about my</br>   country, which country we're talking about.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you think about in the future, sort of becoming a politician or</br>   doing something, are you talking about making a change here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Melani: Yes. I think I will never go back and live in the US. I would visit   because that's where I feel like I belong, but I feel like I'm needed   elsewhere. And I would really love to have an opportunity to work in the   Senate or the Congress, or work in the consulate of Mexico in another   coun</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in the US">Melani: No. When I called my parents, they were like, &quot;Do you recommend   [coming back]?&quot; My dad's been gone for twenty years.

You can't mix things like that   together.”    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Melani: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—half   of the minimum wage or less.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Living undocumented, Hiding/lying">Melani: Yes with illegals. Exactly the same, because I would remember my   dad going to work for two or three weeks and him asking for his pay and   never getting paid because they would be like, &quot;I know where you live, I   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and   Customs Enforcement] right now.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being">Melani: 6,500 pesos per month, and they give you commissions. But they   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really   beneficial to work there.     And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were   their slave.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being">I soon realized that jobs here aren't like jobs back home. Jobs here are   very… they pay you very little. They pay you what my mom or my dad would   get in like two days. I would get 6,500 pesos for a whole month, and I   would start at eight in the morning. I only worked there for five days, or   I'll just say a week.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Continuing education">And I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll study again, one or two years of high school   since I don't have certain classes that they require, and I have to take   their admission test as well.” I [told myself], &quot; I feel like that would   have been a waste of my time when everybody my age is already starting to   go to college.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, I might be able to do this.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in Mexico">I met her and it's just ... I didn't really feel a connection there because   I never really talked to her. I don't think I ever spoke to her once in my   life. I know I spoke to my mom's parents and her grandparents because they   came to visit us, but it wasn't ... they would visit and stay for a week or   two, but I really never felt anything because it'd be like, oh, they're   your grandparents, but you never had much time to spend with them or have   experiences with them, if it's such a limited time they're with you.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Leaving the US">But I said, &quot;No. I have to go.&quot; [Cries] I’m sorry. So I left and I came   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.   She's like, &quot;Do you see me?&quot; But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, &quot;Where are   you? I can't find you,&quot; and she said, &quot;I don't see you either.&quot; She was   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, &quot;Oh.&quot; And she's like,   &quot;I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?&quot;   And I was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.”    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Paying For, Voluntary Departure">Melani: I remember leaving and my dad calling me when I was in the waiting   room for the flight. He said, &quot;You know what? Just turn around and come   back. We'll fix it. We'll find something. [Starts crying] we'll find you a   job and we might be able to pay for college.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, DACA, Fear">Anita: So [reading the survey questions] you qualified for DACA but you   didn't apply?     Melani: No.     Anita: Because?     Melani: It was risky.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, DACA, Fear">Melani: Yes. Yes. I think you really don't get an advantage from it because   you might be able to work, have a driver's license, have an ID, but they'll   overcharge you for college. An immigrant will never be able to get the   amount of money [for college that they need], especially if they're   illegal.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, US government and immigration">Melani: The Hispanic ones like La Opinión or Latino Times, [Pause] Since my   coalition would partner up with them and give them all the information,   because my coalition would go talk to senators, the governor, and everyone   else, and we also went to New Orleans and Arizona to fight for people's   rights, and even to Washington DC.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Education, College">Melani: York University and Winnipeg University and I also applied to the   University of Ottawa, where I also got in. But since Douglas University   gave me a full scholarship for two years, I said I'll choose that one, and   those [the other colleges] were partial scholarships.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, DACA">Melani: DACA, it wouldn't really work for me because I could only work with   that and I couldn't study. And what I wanted to do was study and actually   be able to travel and visit new places and have more opportunities and not   just be stuck in one place.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, DACA, Fear">So, my parents would be scared and they also…we saw the limitations. You   would have to pay three times the tuition and you couldn't really get a lot   of scholarships. So, there was no way for me to go to college if I would   have to pay so much—even more than what my parents would receive in a year,   because my parents would receive like $20,000 or less a year.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, US government and immigration">Anita: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow US news when you were in the   states?     Melani: Yes.     Anita: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,   radio, newspapers?     Melani: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped   immigrants. I was there for four years and I helped kids apply for DACA   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, “What if it all   falls down and we're the first ones to get deported?”    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Hiding/lying, In the shadows">Melani: Yes.</span> As someone else's child. I got dressed up as a boy so I could</br>   cross the border with this other person, and my parents told me that I was</br>   supposed to be in San Antonio at seven at night because that's what the</br>   coyote told my parents, and they didn't find me until four in the morning.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, so my parents thought I was already sold to the organ trade</br>   or something. My mom was scared and then she found the coyote but they had</br>   issues crossing and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was a pretty scary experience?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was pretty [Affirmative sound]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Before they dressed you like a boy, did you have long hair?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes I did [Affirmative sound], but they cut it all off so I could</br>   cross with them [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were two?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was two. I don't remember anything. They made me go as someone</br>   else's child [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your parents tell you what happened? How did you get lost? Do</br>   they know?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They said that the coyote told them that he was going to call them</br>   at seven as soon as they got there, but they never called them and they</br>   didn't know where to look because they had no other contact with him</br>   whatsoever. Until later on that night, they said that they got a call from</br>   him at four in the morning and my mom was already scared, but they couldn't</br>   go to any authority because it was something illegal to do. So they just</br>   picked me up and they just paid him off and then it was over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, my grandfather was a US citizen, but we never got anything from</br>   him because it was the first time my dad had ever met him and he didn't</br>   want to receive any of his help because he would charge him later on.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because he would what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: He would like…if he received anything from his dad, he would later</br>   on tell him that everything he had is because of him. He’d be in debt</br>   forever.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So it wasn't a great reunion?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Negative sound] no, my dad had never met him in all his life. He</br>   was 19 when he left.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was horrible because my grandfather had three restaurants and</br>   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad. In</br>   Arkansas at that time it was seven dollars an hour and he would give my dad</br>   three dollars an hour [Pause] in his restaurant, and my dad figured out</br>   that he would only employ illegals, and especially Native Americans that</br>   didn't speak Spanish—that they spoke dialects so they wouldn't understand</br>   what was going on—and since they didn't know anything because it was a new</br>   country to them, he could exploit them and never report taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your grandfather who was originally from Mexico…</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and he came before 1983, which was the amnesty. Yeah, and he</br>   got his citizenship from that. His whole family got it, and then he went to</br>   look for my dad when he was eighteen or nineteen and he told him, &quot;Come</br>   with me so you can work and we can actually be a family,&quot; because my dad</br>   had never seen him his whole life and my dad wanted a relationship with him</br>   he said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and he said, &quot;Maybe I can have a better job over there and</br>   stuff,&quot; and my grandfather was like, &quot;Come and I'll support you.&quot; So my dad</br>   came and then later on, the next six months passed and he brought my mom</br>   and then another year passed and then he brought me [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: we hear about Americans exploiting—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound] and now it's Hispanics exploiting Hispanics.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Pause]You didn't speak any English when you went?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you learned English?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Nobody really taught me. I would just go to school and listen to</br>   everybody's voices—I just went into school knowing just basic English, like</br>   &quot;Can I go to the restroom?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; or &quot;I don't understand.&quot;</br>   Those were the three words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of</br>   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How would you describe your English skills now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Fluent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: ____ Arkansas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You went to school.

I would just go to school and listen to</br>   everybody's voices—I just went into school knowing just basic English, like</br>   &quot;Can I go to the restroom?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; or &quot;I don't understand.&quot;</br>   Those were the three words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of</br>   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How would you describe your English skills now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Fluent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: ____ Arkansas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You went to school.

No?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. I have no siblings.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of US authorities?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your family send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many times a year, more or less?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Every month, so twelve times a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you know about how much, guessing?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Maybe a thousand a month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Sixteen years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sixteen years. So, let's stop for a second. You said you were afraid</br>   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew</br>   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I</br>   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico. They</br>   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because</br>   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had</br>   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities</br>   might come and get my parents.</br> </br> </br>   They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here</br>   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I</br>   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's</br>   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for</br>   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off</br>   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen</br>   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from</br>   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same</br>   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, &quot;Why can't you go</br>   to the hospital?&quot; Or, &quot;Why can't you apply for certain things, government</br>   things?&quot; And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was</br>   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the</br>   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,</br>   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we</br>   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like</br>   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like to live having to keep such a secret?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Pause] I'd be frightened and I mean—I just didn't like that life.</br>   I guess that's why I chose to come back here. But sometimes I question if</br>   coming back here was the best choice or not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: let’s pause the survey and talk—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I guess it’s because ... it's not home and people have a different</br>   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many</br>   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew</br>   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the</br>   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more</br>   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church</br>   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, you said “back home.” “Back home” for you is the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You consider the US your home?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I consider it home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does home mean to you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means</br>   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's</br>   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel</br>   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my</br>   whole life.</br> </br> </br>   But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is seventy-five</br>   percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being Hispanic</br>   or always the question would be, &quot;Are you legal or are you illegal?&quot; And I</br>   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society</br>   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, &quot;What's home?&quot;</br>   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I</br>   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in Arkansas because I</br>   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back</br>   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow US news when you were in the</br>   states?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,</br>   radio, newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped</br>   immigrants. I was there for four years and I helped kids apply for DACA</br>   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because</br>   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go</br>   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, “What if it all</br>   falls down and we're the first ones to get deported?”</br> </br> </br>   So, my parents would be scared and they also…we saw the limitations. You</br>   would have to pay three times the tuition and you couldn't really get a lot</br>   of scholarships. So, there was no way for me to go to college if I would</br>   have to pay so much—even more than what my parents would receive in a year,</br>   because my parents would receive like $20,000 or less a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even if you had gotten—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: DACA, it wouldn't really work for me because I could only work with</br>   that and I couldn't study. And what I wanted to do was study and actually</br>   be able to travel and visit new places and have more opportunities and not</br>   just be stuck in one place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you have studied?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Political science and international relations.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that</br>   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me</br>   it's better if you go to Mexico before you’re eighteen—I mean after you're</br>   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days—I mean</br>   you have to not exceed 180 days—so you can be able to apply and not have</br>   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.</br> </br> </br>   My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to</br>   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from</br>   the States.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I</br>   want to stay here [in the US],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the</br>   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,</br>   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because</br>   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to</br>   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --</br>   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart</br>   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to</br>   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't</br>   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I</br>   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of</br>   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New</br>   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City—it's like thirty-six hours.</br> </br> </br>   And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours</br>   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four</br>   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.</br> </br> </br>   I chose one in Vancouver—Douglas College first, and I got a full</br>   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,</br>   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago—to Mexico City. The</br>   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out</br>   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can</br>   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great</br>   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant</br>   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian</br>   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and</br>   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.</br> </br> </br>   I just felt more at home there than even Mexico, because here I still get</br>   discriminated against for not speaking my language well. And I get</br>   discriminated against because they're like, &quot;Well, you're still Hispanic.</br>   You're not anything more. You're not special or you're not more than us</br>   just because you lived in the US.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you're going to Douglas --?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Douglas College.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is in Vancouver?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Vancouver.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where else did you apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: York University and Winnipeg University and I also applied to the</br>   University of Ottawa, where I also got in. But since Douglas University</br>   gave me a full scholarship for two years, I said I'll choose that one, and</br>   those [the other colleges] were partial scholarships.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I really loved York, but my mom said, &quot;Well just go wherever the</br>   money is at, where the full scholarship is at.&quot; And I went and I loved it.</br>   I really loved it and it felt more like…well not like Arkansas, but similar</br>   to the culture back in the US, so I liked that. I just don't feel</br>   identified in either place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, wait a minute, we have a lot to fill in [survey</br>   questions]. You followed the news, you said through TV and newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which newspapers do you read?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: The Hispanic ones like La Opinión or Latino Times, [Pause] Since my</br>   coalition would partner up with them and give them all the information,</br>   because my coalition would go talk to senators, the governor, and everyone</br>   else, and we also went to New Orleans and Arizona to fight for people's</br>   rights, and even to Washington DC.</br> </br> </br>   I would volunteer more than …in the summer, I would do more than over two</br>   hundred hours. I would work full time there without pay. I just really</br>   loved that work because I knew the struggle and I knew that almost all the</br>   kids in my school who were Latino and were about to graduate could not have</br>   the opportunity to go to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you basically think that DACA or the DREAMers don't work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. Yes. I think you really don't get an advantage from it because</br>   you might be able to work, have a driver's license, have an ID, but they'll</br>   overcharge you for college. An immigrant will never be able to get the</br>   amount of money [for college that they need], especially if they're</br>   illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican news?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never followed Mexican news.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So [reading the survey questions] you qualified for DACA but you</br>   didn't apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was risky.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: and you made the decision to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I remember leaving and my dad calling me when I was in the waiting</br>   room for the flight. He said, &quot;You know what? Just turn around and come</br>   back. We'll fix it. We'll find something. [Starts crying] we'll find you a</br>   job and we might be able to pay for college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   But I said, &quot;No. I have to go.&quot; [Cries] I’m sorry. So I left and I came</br>   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.</br>   She's like, &quot;Do you see me?&quot; But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not</br>   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, &quot;Where are</br>   you? I can't find you,&quot; and she said, &quot;I don't see you either.&quot; She was</br>   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, &quot;Oh.&quot; And she's like,</br>   &quot;I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.”</br> </br> </br>   I met her and it's just ... I didn't really feel a connection there because</br>   I never really talked to her. I don't think I ever spoke to her once in my</br>   life. I know I spoke to my mom's parents and her grandparents because they</br>   came to visit us, but it wasn't ... they would visit and stay for a week or</br>   two, but I really never felt anything because it'd be like, oh, they're</br>   your grandparents, but you never had much time to spend with them or have</br>   experiences with them, if it's such a limited time they're with you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative sound]. Are you living with that grandmother now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And ... I'm just going to go through this [the survey] okay? So how</br>   long have you been back, a month?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I do live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live with your grandparents, right?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you become aware of programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, like New Comienzos. My mom always told me before I would come,</br>   &quot;You should be a part of New Comienzos. I found out about it on the</br>   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think</br>   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and</br>   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is</br>   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]. And they told me that I</br>   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican</br>   history—not even the National Anthem.</br> </br> </br>   And I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll study again, one or two years of high school</br>   since I don't have certain classes that they require, and I have to take</br>   their admission test as well.” I [told myself], &quot; I feel like that would</br>   have been a waste of my time when everybody my age is already starting to</br>   go to college.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, I might be able to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   My aunt [also] told me, &quot;If you want a job you can work with me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I soon realized that jobs here aren't like jobs back home. Jobs here are</br>   very… they pay you very little. They pay you what my mom or my dad would</br>   get in like two days. I would get 6,500 pesos for a whole month, and I</br>   would start at eight in the morning. I only worked there for five days, or</br>   I'll just say a week.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was in a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: In a call center -- from seven in the morning to six in the</br>   afternoon.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Six thousand pesos per what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: 6,500 pesos per month, and they give you commissions. But they</br>   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really</br>   beneficial to work there.</br> </br> </br>   And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know</br>   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be</br>   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they</br>   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my</br>   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of</br>   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high</br>   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were</br>   their slave.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's the same in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes with illegals. Exactly the same, because I would remember my</br>   dad going to work for two or three weeks and him asking for his pay and</br>   never getting paid because they would be like, &quot;I know where you live, I</br>   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and</br>   Customs Enforcement] right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and</br>   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;</br>   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in</br>   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter</br>   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.</br>   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes</br>   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—half</br>   of the minimum wage or less.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And sometimes they wouldn't pay him, you said, at all because -</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, at all, because they told him, &quot;Well, you're illegal. We</br>   don't have to pay you, so bye&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job is your aunt's?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My aunt's is at a call center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, it's a call center. Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful</br>   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the</br>   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she</br>   told me that there have never been cartels there until two years ago [when]</br>   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're</br>   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if</br>   they're not home by a certain hour, they'll kill them, and they do. And</br>   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,</br>   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have</br>   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --</br>   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of</br>   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think Mexico</br>   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Have you been the victim of a crime?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel vulnerable as a returning migrant, as somebody who lived</br>   in the states and come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So would you say it's been difficult to come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm going to read you some things[from the survey] and you'll just</br>   tell me whether: ... finding a job, has that been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been very difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Other economic challenges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're</br>   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like</br>   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel</br>   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --</br>   I'd be like, &quot;Why do Hispanics all live together? Like grandparents, kids,</br>   grandkids?” But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's</br>   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which</br>   is like three hundred dollars a month, you really can't afford anything,</br>   and when the houses here are over three to six million pesos, which is like</br>   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about continuing your education?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Family separation? Is that difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been hard because my parents are the only people I've known my</br>   whole life and they're my rocks, the people I go to for everything. So</br>   having them so distant has been really tough on me [Emotional]. I feel like</br>   I can't talk to my own grandparents because I don't have that trust and</br>   sometimes I just don't feel like there will ever be a connection since I've</br>   lost so many years of my life that I should have lived with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Has it been hard to find friends and make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, very hard, because they think that you're stuck-up, or [ask]</br>   &quot;Why do you have different ways of thinking?&quot; Or they just think bad of</br>   you, just because you're not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are the different ways of thinking that you've noticed between</br>   you and the people you meet here?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Whenever I say I would like to be independent. I told my</br>   grandparents, &quot;You know what, I'm really thankful for my stay here, but I</br>   would like to grow independent.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   In Arkansas, everybody leaves at 18. They go to study and they really never</br>   go back. And I told my grandparents, &quot;Well that's how things happen back</br>   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.” And</br>   they said, &quot;Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until</br>   you're married.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,</br>   &quot;You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with</br>   God, then you don't know what family is.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well I think there</br>   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,</br>   because it's two different things. You can't mix things like that</br>   together.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about language? Has that been hard?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. When I first came here, I didn't understand almost anything</br>   they told me. Like I said, when I was learning English, I would just learn</br>   it by ear, and right now I'm learning [Spanish] by ear, but I still</br>   struggle sometimes to understand what they're trying to tell me. I tell</br>   them to say it maybe three or four times to me because I really don't</br>   understand.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. It's really tough.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you faced discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, so many.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you been depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Recently, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Any substance abuse or addiction?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you still have family living in the US, your parents. Anybody</br>   else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, I consider them my only family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are they US citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. When I called my parents, they were like, &quot;Do you recommend</br>   [coming back]?&quot; My dad's been gone for twenty years. He's like, &quot;Maybe</br>   because we've been gone for that long, maybe things have changed,</br>   especially with the new president.&quot; But I said, &quot;No. Nothing has changed,</br>   and I don't even know how it was back then, but it's horrible now. So I</br>   think you should just stay.” [Sometimes] my dad tells me over the phone,</br>   &quot;I've been gone for so long -- since I was nineteen -- that I feel like if</br>   I go back, I won't even feel like it's my home.” He's just so used to the</br>   culture there -- that's what he grew up with in his adult years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So are they considering coming to live in Mexico then, your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No. Do you currently follow what's going on in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How? Social media, TV, radio, newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and my friends call me. They always call me,</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I want to ask you one more question. Something that we're working on</br>   is… what the US is losing and what Mexico could gain because of people</br>   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation. What do you think</br>   the US loses by losing people like you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, they're losing their own people -- people like me and</br>   thousands and millions of others that never really knew their country and</br>   grew up in the US and consider that their country. I would've given</br>   everything for it because I feel like that's my home.</br> </br> </br>   They're losing all our knowledge, what we could have studied and also given</br>   back to our communities and country: new research, work, new ways of</br>   thinking, new technology, and a lot of things that they could have had, but</br>   don't, [because] we can't.</br> </br> </br>   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no</br>   opportunity, no way out, because they put so many barriers here, like</br>   telling me that I can't go to college because—well, I understand it -- but</br>   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they</br>   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees</br>   can't and why Japanese people or white people from England or Britain can</br>   come and go directly in without knowing any history or almost minimum</br>   Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what would you tell Mexicans that they're gaining by having you</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They're gaining a new way of thinking and lifestyle and new ideas</br>   so we can grow our economy and our country can be better now, since we are</br>   bringing in all these new ideas and ways of thinking and culture.</br> </br> </br>   We can also implement new jobs in [new] ways for our own citizens to live</br>   so we can have a first world, not a third world anymore.</br> </br> </br>   It's really tough living like this and it's really tough living here with</br>   fear. My grandparents are living in fear with all the cartels and</br>   everything in the government. If things happen, you can't even rely on</br>   police, or you can't even rely on a single ambulance. Recently my</br>   grandfather had a stroke and the ambulance came an hour later so we had to</br>   get the taxi. Things like that, simple things like that. The government is</br>   never on time and they are always corrupt and you always have to pay them</br>   off and they never do their job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you bring values to Mexico that you think would be good for</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I bring values like being genuine and straight up with people and</br>   not cheating and going the easy way and working it through. Because</br>   honestly here I see that there's so much cheating and saying so many lies</br>   just to get into positions of power and not even having to study or</br>   anything. There are a lot of people I've known and my grandparents have</br>   known who tell me, &quot;Oh yeah, he's a doctor, but he didn't even study to be</br>   a doctor. He just bought his certificate somewhere.&quot; And you're like, &quot;How</br>   are they working there?&quot; And they could all be like almost killing a</br>   patient and they would be fine with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you a good student in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I got accepted into many colleges there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What colleges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, University of Arkansas, UALR [University of Arkansas at</br>   Little Rock], University of Fayetteville, University of Southern Illinois.</br>   Yeah, I got in there.... UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago] into. I</br>   got into Louisiana State and Baylor.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My GPA was a 4.0.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah. It was really high because my parents always told me, &quot;Since</br>   you're illegal, you will never have opportunities here. So if you want to</br>   make it, even in your own country, you have to have a high standard.&quot; I had</br>   over 500 hours of community service, because I said, &quot;Well, maybe I won't</br>   get citizenship, but maybe by my merits I might.&quot; I would have so many</br>   hours. I would dedicate myself to school, go to tutoring every afternoon,</br>   dedicate myself to doing my homework and studying and being on top of</br>   everything, but no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were your favorite subjects?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: History and literature, or composition.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And history, which history? History of what do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: World history, starting from Mesopotamia to Rome and Greece,</br>   everything. I just like knowing everything from the bottom and where it</br>   came from because [history] repeats itself.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Gangs">Anita: I have one more reflection question. Some women who we have spoken   to who, like you, were undocumented in the States end up in trouble. Some   become young mothers as teenagers, some join gangs. If somebody asked you,   &quot;Why does this happen?&quot; what would you say?     Melani: I would say that a lot of Latinas, especially young Latinas have   kids or [join] gangs. Latinos have that mentality that you have to get   married very young and that women are just used for recreation, having a   family -- not for anything else because we have that type of … it's a man's   world here. It's not a woman's world. So if things back home were kind of   tough for women, here it's a million times worse, because we're really   oppressed and we still have rights, but you still aren't respected as a   woman, and so many women just go the easy way, saying, &quot;Well I'll get   pregnant early and finish it off and just live the rest of my life with my   kids and dedicate myself to them,&quot; or some women don't want to do that and   they just say, &quot;Well, I want money and I know I don't have opportunities   because of the economy and all of the things that are happening in my   background, so I guess I'll just join a gang and do all these things so I   can have easy money and opportunities for other things.&quot;    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, What the US has lost">Anita: I want to ask you one more question. Something that we're working on   is… what the US is losing and what Mexico could gain because of people   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation.

I found out about it on the   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]. And they told me that I   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican   history—not even the National Anthem.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Education, DACA, College">Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?     Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me   it's better if you go to Mexico before you’re eighteen—I mean after you're   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days—I mean   you have to not exceed 180 days—so you can be able to apply and not have   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.     My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from   the States.&quot;     I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I   want to stay here [in the US],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;     I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City—it's like thirty-six hours.     And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.     I chose one in Vancouver—Douglas College first, and I got a full   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago—to Mexico City. The   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.     The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.    </span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Discrimination, Return to Mexico, Spanish, Learning English">I just felt more at home there than even Mexico, because here I still get   discriminated against for not speaking my language well.

Melani: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my   whole life.     But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is seventy-five   percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being Hispanic   or always the question would be, &quot;Are you legal or are you illegal?&quot; And I   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, &quot;What's home?&quot;   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in Arkansas because I   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Return to Mexico, Cultural">Melani: [Pause] I'd be frightened and I mean—I just didn't like that life.   I guess that's why I chose to come back here. But sometimes I question if   coming back here was the best choice or not.     Anita: let’s pause the survey and talk—     Melani: I guess it’s because ... it's not home and people have a different   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].     Anita: Yeah. So, you said “back home.” “Back home” for you is the US?     Melani: Yes.     Anita: You consider the US your home?     Melani: Yes, I consider it home.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Growing up undocumented, In the shadows, Police, Fear">Anita: Sixteen years. So, let's stop for a second. You said you were afraid   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.     Melani: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico. They   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities   might come and get my parents.     They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than   them.     I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, &quot;Why can't you go   to the hospital?&quot; Or, &quot;Why can't you apply for certain things, government   things?&quot; And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Age, Learning English,  self-taught">Anita: [Pause]You didn't speak any English when you went?     Melani: No.     Anita: But you learned English?     Melani: Yes.     Anita: How did you learn English?     Melani: Nobody really taught me. I would just go to school and listen to   everybody's voices—I just went into school knowing just basic English, like   &quot;Can I go to the restroom?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; or &quot;I don't understand.&quot;   Those were the three words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.     Anita: How would you describe your English skills now?     Melani: Fluent.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Family, Economic,  exploitation">Melani: It was horrible because my grandfather had three restaurants and   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad. In   Arkansas at that time it was seven dollars an hour and he would give my dad   three dollars an hour [Pause] in his restaurant, and my dad figured out   that he would only employ illegals, and especially Native Americans that   didn't speak Spanish—that they spoke dialects so they wouldn't understand   what was going on—and since they didn't know anything because it was a new   country to them, he could exploit them and never report taxes.     Anita: Your grandfather who was originally from Mexico…     Melani: Yes, and he came before 1983, which was the amnesty. Yeah, and he   got his citizenship from that. His whole family got it, and then he went to   look for my dad when he was eighteen or nineteen and he told him, &quot;Come   with me so you can work and we can actually be a family,&quot; because my dad   had never seen him his whole life and my dad wanted a relationship with him   he said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and he said, &quot;Maybe I can have a better job over there and   stuff,&quot; and my grandfather was like, &quot;Come and I'll support you.&quot; So my dad   came and then later on, the next six months passed and he brought my mom   and then another year passed and then he brought me [Affirmative sound].     Anita: we hear about Americans exploiting—     Melani: [Affirmative sound] and now it's Hispanics exploiting Hispanics.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Border crossing, Coyotes, Border crossing, Family reunification, Fear">Anita: Okay. How did you cross the border? Did you have a visa or did you   just cross the border?     Melani: Both my parents had work permits and they paid a coyote to cross   me.     Melani: I crossed through with a car in the desert. Well they had a contact   that they had a kid that was around my age and they made me go through as a   boy. And so—     Anita: Really?     Melani: Yes. As someone else's child. I got dressed up as a boy so I could   cross the border with this other person, and my parents told me that I was   supposed to be in San Antonio at seven at night because that's what the   coyote told my parents, and they didn't find me until four in the morning.     Anita: Oh my God.     Melani: Yeah, so my parents thought I was already sold to the organ trade   or something. My mom was scared and then she found the coyote but they had   issues crossing and everything.     Anita: It was a pretty scary experience?     Melani: It was pretty [Affirmative sound]—     Anita: Before they dressed you like a boy, did you have long hair?     Melani: Yes I did [Affirmative sound], but they cut it all off so I could   cross with them [Affirmative sound].     Anita: You were two?     Melani: I was two. I don't remember anything. They made me go as someone   else's child [Affirmative sound].     Anita: Did your parents tell you what happened? How did you get lost? Do   they know?     Melani: They said that the coyote told them that he was going to call them   at seven as soon as they got there, but they never called them and they   didn't know where to look because they had no other contact with him   whatsoever. Until later on that night, they said that they got a call from   him at four in the morning and my mom was already scared, but they couldn't   go to any authority because it was something illegal to do. So they just   picked me up and they just paid him off and then it was over.    </span> Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, my grandfather was a US citizen, but we never got anything from</br>   him because it was the first time my dad had ever met him and he didn't</br>   want to receive any of his help because he would charge him later on.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because he would what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: He would like…if he received anything from his dad, he would later</br>   on tell him that everything he had is because of him. He’d be in debt</br>   forever.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So it wasn't a great reunion?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Negative sound] no, my dad had never met him in all his life. He</br>   was 19 when he left.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was horrible because my grandfather had three restaurants and</br>   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad.

So, let's stop for a second. You said you were afraid</br>   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew</br>   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I</br>   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico.

So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the</br>   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,</br>   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we</br>   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like</br>   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like to live having to keep such a secret?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Pause] I'd be frightened and I mean—I just didn't like that life.</br>   I guess that's why I chose to come back here. But sometimes I question if</br>   coming back here was the best choice or not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: let’s pause the survey and talk—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I guess it’s because ... it's not home and people have a different</br>   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many</br>   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew</br>   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the</br>   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more</br>   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church</br>   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, you said “back home.” “Back home” for you is the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You consider the US your home?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I consider it home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does home mean to you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means</br>   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's</br>   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel</br>   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my</br>   whole life.</br> </br> </br>   But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is seventy-five</br>   percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being Hispanic</br>   or always the question would be, &quot;Are you legal or are you illegal?&quot; And I</br>   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society</br>   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, &quot;What's home?&quot;</br>   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I</br>   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in Arkansas because I</br>   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back</br>   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow US news when you were in the</br>   states?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,</br>   radio, newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped</br>   immigrants. I was there for four years and I helped kids apply for DACA</br>   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because</br>   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go</br>   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, “What if it all</br>   falls down and we're the first ones to get deported?”</br> </br> </br>   So, my parents would be scared and they also…we saw the limitations. You</br>   would have to pay three times the tuition and you couldn't really get a lot</br>   of scholarships. So, there was no way for me to go to college if I would</br>   have to pay so much—even more than what my parents would receive in a year,</br>   because my parents would receive like $20,000 or less a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even if you had gotten—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: DACA, it wouldn't really work for me because I could only work with</br>   that and I couldn't study. And what I wanted to do was study and actually</br>   be able to travel and visit new places and have more opportunities and not</br>   just be stuck in one place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you have studied?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Political science and international relations.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that</br>   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me</br>   it's better if you go to Mexico before you’re eighteen—I mean after you're</br>   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days—I mean</br>   you have to not exceed 180 days—so you can be able to apply and not have</br>   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.</br> </br> </br>   My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to</br>   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from</br>   the States.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I</br>   want to stay here [in the US],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the</br>   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,</br>   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because</br>   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to</br>   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --</br>   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart</br>   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to</br>   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't</br>   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I</br>   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of</br>   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New</br>   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City—it's like thirty-six hours.</br> </br> </br>   And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours</br>   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four</br>   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.</br> </br> </br>   I chose one in Vancouver—Douglas College first, and I got a full</br>   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,</br>   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago—to Mexico City. The</br>   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out</br>   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can</br>   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great</br>   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant</br>   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian</br>   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and</br>   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.</br> </br> </br>   I just felt more at home there than even Mexico, because here I still get</br>   discriminated against for not speaking my language well. And I get</br>   discriminated against because they're like, &quot;Well, you're still Hispanic.</br>   You're not anything more. You're not special or you're not more than us</br>   just because you lived in the US.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you're going to Douglas --?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Douglas College.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is in Vancouver?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Vancouver.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where else did you apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: York University and Winnipeg University and I also applied to the</br>   University of Ottawa, where I also got in. But since Douglas University</br>   gave me a full scholarship for two years, I said I'll choose that one, and</br>   those [the other colleges] were partial scholarships.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I really loved York, but my mom said, &quot;Well just go wherever the</br>   money is at, where the full scholarship is at.&quot; And I went and I loved it.</br>   I really loved it and it felt more like…well not like Arkansas, but similar</br>   to the culture back in the US, so I liked that. I just don't feel</br>   identified in either place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, wait a minute, we have a lot to fill in [survey</br>   questions]. You followed the news, you said through TV and newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which newspapers do you read?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: The Hispanic ones like La Opinión or Latino Times, [Pause] Since my</br>   coalition would partner up with them and give them all the information,</br>   because my coalition would go talk to senators, the governor, and everyone</br>   else, and we also went to New Orleans and Arizona to fight for people's</br>   rights, and even to Washington DC.</br> </br> </br>   I would volunteer more than …in the summer, I would do more than over two</br>   hundred hours. I would work full time there without pay. I just really</br>   loved that work because I knew the struggle and I knew that almost all the</br>   kids in my school who were Latino and were about to graduate could not have</br>   the opportunity to go to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you basically think that DACA or the DREAMers don't work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. Yes. I think you really don't get an advantage from it because</br>   you might be able to work, have a driver's license, have an ID, but they'll</br>   overcharge you for college. An immigrant will never be able to get the</br>   amount of money [for college that they need], especially if they're</br>   illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican news?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never followed Mexican news.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So [reading the survey questions] you qualified for DACA but you</br>   didn't apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was risky.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: and you made the decision to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I remember leaving and my dad calling me when I was in the waiting</br>   room for the flight. He said, &quot;You know what? Just turn around and come</br>   back. We'll fix it. We'll find something. [Starts crying] we'll find you a</br>   job and we might be able to pay for college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   But I said, &quot;No. I have to go.&quot; [Cries] I’m sorry. So I left and I came</br>   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.</br>   She's like, &quot;Do you see me?&quot; But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not</br>   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, &quot;Where are</br>   you? I can't find you,&quot; and she said, &quot;I don't see you either.&quot; She was</br>   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, &quot;Oh.&quot; And she's like,</br>   &quot;I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.”</br> </br> </br>   I met her and it's just ... I didn't really feel a connection there because</br>   I never really talked to her. I don't think I ever spoke to her once in my</br>   life. I know I spoke to my mom's parents and her grandparents because they</br>   came to visit us, but it wasn't ... they would visit and stay for a week or</br>   two, but I really never felt anything because it'd be like, oh, they're</br>   your grandparents, but you never had much time to spend with them or have</br>   experiences with them, if it's such a limited time they're with you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative sound]. Are you living with that grandmother now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And ... I'm just going to go through this [the survey] okay? So how</br>   long have you been back, a month?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I do live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live with your grandparents, right?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you become aware of programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, like New Comienzos. My mom always told me before I would come,</br>   &quot;You should be a part of New Comienzos. I found out about it on the</br>   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think</br>   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and</br>   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is</br>   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]. And they told me that I</br>   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican</br>   history—not even the National Anthem.</br> </br> </br>   And I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll study again, one or two years of high school</br>   since I don't have certain classes that they require, and I have to take</br>   their admission test as well.” I [told myself], &quot; I feel like that would</br>   have been a waste of my time when everybody my age is already starting to</br>   go to college.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, I might be able to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   My aunt [also] told me, &quot;If you want a job you can work with me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I soon realized that jobs here aren't like jobs back home. Jobs here are</br>   very… they pay you very little. They pay you what my mom or my dad would</br>   get in like two days. I would get 6,500 pesos for a whole month, and I</br>   would start at eight in the morning. I only worked there for five days, or</br>   I'll just say a week.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was in a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: In a call center -- from seven in the morning to six in the</br>   afternoon.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Six thousand pesos per what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: 6,500 pesos per month, and they give you commissions. But they</br>   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really</br>   beneficial to work there.</br> </br> </br>   And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know</br>   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be</br>   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they</br>   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my</br>   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of</br>   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high</br>   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were</br>   their slave.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's the same in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes with illegals. Exactly the same, because I would remember my</br>   dad going to work for two or three weeks and him asking for his pay and</br>   never getting paid because they would be like, &quot;I know where you live, I</br>   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and</br>   Customs Enforcement] right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and</br>   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;</br>   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in</br>   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter</br>   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.</br>   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes</br>   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—half</br>   of the minimum wage or less.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And sometimes they wouldn't pay him, you said, at all because -</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, at all, because they told him, &quot;Well, you're illegal. We</br>   don't have to pay you, so bye&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job is your aunt's?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My aunt's is at a call center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, it's a call center. Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful</br>   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the</br>   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she</br>   told me that there have never been cartels there until two years ago [when]</br>   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're</br>   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if</br>   they're not home by a certain hour, they'll kill them, and they do. And</br>   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,</br>   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have</br>   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --</br>   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of</br>   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think Mexico</br>   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Have you been the victim of a crime?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel vulnerable as a returning migrant, as somebody who lived</br>   in the states and come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So would you say it's been difficult to come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm going to read you some things[from the survey] and you'll just</br>   tell me whether: ... finding a job, has that been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been very difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Other economic challenges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're</br>   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like</br>   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel</br>   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --</br>   I'd be like, &quot;Why do Hispanics all live together? Like grandparents, kids,</br>   grandkids?” But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's</br>   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which</br>   is like three hundred dollars a month, you really can't afford anything,</br>   and when the houses here are over three to six million pesos, which is like</br>   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about continuing your education?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Family separation? Is that difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been hard because my parents are the only people I've known my</br>   whole life and they're my rocks, the people I go to for everything. So</br>   having them so distant has been really tough on me [Emotional]. I feel like</br>   I can't talk to my own grandparents because I don't have that trust and</br>   sometimes I just don't feel like there will ever be a connection since I've</br>   lost so many years of my life that I should have lived with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Has it been hard to find friends and make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, very hard, because they think that you're stuck-up, or [ask]</br>   &quot;Why do you have different ways of thinking?&quot; Or they just think bad of</br>   you, just because you're not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are the different ways of thinking that you've noticed between</br>   you and the people you meet here?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Whenever I say I would like to be independent. I told my</br>   grandparents, &quot;You know what, I'm really thankful for my stay here, but I</br>   would like to grow independent.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   In Arkansas, everybody leaves at 18. They go to study and they really never</br>   go back. And I told my grandparents, &quot;Well that's how things happen back</br>   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.” And</br>   they said, &quot;Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until</br>   you're married.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,</br>   &quot;You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with</br>   God, then you don't know what family is.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well I think there</br>   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,</br>   because it's two different things. You can't mix things like that</br>   together.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about language? Has that been hard?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. When I first came here, I didn't understand almost anything</br>   they told me. Like I said, when I was learning English, I would just learn</br>   it by ear, and right now I'm learning [Spanish] by ear, but I still</br>   struggle sometimes to understand what they're trying to tell me. I tell</br>   them to say it maybe three or four times to me because I really don't</br>   understand.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. It's really tough.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you faced discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, so many.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you been depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Recently, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Any substance abuse or addiction?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you still have family living in the US, your parents. Anybody</br>   else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, I consider them my only family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are they US citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. When I called my parents, they were like, &quot;Do you recommend</br>   [coming back]?&quot; My dad's been gone for twenty years. He's like, &quot;Maybe</br>   because we've been gone for that long, maybe things have changed,</br>   especially with the new president.&quot; But I said, &quot;No. Nothing has changed,</br>   and I don't even know how it was back then, but it's horrible now. So I</br>   think you should just stay.” [Sometimes] my dad tells me over the phone,</br>   &quot;I've been gone for so long -- since I was nineteen -- that I feel like if</br>   I go back, I won't even feel like it's my home.” He's just so used to the</br>   culture there -- that's what he grew up with in his adult years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So are they considering coming to live in Mexico then, your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No. Do you currently follow what's going on in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How? Social media, TV, radio, newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and my friends call me. They always call me,</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I want to ask you one more question. Something that we're working on</br>   is… what the US is losing and what Mexico could gain because of people</br>   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation. What do you think</br>   the US loses by losing people like you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, they're losing their own people -- people like me and</br>   thousands and millions of others that never really knew their country and</br>   grew up in the US and consider that their country. I would've given</br>   everything for it because I feel like that's my home.</br> </br> </br>   They're losing all our knowledge, what we could have studied and also given</br>   back to our communities and country: new research, work, new ways of</br>   thinking, new technology, and a lot of things that they could have had, but</br>   don't, [because] we can't.</br> </br> </br>   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no</br>   opportunity, no way out, because they put so many barriers here, like</br>   telling me that I can't go to college because—well, I understand it -- but</br>   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they</br>   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees</br>   can't and why Japanese people or white people from England or Britain can</br>   come and go directly in without knowing any history or almost minimum</br>   Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what would you tell Mexicans that they're gaining by having you</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They're gaining a new way of thinking and lifestyle and new ideas</br>   so we can grow our economy and our country can be better now, since we are</br>   bringing in all these new ideas and ways of thinking and culture.</br> </br> </br>   We can also implement new jobs in [new] ways for our own citizens to live</br>   so we can have a first world, not a third world anymore.</br> </br> </br>   It's really tough living like this and it's really tough living here with</br>   fear. My grandparents are living in fear with all the cartels and</br>   everything in the government. If things happen, you can't even rely on</br>   police, or you can't even rely on a single ambulance. Recently my</br>   grandfather had a stroke and the ambulance came an hour later so we had to</br>   get the taxi. Things like that, simple things like that. The government is</br>   never on time and they are always corrupt and you always have to pay them</br>   off and they never do their job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you bring values to Mexico that you think would be good for</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I bring values like being genuine and straight up with people and</br>   not cheating and going the easy way and working it through. Because</br>   honestly here I see that there's so much cheating and saying so many lies</br>   just to get into positions of power and not even having to study or</br>   anything. There are a lot of people I've known and my grandparents have</br>   known who tell me, &quot;Oh yeah, he's a doctor, but he didn't even study to be</br>   a doctor. He just bought his certificate somewhere.&quot; And you're like, &quot;How</br>   are they working there?&quot; And they could all be like almost killing a</br>   patient and they would be fine with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you a good student in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I got accepted into many colleges there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What colleges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, University of Arkansas, UALR [University of Arkansas at</br>   Little Rock], University of Fayetteville, University of Southern Illinois.</br>   Yeah, I got in there.... UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago] into. I</br>   got into Louisiana State and Baylor.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My GPA was a 4.0.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah. It was really high because my parents always told me, &quot;Since</br>   you're illegal, you will never have opportunities here. So if you want to</br>   make it, even in your own country, you have to have a high standard.&quot; I had</br>   over 500 hours of community service, because I said, &quot;Well, maybe I won't</br>   get citizenship, but maybe by my merits I might.&quot; I would have so many</br>   hours. I would dedicate myself to school, go to tutoring every afternoon,</br>   dedicate myself to doing my homework and studying and being on top of</br>   everything, but no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were your favorite subjects?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: History and literature, or composition.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And history, which history? History of what do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: World history, starting from Mesopotamia to Rome and Greece,</br>   everything. I just like knowing everything from the bottom and where it</br>   came from because [history] repeats itself.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I have one more reflection question. Some women who we have spoken</br>   to who, like you, were undocumented in the States end up in trouble. Some</br>   become young mothers as teenagers, some join gangs. If somebody asked you,</br>   &quot;Why does this happen?&quot; what would you say?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I would say that a lot of Latinas, especially young Latinas have</br>   kids or [join] gangs. Latinos have that mentality that you have to get</br>   married very young and that women are just used for recreation, having a</br>   family -- not for anything else because we have that type of … it's a man's</br>   world here. It's not a woman's world. So if things back home were kind of</br>   tough for women, here it's a million times worse, because we're really</br>   oppressed and we still have rights, but you still aren't respected as a</br>   woman, and so many women just go the easy way, saying, &quot;Well I'll get</br>   pregnant early and finish it off and just live the rest of my life with my</br>   kids and dedicate myself to them,&quot; or some women don't want to do that and</br>   they just say, &quot;Well, I want money and I know I don't have opportunities</br>   because of the economy and all of the things that are happening in my</br>   background, so I guess I'll just join a gang and do all these things so I</br>   can have easy money and opportunities for other things.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why didn't you follow that path?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Because I have ambition for my career, and I've always really</br>   wanted this career. It's the same career my dad wanted. He wanted to be a</br>   politician, and I really wanted it too, not because of him, but because I</br>   would see how people would live and then I would be like ... in my own</br>   country it's even worse.</br> </br> </br>   I just want to make a change. I want it to be better. I feel like the only</br>   way to make a difference here is not what the president, the new one, is</br>   doing. I feel like you have to get at everything from the root and change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you talk about, I get confused when you talk about my</br>   country, which country we're talking about.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you think about in the future, sort of becoming a politician or</br>   doing something, are you talking about making a change here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. I think I will never go back and live in the US. I would visit</br>   because that's where I feel like I belong, but I feel like I'm needed</br>   elsewhere. And I would really love to have an opportunity to work in the</br>   Senate or the Congress, or work in the consulate of Mexico in another</br>   country.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
