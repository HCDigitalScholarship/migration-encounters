 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: My dad wanted to have a job in Arkansas because his biological<br>
   father was living there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So would you say, for family reunification?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Yes, and also for work.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Okay. How did you cross the border? Did you have a visa or did you</br>   just cross the border?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Both my parents had work permits and they paid a coyote to cross</br>   me.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I crossed through with a car in the desert. Well they had a contact</br>   that they had a kid that was around my age and they made me go through as a</br>   boy. And so—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. As someone else's child. I got dressed up as a boy so I could</br>   cross the border with this other person, and my parents told me that I was</br>   supposed to be in San Antonio at seven at night because that's what the</br>   coyote told my parents, and they didn't find me until four in the morning.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, so my parents thought I was already sold to the organ trade</br>   or something. My mom was scared and then she found the coyote but they had</br>   issues crossing and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It was a pretty scary experience?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was pretty [Affirmative sound]—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Before they dressed you like a boy, did you have long hair?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes I did [Affirmative sound], but they cut it all off so I could</br>   cross with them [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You were two?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was two. I don't remember anything. They made me go as someone</br>   else's child [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your parents tell you what happened? How did you get lost? Do</br>   they know?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They said that the coyote told them that he was going to call them</br>   at seven as soon as they got there, but they never called them and they</br>   didn't know where to look because they had no other contact with him</br>   whatsoever. Until later on that night, they said that they got a call from</br>   him at four in the morning and my mom was already scared, but they couldn't</br>   go to any authority because it was something illegal to do. So they just</br>   picked me up and they just paid him off and then it was over.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, my grandfather was a US citizen, but we never got anything from</br>   him because it was the first time my dad had ever met him and he didn't</br>   want to receive any of his help because he would charge him later on.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because he would what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: He would like…if he received anything from his dad, he would later</br>   on tell him that everything he had is because of him. He’d be in debt</br>   forever.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So it wasn't a great reunion?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Negative sound] no, my dad had never met him in all his life. He</br>   was 19 when he left.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was horrible because my grandfather had three restaurants and</br>   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad. In</br>   Arkansas at that time it was seven dollars an hour and he would give my dad</br>   three dollars an hour [Pause] in his restaurant, and my dad figured out</br>   that he would only employ illegals, and especially Native Americans that</br>   didn't speak Spanish—that they spoke dialects so they wouldn't understand</br>   what was going on—and since they didn't know anything because it was a new</br>   country to them, he could exploit them and never report taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your grandfather who was originally from Mexico…</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and he came before 1983, which was the amnesty. Yeah, and he</br>   got his citizenship from that. His whole family got it, and then he went to</br>   look for my dad when he was eighteen or nineteen and he told him, &quot;Come</br>   with me so you can work and we can actually be a family,&quot; because my dad</br>   had never seen him his whole life and my dad wanted a relationship with him</br>   he said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and he said, &quot;Maybe I can have a better job over there and</br>   stuff,&quot; and my grandfather was like, &quot;Come and I'll support you.&quot; So my dad</br>   came and then later on, the next six months passed and he brought my mom</br>   and then another year passed and then he brought me [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: we hear about Americans exploiting—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound] and now it's Hispanics exploiting Hispanics.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Pause]You didn't speak any English when you went?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you learned English?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Nobody really taught me. I would just go to school and listen to</br>   everybody's voices—I just went into school knowing just basic English, like</br>   &quot;Can I go to the restroom?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; or &quot;I don't understand.&quot;</br>   Those were the three words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of</br>   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How would you describe your English skills now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Fluent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: ____ Arkansas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You went to school. How much schooling did you complete?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Um—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What grade did you complete?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I just finished my high school diploma, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Both my parents.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Anyone else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Never [Negative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Siblings? No?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. I have no siblings.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of US authorities?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your family send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many times a year, more or less?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Every month, so twelve times a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you know about how much, guessing?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Maybe a thousand a month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Sixteen years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sixteen years. So, let's stop for a second. You said you were afraid</br>   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew</br>   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I</br>   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico. They</br>   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because</br>   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had</br>   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities</br>   might come and get my parents.</br> </br> </br>   They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here</br>   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I</br>   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's</br>   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for</br>   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off</br>   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen</br>   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from</br>   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same</br>   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, &quot;Why can't you go</br>   to the hospital?&quot; Or, &quot;Why can't you apply for certain things, government</br>   things?&quot; And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was</br>   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the</br>   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,</br>   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we</br>   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like</br>   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like to live having to keep such a secret?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Pause] I'd be frightened and I mean—I just didn't like that life.</br>   I guess that's why I chose to come back here. But sometimes I question if</br>   coming back here was the best choice or not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: let’s pause the survey and talk—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I guess it’s because ... it's not home and people have a different</br>   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many</br>   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew</br>   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the</br>   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more</br>   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church</br>   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, you said “back home.” “Back home” for you is the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You consider the US your home?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I consider it home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does home mean to you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means</br>   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's</br>   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel</br>   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my</br>   whole life.</br> </br> </br>   But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is seventy-five</br>   percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being Hispanic</br>   or always the question would be, &quot;Are you legal or are you illegal?&quot; And I</br>   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society</br>   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, &quot;What's home?&quot;</br>   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I</br>   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in Arkansas because I</br>   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back</br>   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow US news when you were in the</br>   states?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,</br>   radio, newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped</br>   immigrants. I was there for four years and I helped kids apply for DACA</br>   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because</br>   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go</br>   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, “What if it all</br>   falls down and we're the first ones to get deported?”</br> </br> </br>   So, my parents would be scared and they also…we saw the limitations. You</br>   would have to pay three times the tuition and you couldn't really get a lot</br>   of scholarships. So, there was no way for me to go to college if I would</br>   have to pay so much—even more than what my parents would receive in a year,</br>   because my parents would receive like $20,000 or less a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even if you had gotten—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: DACA, it wouldn't really work for me because I could only work with</br>   that and I couldn't study. And what I wanted to do was study and actually</br>   be able to travel and visit new places and have more opportunities and not</br>   just be stuck in one place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you have studied?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Political science and international relations.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that</br>   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me</br>   it's better if you go to Mexico before you’re eighteen—I mean after you're</br>   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days—I mean</br>   you have to not exceed 180 days—so you can be able to apply and not have</br>   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.</br> </br> </br>   My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to</br>   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from</br>   the States.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I</br>   want to stay here [in the US],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the</br>   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,</br>   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because</br>   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to</br>   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --</br>   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart</br>   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to</br>   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't</br>   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I</br>   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of</br>   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New</br>   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City—it's like thirty-six hours.</br> </br> </br>   And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours</br>   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four</br>   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.</br> </br> </br>   I chose one in Vancouver—Douglas College first, and I got a full</br>   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,</br>   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago—to Mexico City. The</br>   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out</br>   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can</br>   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great</br>   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant</br>   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian</br>   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and</br>   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.</br> </br> </br>   I just felt more at home there than even Mexico, because here I still get</br>   discriminated against for not speaking my language well. And I get</br>   discriminated against because they're like, &quot;Well, you're still Hispanic.</br>   You're not anything more. You're not special or you're not more than us</br>   just because you lived in the US.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you're going to Douglas --?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Douglas College.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is in Vancouver?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Vancouver.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where else did you apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: York University and Winnipeg University and I also applied to the</br>   University of Ottawa, where I also got in. But since Douglas University</br>   gave me a full scholarship for two years, I said I'll choose that one, and</br>   those [the other colleges] were partial scholarships.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I really loved York, but my mom said, &quot;Well just go wherever the</br>   money is at, where the full scholarship is at.&quot; And I went and I loved it.</br>   I really loved it and it felt more like…well not like Arkansas, but similar</br>   to the culture back in the US, so I liked that. I just don't feel</br>   identified in either place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, wait a minute, we have a lot to fill in [survey</br>   questions]. You followed the news, you said through TV and newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which newspapers do you read?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: The Hispanic ones like La Opinión or Latino Times, [Pause] Since my</br>   coalition would partner up with them and give them all the information,</br>   because my coalition would go talk to senators, the governor, and everyone</br>   else, and we also went to New Orleans and Arizona to fight for people's</br>   rights, and even to Washington DC.</br> </br> </br>   I would volunteer more than …in the summer, I would do more than over two</br>   hundred hours. I would work full time there without pay. I just really</br>   loved that work because I knew the struggle and I knew that almost all the</br>   kids in my school who were Latino and were about to graduate could not have</br>   the opportunity to go to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you basically think that DACA or the DREAMers don't work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. Yes. I think you really don't get an advantage from it because</br>   you might be able to work, have a driver's license, have an ID, but they'll</br>   overcharge you for college. An immigrant will never be able to get the</br>   amount of money [for college that they need], especially if they're</br>   illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican news?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never followed Mexican news.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So [reading the survey questions] you qualified for DACA but you</br>   didn't apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was risky.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: and you made the decision to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I remember leaving and my dad calling me when I was in the waiting</br>   room for the flight. He said, &quot;You know what? Just turn around and come</br>   back. We'll fix it. We'll find something. [Starts crying] we'll find you a</br>   job and we might be able to pay for college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   But I said, &quot;No. I have to go.&quot; [Cries] I’m sorry. So I left and I came</br>   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.</br>   She's like, &quot;Do you see me?&quot; But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not</br>   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, &quot;Where are</br>   you? I can't find you,&quot; and she said, &quot;I don't see you either.&quot; She was</br>   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, &quot;Oh.&quot; And she's like,</br>   &quot;I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.”</br> </br> </br>   I met her and it's just ... I didn't really feel a connection there because</br>   I never really talked to her. I don't think I ever spoke to her once in my</br>   life. I know I spoke to my mom's parents and her grandparents because they</br>   came to visit us, but it wasn't ... they would visit and stay for a week or</br>   two, but I really never felt anything because it'd be like, oh, they're</br>   your grandparents, but you never had much time to spend with them or have</br>   experiences with them, if it's such a limited time they're with you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative sound]. Are you living with that grandmother now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And ... I'm just going to go through this [the survey] okay? So how</br>   long have you been back, a month?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I do live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live with your grandparents, right?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you become aware of programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, like New Comienzos. My mom always told me before I would come,</br>   &quot;You should be a part of New Comienzos. I found out about it on the</br>   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think</br>   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and</br>   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is</br>   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]. And they told me that I</br>   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican</br>   history—not even the National Anthem.</br> </br> </br>   And I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll study again, one or two years of high school</br>   since I don't have certain classes that they require, and I have to take</br>   their admission test as well.” I [told myself], &quot; I feel like that would</br>   have been a waste of my time when everybody my age is already starting to</br>   go to college.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, I might be able to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   My aunt [also] told me, &quot;If you want a job you can work with me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I soon realized that jobs here aren't like jobs back home. Jobs here are</br>   very… they pay you very little. They pay you what my mom or my dad would</br>   get in like two days. I would get 6,500 pesos for a whole month, and I</br>   would start at eight in the morning. I only worked there for five days, or</br>   I'll just say a week.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was in a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: In a call center -- from seven in the morning to six in the</br>   afternoon.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Six thousand pesos per what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: 6,500 pesos per month, and they give you commissions. But they</br>   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really</br>   beneficial to work there.</br> </br> </br>   And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know</br>   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be</br>   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they</br>   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my</br>   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of</br>   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high</br>   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were</br>   their slave.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's the same in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes with illegals. Exactly the same, because I would remember my</br>   dad going to work for two or three weeks and him asking for his pay and</br>   never getting paid because they would be like, &quot;I know where you live, I</br>   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and</br>   Customs Enforcement] right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and</br>   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;</br>   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in</br>   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter</br>   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.</br>   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes</br>   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—half</br>   of the minimum wage or less.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And sometimes they wouldn't pay him, you said, at all because -</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, at all, because they told him, &quot;Well, you're illegal. We</br>   don't have to pay you, so bye&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job is your aunt's?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My aunt's is at a call center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, it's a call center. Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful</br>   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the</br>   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she</br>   told me that there have never been cartels there until two years ago [when]</br>   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're</br>   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if</br>   they're not home by a certain hour, they'll kill them, and they do. And</br>   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,</br>   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have</br>   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --</br>   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of</br>   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think Mexico</br>   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Have you been the victim of a crime?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel vulnerable as a returning migrant, as somebody who lived</br>   in the states and come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So would you say it's been difficult to come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm going to read you some things[from the survey] and you'll just</br>   tell me whether: ... finding a job, has that been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been very difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Other economic challenges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're</br>   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like</br>   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel</br>   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --</br>   I'd be like, &quot;Why do Hispanics all live together? Like grandparents, kids,</br>   grandkids?” But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's</br>   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which</br>   is like three hundred dollars a month, you really can't afford anything,</br>   and when the houses here are over three to six million pesos, which is like</br>   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about continuing your education?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Family separation? Is that difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been hard because my parents are the only people I've known my</br>   whole life and they're my rocks, the people I go to for everything. So</br>   having them so distant has been really tough on me [Emotional]. I feel like</br>   I can't talk to my own grandparents because I don't have that trust and</br>   sometimes I just don't feel like there will ever be a connection since I've</br>   lost so many years of my life that I should have lived with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Has it been hard to find friends and make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, very hard, because they think that you're stuck-up, or [ask]</br>   &quot;Why do you have different ways of thinking?&quot; Or they just think bad of</br>   you, just because you're not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are the different ways of thinking that you've noticed between</br>   you and the people you meet here?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Whenever I say I would like to be independent. I told my</br>   grandparents, &quot;You know what, I'm really thankful for my stay here, but I</br>   would like to grow independent.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   In Arkansas, everybody leaves at 18. They go to study and they really never</br>   go back. And I told my grandparents, &quot;Well that's how things happen back</br>   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.” And</br>   they said, &quot;Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until</br>   you're married.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,</br>   &quot;You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with</br>   God, then you don't know what family is.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well I think there</br>   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,</br>   because it's two different things. You can't mix things like that</br>   together.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about language? Has that been hard?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. When I first came here, I didn't understand almost anything</br>   they told me. Like I said, when I was learning English, I would just learn</br>   it by ear, and right now I'm learning [Spanish] by ear, but I still</br>   struggle sometimes to understand what they're trying to tell me. I tell</br>   them to say it maybe three or four times to me because I really don't</br>   understand.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. It's really tough.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you faced discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, so many.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you been depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Recently, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Any substance abuse or addiction?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you still have family living in the US, your parents. Anybody</br>   else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, I consider them my only family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are they US citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. When I called my parents, they were like, &quot;Do you recommend</br>   [coming back]?&quot; My dad's been gone for twenty years. He's like, &quot;Maybe</br>   because we've been gone for that long, maybe things have changed,</br>   especially with the new president.&quot; But I said, &quot;No. Nothing has changed,</br>   and I don't even know how it was back then, but it's horrible now. So I</br>   think you should just stay.” [Sometimes] my dad tells me over the phone,</br>   &quot;I've been gone for so long -- since I was nineteen -- that I feel like if</br>   I go back, I won't even feel like it's my home.” He's just so used to the</br>   culture there -- that's what he grew up with in his adult years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So are they considering coming to live in Mexico then, your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No. Do you currently follow what's going on in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How? Social media, TV, radio, newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and my friends call me. They always call me,</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I want to ask you one more question. Something that we're working on</br>   is… what the US is losing and what Mexico could gain because of people</br>   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation. What do you think</br>   the US loses by losing people like you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, they're losing their own people -- people like me and</br>   thousands and millions of others that never really knew their country and</br>   grew up in the US and consider that their country. I would've given</br>   everything for it because I feel like that's my home.</br> </br> </br>   They're losing all our knowledge, what we could have studied and also given</br>   back to our communities and country: new research, work, new ways of</br>   thinking, new technology, and a lot of things that they could have had, but</br>   don't, [because] we can't.</br> </br> </br>   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no</br>   opportunity, no way out, because they put so many barriers here, like</br>   telling me that I can't go to college because—well, I understand it -- but</br>   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they</br>   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees</br>   can't and why Japanese people or white people from England or Britain can</br>   come and go directly in without knowing any history or almost minimum</br>   Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what would you tell Mexicans that they're gaining by having you</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They're gaining a new way of thinking and lifestyle and new ideas</br>   so we can grow our economy and our country can be better now, since we are</br>   bringing in all these new ideas and ways of thinking and culture.</br> </br> </br>   We can also implement new jobs in [new] ways for our own citizens to live</br>   so we can have a first world, not a third world anymore.</br> </br> </br>   It's really tough living like this and it's really tough living here with</br>   fear. My grandparents are living in fear with all the cartels and</br>   everything in the government. If things happen, you can't even rely on</br>   police, or you can't even rely on a single ambulance. Recently my</br>   grandfather had a stroke and the ambulance came an hour later so we had to</br>   get the taxi. Things like that, simple things like that. The government is</br>   never on time and they are always corrupt and you always have to pay them</br>   off and they never do their job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you bring values to Mexico that you think would be good for</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I bring values like being genuine and straight up with people and</br>   not cheating and going the easy way and working it through. Because</br>   honestly here I see that there's so much cheating and saying so many lies</br>   just to get into positions of power and not even having to study or</br>   anything. There are a lot of people I've known and my grandparents have</br>   known who tell me, &quot;Oh yeah, he's a doctor, but he didn't even study to be</br>   a doctor. He just bought his certificate somewhere.&quot; And you're like, &quot;How</br>   are they working there?&quot; And they could all be like almost killing a</br>   patient and they would be fine with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you a good student in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I got accepted into many colleges there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What colleges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, University of Arkansas, UALR [University of Arkansas at</br>   Little Rock], University of Fayetteville, University of Southern Illinois.</br>   Yeah, I got in there.... UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago] into. I</br>   got into Louisiana State and Baylor.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My GPA was a 4.0.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah. It was really high because my parents always told me, &quot;Since</br>   you're illegal, you will never have opportunities here. So if you want to</br>   make it, even in your own country, you have to have a high standard.&quot; I had</br>   over 500 hours of community service, because I said, &quot;Well, maybe I won't</br>   get citizenship, but maybe by my merits I might.&quot; I would have so many</br>   hours. I would dedicate myself to school, go to tutoring every afternoon,</br>   dedicate myself to doing my homework and studying and being on top of</br>   everything, but no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were your favorite subjects?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: History and literature, or composition.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And history, which history? History of what do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: World history, starting from Mesopotamia to Rome and Greece,</br>   everything. I just like knowing everything from the bottom and where it</br>   came from because [history] repeats itself.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I have one more reflection question. Some women who we have spoken</br>   to who, like you, were undocumented in the States end up in trouble. Some</br>   become young mothers as teenagers, some join gangs. If somebody asked you,</br>   &quot;Why does this happen?&quot; what would you say?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I would say that a lot of Latinas, especially young Latinas have</br>   kids or [join] gangs. Latinos have that mentality that you have to get</br>   married very young and that women are just used for recreation, having a</br>   family -- not for anything else because we have that type of … it's a man's</br>   world here. It's not a woman's world. So if things back home were kind of</br>   tough for women, here it's a million times worse, because we're really</br>   oppressed and we still have rights, but you still aren't respected as a</br>   woman, and so many women just go the easy way, saying, &quot;Well I'll get</br>   pregnant early and finish it off and just live the rest of my life with my</br>   kids and dedicate myself to them,&quot; or some women don't want to do that and</br>   they just say, &quot;Well, I want money and I know I don't have opportunities</br>   because of the economy and all of the things that are happening in my</br>   background, so I guess I'll just join a gang and do all these things so I</br>   can have easy money and opportunities for other things.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why didn't you follow that path?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="602bfe07-7eb2-4bda-8aa3-f4d6d414a81a" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Melani: Because I have ambition for my career, and I've always really<br>
   wanted this career. It's the same career my dad wanted. He wanted to be a<br>

 <br>
   I just want to make a change. I want it to be better. I feel like the only<br>

   In Arkansas, everybody leaves at 18. They go to study and they really never<br>
   go back. And I told my grandparents, &quot;Well that's how things happen back<br>
   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.” And<br>
   they said, &quot;Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until<br>
   you're married.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,<br>
   &quot;You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with<br>
   God, then you don't know what family is.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well I think there<br>
   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,<br>
   because it's two different things. You can't mix things like that<br>
   together.”<br>

   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;<br>
   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in<br>
   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter<br>
   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.<br>
   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes<br>
   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—half<br>
   of the minimum wage or less.<br>

   dad going to work for two or three weeks and him asking for his pay and<br>

   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and<br>

   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really<br>
   beneficial to work there.<br>

 <br>
   And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know<br>
   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be<br>
   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they<br>
   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my<br>
   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of<br>
   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high<br>
   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were<br>

He</br>   was 19 when he left.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was horrible because my grandfather had three restaurants and</br>   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad. In</br>   Arkansas at that time it was seven dollars an hour and he would give my dad</br>   three dollars an hour [Pause] in his restaurant, and my dad figured out</br>   that he would only employ illegals, and especially Native Americans that</br>   didn't speak Spanish—that they spoke dialects so they wouldn't understand</br>   what was going on—and since they didn't know anything because it was a new</br>   country to them, he could exploit them and never report taxes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your grandfather who was originally from Mexico…</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and he came before 1983, which was the amnesty. Yeah, and he</br>   got his citizenship from that. His whole family got it, and then he went to</br>   look for my dad when he was eighteen or nineteen and he told him, &quot;Come</br>   with me so you can work and we can actually be a family,&quot; because my dad</br>   had never seen him his whole life and my dad wanted a relationship with him</br>   he said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and he said, &quot;Maybe I can have a better job over there and</br>   stuff,&quot; and my grandfather was like, &quot;Come and I'll support you.&quot; So my dad</br>   came and then later on, the next six months passed and he brought my mom</br>   and then another year passed and then he brought me [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: we hear about Americans exploiting—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound] and now it's Hispanics exploiting Hispanics.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Pause]You didn't speak any English when you went?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you learned English?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you learn English?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Nobody really taught me. I would just go to school and listen to</br>   everybody's voices—I just went into school knowing just basic English, like</br>   &quot;Can I go to the restroom?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; or &quot;I don't understand.&quot;</br>   Those were the three words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of</br>   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How would you describe your English skills now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Fluent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: ____ Arkansas.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You went to school. How much schooling did you complete?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Um—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What grade did you complete?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I just finished my high school diploma, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you were in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Both my parents.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Anyone else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Never [Negative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Siblings? No?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. I have no siblings.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of US authorities?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did your family send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How many times a year, more or less?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Every month, so twelve times a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you know about how much, guessing?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Maybe a thousand a month.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long did you live in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Sixteen years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sixteen years. So, let's stop for a second. You said you were afraid</br>   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew</br>   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I</br>   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico. They</br>   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because</br>   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had</br>   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities</br>   might come and get my parents.</br> </br> </br>   They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here</br>   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I</br>   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's</br>   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for</br>   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off</br>   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen</br>   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from</br>   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same</br>   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, &quot;Why can't you go</br>   to the hospital?&quot; Or, &quot;Why can't you apply for certain things, government</br>   things?&quot; And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was</br>   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the</br>   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,</br>   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we</br>   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like</br>   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like to live having to keep such a secret?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Pause] I'd be frightened and I mean—I just didn't like that life.</br>   I guess that's why I chose to come back here. But sometimes I question if</br>   coming back here was the best choice or not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: let’s pause the survey and talk—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I guess it’s because ... it's not home and people have a different</br>   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many</br>   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew</br>   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the</br>   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more</br>   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church</br>   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, you said “back home.” “Back home” for you is the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You consider the US your home?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I consider it home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does home mean to you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means</br>   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's</br>   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel</br>   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my</br>   whole life.</br> </br> </br>   But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is seventy-five</br>   percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being Hispanic</br>   or always the question would be, &quot;Are you legal or are you illegal?&quot; And I</br>   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society</br>   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, &quot;What's home?&quot;</br>   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I</br>   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in Arkansas because I</br>   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back</br>   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow US news when you were in the</br>   states?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,</br>   radio, newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped</br>   immigrants. I was there for four years and I helped kids apply for DACA</br>   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because</br>   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go</br>   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, “What if it all</br>   falls down and we're the first ones to get deported?”</br> </br> </br>   So, my parents would be scared and they also…we saw the limitations. You</br>   would have to pay three times the tuition and you couldn't really get a lot</br>   of scholarships. So, there was no way for me to go to college if I would</br>   have to pay so much—even more than what my parents would receive in a year,</br>   because my parents would receive like $20,000 or less a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even if you had gotten—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: DACA, it wouldn't really work for me because I could only work with</br>   that and I couldn't study. And what I wanted to do was study and actually</br>   be able to travel and visit new places and have more opportunities and not</br>   just be stuck in one place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you have studied?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Political science and international relations.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that</br>   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me</br>   it's better if you go to Mexico before you’re eighteen—I mean after you're</br>   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days—I mean</br>   you have to not exceed 180 days—so you can be able to apply and not have</br>   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.</br> </br> </br>   My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to</br>   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from</br>   the States.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I</br>   want to stay here [in the US],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the</br>   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,</br>   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because</br>   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to</br>   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --</br>   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart</br>   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to</br>   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't</br>   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I</br>   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of</br>   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New</br>   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City—it's like thirty-six hours.</br> </br> </br>   And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours</br>   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four</br>   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.</br> </br> </br>   I chose one in Vancouver—Douglas College first, and I got a full</br>   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,</br>   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago—to Mexico City. The</br>   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out</br>   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can</br>   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great</br>   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant</br>   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian</br>   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and</br>   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.</br> </br> </br>   I just felt more at home there than even Mexico, because here I still get</br>   discriminated against for not speaking my language well. And I get</br>   discriminated against because they're like, &quot;Well, you're still Hispanic.</br>   You're not anything more. You're not special or you're not more than us</br>   just because you lived in the US.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you're going to Douglas --?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Douglas College.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is in Vancouver?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Vancouver.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where else did you apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: York University and Winnipeg University and I also applied to the</br>   University of Ottawa, where I also got in. But since Douglas University</br>   gave me a full scholarship for two years, I said I'll choose that one, and</br>   those [the other colleges] were partial scholarships.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I really loved York, but my mom said, &quot;Well just go wherever the</br>   money is at, where the full scholarship is at.&quot; And I went and I loved it.</br>   I really loved it and it felt more like…well not like Arkansas, but similar</br>   to the culture back in the US, so I liked that. I just don't feel</br>   identified in either place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, wait a minute, we have a lot to fill in [survey</br>   questions]. You followed the news, you said through TV and newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which newspapers do you read?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: The Hispanic ones like La Opinión or Latino Times, [Pause] Since my</br>   coalition would partner up with them and give them all the information,</br>   because my coalition would go talk to senators, the governor, and everyone</br>   else, and we also went to New Orleans and Arizona to fight for people's</br>   rights, and even to Washington DC.</br> </br> </br>   I would volunteer more than …in the summer, I would do more than over two</br>   hundred hours. I would work full time there without pay. I just really</br>   loved that work because I knew the struggle and I knew that almost all the</br>   kids in my school who were Latino and were about to graduate could not have</br>   the opportunity to go to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you basically think that DACA or the DREAMers don't work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. Yes. I think you really don't get an advantage from it because</br>   you might be able to work, have a driver's license, have an ID, but they'll</br>   overcharge you for college. An immigrant will never be able to get the</br>   amount of money [for college that they need], especially if they're</br>   illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican news?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never followed Mexican news.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So [reading the survey questions] you qualified for DACA but you</br>   didn't apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was risky.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: and you made the decision to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I remember leaving and my dad calling me when I was in the waiting</br>   room for the flight. He said, &quot;You know what? Just turn around and come</br>   back. We'll fix it. We'll find something. [Starts crying] we'll find you a</br>   job and we might be able to pay for college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   But I said, &quot;No. I have to go.&quot; [Cries] I’m sorry. So I left and I came</br>   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.</br>   She's like, &quot;Do you see me?&quot; But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not</br>   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, &quot;Where are</br>   you? I can't find you,&quot; and she said, &quot;I don't see you either.&quot; She was</br>   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, &quot;Oh.&quot; And she's like,</br>   &quot;I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.”</br> </br> </br>   I met her and it's just ... I didn't really feel a connection there because</br>   I never really talked to her. I don't think I ever spoke to her once in my</br>   life. I know I spoke to my mom's parents and her grandparents because they</br>   came to visit us, but it wasn't ... they would visit and stay for a week or</br>   two, but I really never felt anything because it'd be like, oh, they're</br>   your grandparents, but you never had much time to spend with them or have</br>   experiences with them, if it's such a limited time they're with you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative sound]. Are you living with that grandmother now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And ... I'm just going to go through this [the survey] okay? So how</br>   long have you been back, a month?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I do live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live with your grandparents, right?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you become aware of programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, like New Comienzos. My mom always told me before I would come,</br>   &quot;You should be a part of New Comienzos. I found out about it on the</br>   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think</br>   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and</br>   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is</br>   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]. And they told me that I</br>   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican</br>   history—not even the National Anthem.</br> </br> </br>   And I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll study again, one or two years of high school</br>   since I don't have certain classes that they require, and I have to take</br>   their admission test as well.” I [told myself], &quot; I feel like that would</br>   have been a waste of my time when everybody my age is already starting to</br>   go to college.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, I might be able to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   My aunt [also] told me, &quot;If you want a job you can work with me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I soon realized that jobs here aren't like jobs back home. Jobs here are</br>   very… they pay you very little. They pay you what my mom or my dad would</br>   get in like two days. I would get 6,500 pesos for a whole month, and I</br>   would start at eight in the morning. I only worked there for five days, or</br>   I'll just say a week.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was in a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: In a call center -- from seven in the morning to six in the</br>   afternoon.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Six thousand pesos per what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: 6,500 pesos per month, and they give you commissions. But they</br>   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really</br>   beneficial to work there.</br> </br> </br>   And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know</br>   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be</br>   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they</br>   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my</br>   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of</br>   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high</br>   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were</br>   their slave.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's the same in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes with illegals. Exactly the same, because I would remember my</br>   dad going to work for two or three weeks and him asking for his pay and</br>   never getting paid because they would be like, &quot;I know where you live, I</br>   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and</br>   Customs Enforcement] right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and</br>   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;</br>   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in</br>   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter</br>   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.</br>   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes</br>   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—half</br>   of the minimum wage or less.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And sometimes they wouldn't pay him, you said, at all because -</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, at all, because they told him, &quot;Well, you're illegal. We</br>   don't have to pay you, so bye&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job is your aunt's?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My aunt's is at a call center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, it's a call center. Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful</br>   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the</br>   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she</br>   told me that there have never been cartels there until two years ago [when]</br>   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're</br>   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if</br>   they're not home by a certain hour, they'll kill them, and they do. And</br>   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,</br>   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have</br>   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --</br>   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of</br>   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think Mexico</br>   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Have you been the victim of a crime?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel vulnerable as a returning migrant, as somebody who lived</br>   in the states and come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So would you say it's been difficult to come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm going to read you some things[from the survey] and you'll just</br>   tell me whether: ... finding a job, has that been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been very difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Other economic challenges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're</br>   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like</br>   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel</br>   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --</br>   I'd be like, &quot;Why do Hispanics all live together? Like grandparents, kids,</br>   grandkids?” But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's</br>   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which</br>   is like three hundred dollars a month, you really can't afford anything,</br>   and when the houses here are over three to six million pesos, which is like</br>   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about continuing your education?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Family separation? Is that difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been hard because my parents are the only people I've known my</br>   whole life and they're my rocks, the people I go to for everything. So</br>   having them so distant has been really tough on me [Emotional]. I feel like</br>   I can't talk to my own grandparents because I don't have that trust and</br>   sometimes I just don't feel like there will ever be a connection since I've</br>   lost so many years of my life that I should have lived with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Has it been hard to find friends and make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, very hard, because they think that you're stuck-up, or [ask]</br>   &quot;Why do you have different ways of thinking?&quot; Or they just think bad of</br>   you, just because you're not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are the different ways of thinking that you've noticed between</br>   you and the people you meet here?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Whenever I say I would like to be independent. I told my</br>   grandparents, &quot;You know what, I'm really thankful for my stay here, but I</br>   would like to grow independent.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   In Arkansas, everybody leaves at 18. They go to study and they really never</br>   go back. And I told my grandparents, &quot;Well that's how things happen back</br>   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.” And</br>   they said, &quot;Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until</br>   you're married.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,</br>   &quot;You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with</br>   God, then you don't know what family is.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well I think there</br>   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,</br>   because it's two different things. You can't mix things like that</br>   together.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about language? Has that been hard?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. When I first came here, I didn't understand almost anything</br>   they told me. Like I said, when I was learning English, I would just learn</br>   it by ear, and right now I'm learning [Spanish] by ear, but I still</br>   struggle sometimes to understand what they're trying to tell me. I tell</br>   them to say it maybe three or four times to me because I really don't</br>   understand.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. It's really tough.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you faced discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, so many.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you been depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Recently, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Any substance abuse or addiction?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you still have family living in the US, your parents. Anybody</br>   else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, I consider them my only family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are they US citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. When I called my parents, they were like, &quot;Do you recommend</br>   [coming back]?&quot; My dad's been gone for twenty years. He's like, &quot;Maybe</br>   because we've been gone for that long, maybe things have changed,</br>   especially with the new president.&quot; But I said, &quot;No. Nothing has changed,</br>   and I don't even know how it was back then, but it's horrible now. So I</br>   think you should just stay.” [Sometimes] my dad tells me over the phone,</br>   &quot;I've been gone for so long -- since I was nineteen -- that I feel like if</br>   I go back, I won't even feel like it's my home.” He's just so used to the</br>   culture there -- that's what he grew up with in his adult years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So are they considering coming to live in Mexico then, your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No. Do you currently follow what's going on in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How? Social media, TV, radio, newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and my friends call me. They always call me,</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I want to ask you one more question. Something that we're working on</br>   is… what the US is losing and what Mexico could gain because of people</br>   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation. What do you think</br>   the US loses by losing people like you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, they're losing their own people -- people like me and</br>   thousands and millions of others that never really knew their country and</br>   grew up in the US and consider that their country. I would've given</br>   everything for it because I feel like that's my home.</br> </br> </br>   They're losing all our knowledge, what we could have studied and also given</br>   back to our communities and country: new research, work, new ways of</br>   thinking, new technology, and a lot of things that they could have had, but</br>   don't, [because] we can't.</br> </br> </br>   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no</br>   opportunity, no way out, because they put so many barriers here, like</br>   telling me that I can't go to college because—well, I understand it -- but</br>   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they</br>   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees</br>   can't and why Japanese people or white people from England or Britain can</br>   come and go directly in without knowing any history or almost minimum</br>   Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what would you tell Mexicans that they're gaining by having you</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They're gaining a new way of thinking and lifestyle and new ideas</br>   so we can grow our economy and our country can be better now, since we are</br>   bringing in all these new ideas and ways of thinking and culture.</br> </br> </br>   We can also implement new jobs in [new] ways for our own citizens to live</br>   so we can have a first world, not a third world anymore.</br> </br> </br>   It's really tough living like this and it's really tough living here with</br>   fear. My grandparents are living in fear with all the cartels and</br>   everything in the government. If things happen, you can't even rely on</br>   police, or you can't even rely on a single ambulance. Recently my</br>   grandfather had a stroke and the ambulance came an hour later so we had to</br>   get the taxi. Things like that, simple things like that. The government is</br>   never on time and they are always corrupt and you always have to pay them</br>   off and they never do their job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you bring values to Mexico that you think would be good for</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I bring values like being genuine and straight up with people and</br>   not cheating and going the easy way and working it through. Because</br>   honestly here I see that there's so much cheating and saying so many lies</br>   just to get into positions of power and not even having to study or</br>   anything. There are a lot of people I've known and my grandparents have</br>   known who tell me, &quot;Oh yeah, he's a doctor, but he didn't even study to be</br>   a doctor. He just bought his certificate somewhere.&quot; And you're like, &quot;How</br>   are they working there?&quot; And they could all be like almost killing a</br>   patient and they would be fine with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you a good student in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I got accepted into many colleges there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What colleges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, University of Arkansas, UALR [University of Arkansas at</br>   Little Rock], University of Fayetteville, University of Southern Illinois.</br>   Yeah, I got in there.... UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago] into. I</br>   got into Louisiana State and Baylor.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My GPA was a 4.0.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah. It was really high because my parents always told me, &quot;Since</br>   you're illegal, you will never have opportunities here. So if you want to</br>   make it, even in your own country, you have to have a high standard.&quot; I had</br>   over 500 hours of community service, because I said, &quot;Well, maybe I won't</br>   get citizenship, but maybe by my merits I might.&quot; I would have so many</br>   hours. I would dedicate myself to school, go to tutoring every afternoon,</br>   dedicate myself to doing my homework and studying and being on top of</br>   everything, but no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were your favorite subjects?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: History and literature, or composition.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And history, which history? History of what do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: World history, starting from Mesopotamia to Rome and Greece,</br>   everything. I just like knowing everything from the bottom and where it</br>   came from because [history] repeats itself.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="cc3d63a3-734e-48af-b472-8b44963ce43a" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Gangs">Anita: I have one more reflection question. Some women who we have spoken<br>
   to who, like you, were undocumented in the States end up in trouble. Some<br>
   become young mothers as teenagers, some join gangs. If somebody asked you,<br>
   &quot;Why does this happen?&quot; what would you say?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: I would say that a lot of Latinas, especially young Latinas have<br>
   kids or [join] gangs. Latinos have that mentality that you have to get<br>
   married very young and that women are just used for recreation, having a<br>
   family -- not for anything else because we have that type of … it's a man's<br>
   world here. It's not a woman's world. So if things back home were kind of<br>
   tough for women, here it's a million times worse, because we're really<br>
   oppressed and we still have rights, but you still aren't respected as a<br>
   woman, and so many women just go the easy way, saying, &quot;Well I'll get<br>
   pregnant early and finish it off and just live the rest of my life with my<br>
   kids and dedicate myself to them,&quot; or some women don't want to do that and<br>
   they just say, &quot;Well, I want money and I know I don't have opportunities<br>
   because of the economy and all of the things that are happening in my<br>
   background, so I guess I'll just join a gang and do all these things so I<br>
   can have easy money and opportunities for other things.&quot;<br>

   don't, [because] we can't.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no<br>

   telling me that I can't go to college because—well, I understand it -- but<br>
   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they<br>
   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees<br>

   Melani: Yes. My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're<br>
   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like<br>
   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel<br>
   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --<br>
   I'd be like, &quot;Why do Hispanics all live together? Like grandparents, kids,<br>
   grandkids?” But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's<br>
   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which<br>
   is like three hundred dollars a month, you really can't afford anything,<br>
   and when the houses here are over three to six million pesos, which is like<br>
   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful<br>
   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the<br>
   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she<br>
   told me that there have never been cartels there until two years ago [when]<br>
   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're<br>
   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if<br>
   they're not home by a certain hour, they'll kill them, and they do. And<br>
   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,<br>
   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have<br>
   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --<br>
   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of<br>
   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think Mexico<br>
   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Yes, like New Comienzos. My mom always told me before I would come,<br>
   &quot;You should be a part of New Comienzos. I found out about it on the<br>
   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think<br>
   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and<br>
   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is<br>
   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]. And they told me that I<br>
   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican<br>
   history—not even the National Anthem.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="b98dcdcd-d737-4ce4-a966-79420211eac3" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Education, DACA, College">Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that<br>
   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me<br>
   it's better if you go to Mexico before you’re eighteen—I mean after you're<br>
   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days—I mean<br>
   you have to not exceed 180 days—so you can be able to apply and not have<br>
   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to<br>
   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from<br>
   the States.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I<br>
   want to stay here [in the US],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the<br>
   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,<br>
   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because<br>
   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to<br>
   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --<br>
   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart<br>
   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to<br>
   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't<br>
   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I<br>
   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of<br>
   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New<br>
   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City—it's like thirty-six hours.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours<br>
   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four<br>
   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   I chose one in Vancouver—Douglas College first, and I got a full<br>
   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,<br>
   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago—to Mexico City. The<br>
   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out<br>
   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can<br>
   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great<br>
   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant<br>
   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian<br>
   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and<br>
   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.<br>

   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society<br>

   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew<br>

   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church<br>
   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].<br>

   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew<br>
   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I<br>
   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico. They<br>
   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because<br>
   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had<br>
   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities<br>
   might come and get my parents.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here<br>
   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I<br>
   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's<br>
   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for<br>
   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off<br>
   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen<br>
   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than<br>
   them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from<br>
   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same<br>
   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, &quot;Why can't you go<br>
   to the hospital?&quot; Or, &quot;Why can't you apply for certain things, government<br>
   things?&quot; And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was<br>
   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the<br>
   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,<br>
   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we<br>
   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like<br>
   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].<br>

 <br>
   Anita: How did you learn English?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Nobody really taught me. I would just go to school and listen to<br>
   everybody's voices—I just went into school knowing just basic English, like<br>
   &quot;Can I go to the restroom?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; or &quot;I don't understand.&quot;<br>
   Those were the three words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of<br>
   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How would you describe your English skills now?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Fluent.<br>

   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad. In<br>
   Arkansas at that time it was seven dollars an hour and he would give my dad<br>
   three dollars an hour [Pause] in his restaurant, and my dad figured out<br>
   that he would only employ illegals, and especially Native Americans that<br>
   didn't speak Spanish—that they spoke dialects so they wouldn't understand<br>
   what was going on—and since they didn't know anything because it was a new<br>
   country to them, he could exploit them and never report taxes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Your grandfather who was originally from Mexico…<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Yes, and he came before 1983, which was the amnesty. Yeah, and he<br>
   got his citizenship from that. His whole family got it, and then he went to<br>
   look for my dad when he was eighteen or nineteen and he told him, &quot;Come<br>
   with me so you can work and we can actually be a family,&quot; because my dad<br>
   had never seen him his whole life and my dad wanted a relationship with him<br>
   he said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and he said, &quot;Maybe I can have a better job over there and<br>
   stuff,&quot; and my grandfather was like, &quot;Come and I'll support you.&quot; So my dad<br>
   came and then later on, the next six months passed and he brought my mom<br>
   and then another year passed and then he brought me [Affirmative sound].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: we hear about Americans exploiting—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: [Affirmative sound] and now it's Hispanics exploiting Hispanics.<br>

   just cross the border?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Both my parents had work permits and they paid a coyote to cross<br>
   me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: I crossed through with a car in the desert. Well they had a contact<br>
   that they had a kid that was around my age and they made me go through as a<br>
   boy. And so—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Really?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Yes. As someone else's child. I got dressed up as a boy so I could<br>
   cross the border with this other person, and my parents told me that I was<br>
   supposed to be in San Antonio at seven at night because that's what the<br>
   coyote told my parents, and they didn't find me until four in the morning.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Oh my God.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Yeah, so my parents thought I was already sold to the organ trade<br>
   or something. My mom was scared and then she found the coyote but they had<br>
   issues crossing and everything.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: It was a pretty scary experience?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: It was pretty [Affirmative sound]—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Before they dressed you like a boy, did you have long hair?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: Yes I did [Affirmative sound], but they cut it all off so I could<br>
   cross with them [Affirmative sound].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You were two?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: I was two. I don't remember anything. They made me go as someone<br>
   else's child [Affirmative sound].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did your parents tell you what happened? How did you get lost? Do<br>
   they know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Melani: They said that the coyote told them that he was going to call them<br>
   at seven as soon as they got there, but they never called them and they<br>
   didn't know where to look because they had no other contact with him<br>
   whatsoever. Until later on that night, they said that they got a call from<br>
   him at four in the morning and my mom was already scared, but they couldn't<br>
   go to any authority because it was something illegal to do. So they just<br>
   picked me up and they just paid him off and then it was over.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, my grandfather was a US citizen, but we never got anything from</br>   him because it was the first time my dad had ever met him and he didn't</br>   want to receive any of his help because he would charge him later on.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because he would what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: He would like…if he received anything from his dad, he would later</br>   on tell him that everything he had is because of him. He’d be in debt</br>   forever.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So it wasn't a great reunion?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Negative sound] no, my dad had never met him in all his life.

So, let's stop for a second. You said you were afraid</br>   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I was afraid because from a young age—well, I really never knew</br>   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I</br>   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico. They</br>   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because</br>   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had</br>   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities</br>   might come and get my parents.</br> </br> </br>   They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here</br>   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I</br>   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's</br>   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for</br>   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off</br>   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen</br>   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from</br>   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same</br>   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, &quot;Why can't you go</br>   to the hospital?&quot; Or, &quot;Why can't you apply for certain things, government</br>   things?&quot; And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was</br>   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the</br>   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,</br>   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we</br>   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like</br>   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was it like to live having to keep such a secret?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Pause] I'd be frightened and I mean—I just didn't like that life.</br>   I guess that's why I chose to come back here. But sometimes I question if</br>   coming back here was the best choice or not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: let’s pause the survey and talk—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I guess it’s because ... it's not home and people have a different</br>   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many</br>   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew</br>   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the</br>   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more</br>   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church</br>   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, you said “back home.” “Back home” for you is the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You consider the US your home?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I consider it home.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does home mean to you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means</br>   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's</br>   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel</br>   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my</br>   whole life.</br> </br> </br>   But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is seventy-five</br>   percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being Hispanic</br>   or always the question would be, &quot;Are you legal or are you illegal?&quot; And I</br>   would be like &quot;I'm legal,&quot; but I never felt a part of the society</br>   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, &quot;What's home?&quot;</br>   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I</br>   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in Arkansas because I</br>   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back</br>   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow US news when you were in the</br>   states?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,</br>   radio, newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped</br>   immigrants. I was there for four years and I helped kids apply for DACA</br>   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because</br>   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go</br>   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, “What if it all</br>   falls down and we're the first ones to get deported?”</br> </br> </br>   So, my parents would be scared and they also…we saw the limitations. You</br>   would have to pay three times the tuition and you couldn't really get a lot</br>   of scholarships. So, there was no way for me to go to college if I would</br>   have to pay so much—even more than what my parents would receive in a year,</br>   because my parents would receive like $20,000 or less a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even if you had gotten—</br> </br> </br>   Melani: DACA, it wouldn't really work for me because I could only work with</br>   that and I couldn't study. And what I wanted to do was study and actually</br>   be able to travel and visit new places and have more opportunities and not</br>   just be stuck in one place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you have studied?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Political science and international relations.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that</br>   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me</br>   it's better if you go to Mexico before you’re eighteen—I mean after you're</br>   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days—I mean</br>   you have to not exceed 180 days—so you can be able to apply and not have</br>   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.</br> </br> </br>   My mom would say, &quot; you know what? It's better if you just go back to</br>   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from</br>   the States.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, &quot;I don't want to leave. I</br>   want to stay here [in the US],&quot; because in my heart I felt like the</br>   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,</br>   but my mom said, &quot;You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because</br>   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to</br>   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --</br>   you can come back and visit us,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, you're right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart</br>   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to</br>   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't</br>   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I</br>   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of</br>   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New</br>   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City—it's like thirty-six hours.</br> </br> </br>   And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours</br>   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four</br>   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.</br> </br> </br>   I chose one in Vancouver—Douglas College first, and I got a full</br>   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,</br>   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago—to Mexico City. The</br>   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.</br> </br> </br>   The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out</br>   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can</br>   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great</br>   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant</br>   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian</br>   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and</br>   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.</br> </br> </br>   I just felt more at home there than even Mexico, because here I still get</br>   discriminated against for not speaking my language well. And I get</br>   discriminated against because they're like, &quot;Well, you're still Hispanic.</br>   You're not anything more. You're not special or you're not more than us</br>   just because you lived in the US.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you're going to Douglas --?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Douglas College.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which is in Vancouver?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Vancouver.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where else did you apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: York University and Winnipeg University and I also applied to the</br>   University of Ottawa, where I also got in. But since Douglas University</br>   gave me a full scholarship for two years, I said I'll choose that one, and</br>   those [the other colleges] were partial scholarships.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I really loved York, but my mom said, &quot;Well just go wherever the</br>   money is at, where the full scholarship is at.&quot; And I went and I loved it.</br>   I really loved it and it felt more like…well not like Arkansas, but similar</br>   to the culture back in the US, so I liked that. I just don't feel</br>   identified in either place.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So, wait a minute, we have a lot to fill in [survey</br>   questions]. You followed the news, you said through TV and newspapers?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Which newspapers do you read?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: The Hispanic ones like La Opinión or Latino Times, [Pause] Since my</br>   coalition would partner up with them and give them all the information,</br>   because my coalition would go talk to senators, the governor, and everyone</br>   else, and we also went to New Orleans and Arizona to fight for people's</br>   rights, and even to Washington DC.</br> </br> </br>   I would volunteer more than …in the summer, I would do more than over two</br>   hundred hours. I would work full time there without pay. I just really</br>   loved that work because I knew the struggle and I knew that almost all the</br>   kids in my school who were Latino and were about to graduate could not have</br>   the opportunity to go to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you basically think that DACA or the DREAMers don't work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. Yes. I think you really don't get an advantage from it because</br>   you might be able to work, have a driver's license, have an ID, but they'll</br>   overcharge you for college. An immigrant will never be able to get the</br>   amount of money [for college that they need], especially if they're</br>   illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican news?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I never followed Mexican news.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So [reading the survey questions] you qualified for DACA but you</br>   didn't apply?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Because?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It was risky.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: and you made the decision to leave?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I remember leaving and my dad calling me when I was in the waiting</br>   room for the flight. He said, &quot;You know what? Just turn around and come</br>   back. We'll fix it. We'll find something. [Starts crying] we'll find you a</br>   job and we might be able to pay for college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   But I said, &quot;No. I have to go.&quot; [Cries] I’m sorry. So I left and I came</br>   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.</br>   She's like, &quot;Do you see me?&quot; But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not</br>   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, &quot;Where are</br>   you? I can't find you,&quot; and she said, &quot;I don't see you either.&quot; She was</br>   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, &quot;Oh.&quot; And she's like,</br>   &quot;I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?&quot;</br>   And I was like, &quot;Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.”</br> </br> </br>   I met her and it's just ... I didn't really feel a connection there because</br>   I never really talked to her. I don't think I ever spoke to her once in my</br>   life. I know I spoke to my mom's parents and her grandparents because they</br>   came to visit us, but it wasn't ... they would visit and stay for a week or</br>   two, but I really never felt anything because it'd be like, oh, they're</br>   your grandparents, but you never had much time to spend with them or have</br>   experiences with them, if it's such a limited time they're with you.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative sound]. Are you living with that grandmother now?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And ... I'm just going to go through this [the survey] okay? So how</br>   long have you been back, a month?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I do live in Mexico City.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live with your grandparents, right?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: [Affirmative sound]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you become aware of programs that support returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, like New Comienzos. My mom always told me before I would come,</br>   &quot;You should be a part of New Comienzos. I found out about it on the</br>   internet.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think</br>   anybody could help me.&quot; And I came here and I was looking for a job and</br>   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is</br>   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]. And they told me that I</br>   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican</br>   history—not even the National Anthem.</br> </br> </br>   And I was like, &quot;Okay, I'll study again, one or two years of high school</br>   since I don't have certain classes that they require, and I have to take</br>   their admission test as well.” I [told myself], &quot; I feel like that would</br>   have been a waste of my time when everybody my age is already starting to</br>   go to college.&quot; And I said, &quot;Okay, I might be able to do this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   My aunt [also] told me, &quot;If you want a job you can work with me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   I soon realized that jobs here aren't like jobs back home. Jobs here are</br>   very… they pay you very little. They pay you what my mom or my dad would</br>   get in like two days. I would get 6,500 pesos for a whole month, and I</br>   would start at eight in the morning. I only worked there for five days, or</br>   I'll just say a week.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This was in a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: In a call center -- from seven in the morning to six in the</br>   afternoon.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Six thousand pesos per what?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: 6,500 pesos per month, and they give you commissions. But they</br>   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really</br>   beneficial to work there.</br> </br> </br>   And I said, “Well fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know</br>   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be</br>   with family.” I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they</br>   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my</br>   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of</br>   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high</br>   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were</br>   their slave.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's the same in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes with illegals. Exactly the same, because I would remember my</br>   dad going to work for two or three weeks and him asking for his pay and</br>   never getting paid because they would be like, &quot;I know where you live, I</br>   know what your name is, and I can report you to ICE [Immigration and</br>   Customs Enforcement] right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where did he work?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and</br>   he would always be like, &quot;Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?&quot;</br>   and they would be like, &quot;Yes.&quot; So he would go from one job to another in</br>   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter</br>   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.</br>   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes</br>   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less—half</br>   of the minimum wage or less.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And sometimes they wouldn't pay him, you said, at all because -</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah, at all, because they told him, &quot;Well, you're illegal. We</br>   don't have to pay you, so bye&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What job is your aunt's?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My aunt's is at a call center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh, it's a call center. Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful</br>   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the</br>   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she</br>   told me that there have never been cartels there until two years ago [when]</br>   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're</br>   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if</br>   they're not home by a certain hour, they'll kill them, and they do. And</br>   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,</br>   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have</br>   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --</br>   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of</br>   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think Mexico</br>   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Have you been the victim of a crime?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel vulnerable as a returning migrant, as somebody who lived</br>   in the states and come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So would you say it's been difficult to come back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I'm going to read you some things[from the survey] and you'll just</br>   tell me whether: ... finding a job, has that been difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been very difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Other economic challenges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're</br>   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like</br>   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel</br>   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --</br>   I'd be like, &quot;Why do Hispanics all live together? Like grandparents, kids,</br>   grandkids?” But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's</br>   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which</br>   is like three hundred dollars a month, you really can't afford anything,</br>   and when the houses here are over three to six million pesos, which is like</br>   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about continuing your education?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Family separation? Is that difficult?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: It's been hard because my parents are the only people I've known my</br>   whole life and they're my rocks, the people I go to for everything. So</br>   having them so distant has been really tough on me [Emotional]. I feel like</br>   I can't talk to my own grandparents because I don't have that trust and</br>   sometimes I just don't feel like there will ever be a connection since I've</br>   lost so many years of my life that I should have lived with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Has it been hard to find friends and make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, very hard, because they think that you're stuck-up, or [ask]</br>   &quot;Why do you have different ways of thinking?&quot; Or they just think bad of</br>   you, just because you're not from here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are the different ways of thinking that you've noticed between</br>   you and the people you meet here?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Whenever I say I would like to be independent. I told my</br>   grandparents, &quot;You know what, I'm really thankful for my stay here, but I</br>   would like to grow independent.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   In Arkansas, everybody leaves at 18. They go to study and they really never</br>   go back. And I told my grandparents, &quot;Well that's how things happen back</br>   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.” And</br>   they said, &quot;Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until</br>   you're married.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,</br>   &quot;You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with</br>   God, then you don't know what family is.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Well I think there</br>   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,</br>   because it's two different things. You can't mix things like that</br>   together.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What about language? Has that been hard?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. When I first came here, I didn't understand almost anything</br>   they told me. Like I said, when I was learning English, I would just learn</br>   it by ear, and right now I'm learning [Spanish] by ear, but I still</br>   struggle sometimes to understand what they're trying to tell me. I tell</br>   them to say it maybe three or four times to me because I really don't</br>   understand.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. It's really tough.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you faced discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, so many.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have you been depressed?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Recently, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Any substance abuse or addiction?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you still have family living in the US, your parents. Anybody</br>   else?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No, I consider them my only family.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Are they US citizens?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Have they come to visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No. When I called my parents, they were like, &quot;Do you recommend</br>   [coming back]?&quot; My dad's been gone for twenty years. He's like, &quot;Maybe</br>   because we've been gone for that long, maybe things have changed,</br>   especially with the new president.&quot; But I said, &quot;No. Nothing has changed,</br>   and I don't even know how it was back then, but it's horrible now. So I</br>   think you should just stay.” [Sometimes] my dad tells me over the phone,</br>   &quot;I've been gone for so long -- since I was nineteen -- that I feel like if</br>   I go back, I won't even feel like it's my home.” He's just so used to the</br>   culture there -- that's what he grew up with in his adult years.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So are they considering coming to live in Mexico then, your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No. Do you currently follow what's going on in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How? Social media, TV, radio, newspaper?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, and my friends call me. They always call me,</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I want to ask you one more question. Something that we're working on</br>   is… what the US is losing and what Mexico could gain because of people</br>   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation. What do you think</br>   the US loses by losing people like you?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, they're losing their own people -- people like me and</br>   thousands and millions of others that never really knew their country and</br>   grew up in the US and consider that their country. I would've given</br>   everything for it because I feel like that's my home.</br> </br> </br>   They're losing all our knowledge, what we could have studied and also given</br>   back to our communities and country: new research, work, new ways of</br>   thinking, new technology, and a lot of things that they could have had, but</br>   don't, [because] we can't.</br> </br> </br>   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no</br>   opportunity, no way out, because they put so many barriers here, like</br>   telling me that I can't go to college because—well, I understand it -- but</br>   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they</br>   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees</br>   can't and why Japanese people or white people from England or Britain can</br>   come and go directly in without knowing any history or almost minimum</br>   Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what would you tell Mexicans that they're gaining by having you</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: They're gaining a new way of thinking and lifestyle and new ideas</br>   so we can grow our economy and our country can be better now, since we are</br>   bringing in all these new ideas and ways of thinking and culture.</br> </br> </br>   We can also implement new jobs in [new] ways for our own citizens to live</br>   so we can have a first world, not a third world anymore.</br> </br> </br>   It's really tough living like this and it's really tough living here with</br>   fear. My grandparents are living in fear with all the cartels and</br>   everything in the government. If things happen, you can't even rely on</br>   police, or you can't even rely on a single ambulance. Recently my</br>   grandfather had a stroke and the ambulance came an hour later so we had to</br>   get the taxi. Things like that, simple things like that. The government is</br>   never on time and they are always corrupt and you always have to pay them</br>   off and they never do their job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you bring values to Mexico that you think would be good for</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I bring values like being genuine and straight up with people and</br>   not cheating and going the easy way and working it through. Because</br>   honestly here I see that there's so much cheating and saying so many lies</br>   just to get into positions of power and not even having to study or</br>   anything. There are a lot of people I've known and my grandparents have</br>   known who tell me, &quot;Oh yeah, he's a doctor, but he didn't even study to be</br>   a doctor. He just bought his certificate somewhere.&quot; And you're like, &quot;How</br>   are they working there?&quot; And they could all be like almost killing a</br>   patient and they would be fine with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you a good student in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes, I got accepted into many colleges there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What colleges?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Well, University of Arkansas, UALR [University of Arkansas at</br>   Little Rock], University of Fayetteville, University of Southern Illinois.</br>   Yeah, I got in there.... UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago] into. I</br>   got into Louisiana State and Baylor.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: My GPA was a 4.0.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yeah. It was really high because my parents always told me, &quot;Since</br>   you're illegal, you will never have opportunities here. So if you want to</br>   make it, even in your own country, you have to have a high standard.&quot; I had</br>   over 500 hours of community service, because I said, &quot;Well, maybe I won't</br>   get citizenship, but maybe by my merits I might.&quot; I would have so many</br>   hours. I would dedicate myself to school, go to tutoring every afternoon,</br>   dedicate myself to doing my homework and studying and being on top of</br>   everything, but no.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were your favorite subjects?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: History and literature, or composition.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And history, which history? History of what do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: World history, starting from Mesopotamia to Rome and Greece,</br>   everything. I just like knowing everything from the bottom and where it</br>   came from because [history] repeats itself.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I have one more reflection question. Some women who we have spoken</br>   to who, like you, were undocumented in the States end up in trouble. Some</br>   become young mothers as teenagers, some join gangs. If somebody asked you,</br>   &quot;Why does this happen?&quot; what would you say?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: I would say that a lot of Latinas, especially young Latinas have</br>   kids or [join] gangs. Latinos have that mentality that you have to get</br>   married very young and that women are just used for recreation, having a</br>   family -- not for anything else because we have that type of … it's a man's</br>   world here. It's not a woman's world. So if things back home were kind of</br>   tough for women, here it's a million times worse, because we're really</br>   oppressed and we still have rights, but you still aren't respected as a</br>   woman, and so many women just go the easy way, saying, &quot;Well I'll get</br>   pregnant early and finish it off and just live the rest of my life with my</br>   kids and dedicate myself to them,&quot; or some women don't want to do that and</br>   they just say, &quot;Well, I want money and I know I don't have opportunities</br>   because of the economy and all of the things that are happening in my</br>   background, so I guess I'll just join a gang and do all these things so I</br>   can have easy money and opportunities for other things.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why didn't you follow that path?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Because I have ambition for my career, and I've always really</br>   wanted this career. It's the same career my dad wanted. He wanted to be a</br>   politician, and I really wanted it too, not because of him, but because I</br>   would see how people would live and then I would be like ... in my own</br>   country it's even worse.</br> </br> </br>   I just want to make a change. I want it to be better. I feel like the only</br>   way to make a difference here is not what the president, the new one, is</br>   doing. I feel like you have to get at everything from the root and change.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you talk about, I get confused when you talk about my</br>   country, which country we're talking about.</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you think about in the future, sort of becoming a politician or</br>   doing something, are you talking about making a change here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Melani: Yes. I think I will never go back and live in the US. I would visit</br>   because that's where I feel like I belong, but I feel like I'm needed</br>   elsewhere. And I would really love to have an opportunity to work in the</br>   Senate or the Congress, or work in the consulate of Mexico in another</br>   country.</br> </div><\p>
