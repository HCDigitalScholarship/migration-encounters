Was it your decision?</br>   Were you detained and deported?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: I was detained and deported.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, in one word, how did this happen? Were you detained by the</br>   police? Were you imprisoned? Was there a raid at where you worked? Were you</br>   in the wrong place at the wrong time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: No. Detained with the police.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Was it for a traffic violation, affiliation with gangs, some little</br>   crime or some bigger crime?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: No, it was possession.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Possession of?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Of drugs.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Of drugs?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Is that a misdemeanor?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Yes.

The</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time I was detained for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">almost a year</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: In immigration or in federal?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: In immigration. I was never in federal.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Where was that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Well, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Phoenix</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Arizona</span>, and then the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span></br>   time was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Atlanta</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>. Actually, I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Gwinnett</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Gwinnett County</span>.</br>   And right there I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Jail Dog Program</span>, so I used to sleep with my</br>   dog and everything in my cell.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's a Jail Dog Program?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">The Jail Dog Program</span> is where the police department gets dogs from</br>   the streets and they help them to get a home. So, we had to train them. How</br>   to sit, how to roll, how to do stuff like that, with treats. And then the</br>   dogs, they put them on the news and then they'll have them do tricks and</br>   people will come and adopt the dogs. It's actually—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sort of like a rescue program?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Yeah, it's actually on Facebook. It's called <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Gwinnett Jail Dogs</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay. When you came back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, did any authorities receive you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Yeah, in the border.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Well, they give us some lunch and they took us from the spot that we</br>   landed to the bus stations because it's too dangerous down here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How long have you been back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Almost a year</span>. I've been here since <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">September</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: I live by myself.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you live in an apartment, or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you've worked, what job?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Right there, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">TeleTech</span>. I work for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Dish</span>. I've been working for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six   months</span>, but they have already moved me up like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span>... Well, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   one, it was the customer service, then tech and then right now I'm on level</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you feel safe in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Well, not really. I don't like the environment and the cops, they're</br>   all... No, it's different here. But I mean, I have to stick with it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What are your best memories of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Well, being with my family, being with my kids. That is one of the</br>   best memories I do have.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you like living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Yeah. I did like living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Everything. Everything. Even the air. [Chuckles]. Yeah, everything</br>   was different. It's very different. I honestly don't like it down here. I</br>   mean, I don't like it. But then there's some people, I have some cousins,</br>   they don't like to be there. So, I mean, sometimes we like to joke around,</br>   let's trade spots, you know. Because they like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and I don't like</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. They don't like being in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. But that's because they were</br>   born over there. If they were born over here, they would be the same thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What don't you like about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: I just don't like how some people act you know? Or the cops here too,</br>   like they're dangerous themselves.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How do <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> treat you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: It depends. Some people, they just see that you got good stuff and</br>   they just go ahead and rob you. Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle</br>   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when</br>   you are in the States it's not even like that. Or if it happens, it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span></br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">million</span>, or you know? But not all the time. Like here, I've been robbed</br>   here like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> times already.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, what happened to you in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>? So that you ended up back</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over</br>   and I was just with the people, but they'd said that—well they found drugs</br>   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side. So, I know</br>   that the rules is whoever's driving or the car owner has to be responsible.</br>   But they did not take it like that. They just said... I didn't want to give</br>   them my name because I was scared. So, they took me for that too, giving a</br>   false name. But on top of that they put all the charges on me. So, they</br>   charged me for all the drugs because they didn't want to take the charge.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, they charged you instead of the person who had the drugs?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Yes. Yes, that's true.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why'd they do that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: I don't know, but they did.

What I like about this job is that it makes me feel like at</br>   home, like in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. Once I go in there, I forget about everything.</br>   Just when I do go out the reality hits me and I see that I'm not in the</br>   States, I'm in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>. But I do like to be in there. If I could, I'd</br>   stay in there. Like I do overtime, I like to be talking with the customers,</br>   you know, in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. Yeah. We have a good conversation sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you talk about lots of things about—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Well, we talk about the shows, you know, the programming, what's</br>   available to talk about in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">TeleTech</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And if you would've stayed in the States, what do you think you</br>   would have done with your life?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: I would have still been a painter. I would have probably got my own</br>   company since everybody gets one down there.

I want to stay in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Teletech</span>. I've</br>   been here for so long—well, not so long, but since I started. And so many</br>   people that are being there, they're already gone. So, we started together,</br>   but there's only like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> of us, but I want to stay there. I want to</br>   stick around. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Well, I wish you all the best.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span>: Thank you very much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And I hope your children come and visit you soon.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ivan</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Memories, Family, No hope for a future in the US">my famil</span>y, being with my kids. That is one of the</br>   best memories I do have.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like living in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah. I did like living in the United States. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Everything. Everything. Even the air. [Chuckles]. Yeah, everything</br>   was different. It's very different. I honestly don't like it down here. I</br>   mean, I don't like it. But then there's some people, I have some cousins,</br>   they don't like to be there. So, I mean, sometimes we like to joke around,</br>   let's trade spots, you know. Because they like Mexico and I don't like</br>   Mexico. They don't like being in the States. But that's because they were</br>   born over there. If they were born over here, they would be the same thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What don't you like about Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I just don't like how some people act you know? Or the cops here too,</br>   like they're dangerous themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do Mexicans treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: It depends. Some people, they just see that you got good stuff and</br>   they just go ahead and rob you. Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle</br>   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when</br>   you are in the States it's not even like that. Or if it happens, it's one</br>   in million, or you know? But not all the time. Like here, I've been robbed</br>   here like three times already.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you in the States? So that you ended up back</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over</br>   and I was just with the people, but they'd said that—well they found drugs</br>   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side. So, I know</br>   that the rules is whoever's driving or the car owner has to be responsible.</br>   But they did not take it like that. They just said... I didn't want to give</br>   them my name because I was scared. So, they took me for that too, giving a</br>   false name. But on top of that they put all the charges on me. So, they</br>   charged me for all the drugs because they didn't want to take the charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, they charged you instead of the person who had the drugs?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes. Yes, that's true.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd they do that?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I don't know, but they did. They didn't want to take the charge. But</br>   I mean, I was just with them because I was going to Walmart to do a return</br>   and they stopped us in a traffic stop and they blamed it all on me. I was</br>   trying to fight my case, but it was taking too long. I was getting too</br>   stressed out being inside in jail so I just signed the papers.

Was it your decision?</br>   Were you detained and deported?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I was detained and deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, in one word, how did this happen? Were you detained by the</br>   police? Were you imprisoned? Was there a raid at where you worked? Were you</br>   in the wrong place at the wrong time?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: No. Detained with the police.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it for a traffic violation, affiliation with gangs, some little</br>   crime or some bigger crime?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: No, it was possession.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Possession of?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Of drugs.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of drugs?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is that a misdemeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes. Well it was kind of, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you detained?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes, I was detained.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For how long?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: The first time I was detained for maybe about six, seven months. The</br>   second time I was detained for almost a year.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: In immigration or in federal?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: In immigration. I was never in federal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where was that?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, the first time was in Phoenix, Arizona, and then the second</br>   time was in Atlanta, Georgia. Actually, I was in Gwinnett, Gwinnett County.</br>   And right there I was in the Jail Dog Program, so I used to sleep with my</br>   dog and everything in my cell.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's a Jail Dog Program?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: The Jail Dog Program is where the police department gets dogs from</br>   the streets and they help them to get a home. So, we had to train them. How</br>   to sit, how to roll, how to do stuff like that, with treats. And then the</br>   dogs, they put them on the news and then they'll have them do tricks and</br>   people will come and adopt the dogs. It's actually—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sort of like a rescue program?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah, it's actually on Facebook. It's called the Gwinnett Jail Dogs.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. When you came back to Mexico, did any authorities receive you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah, in the border.</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, they give us some lunch and they took us from the spot that we</br>   landed to the bus stations because it's too dangerous down here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Almost a year. I've been here since September.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You live in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I live by myself.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you live in an apartment, or?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you've worked, what job?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Right there, TeleTech. I work for Dish. I've been working for six</br>   months, but they have already moved me up like three... Well, the first</br>   one, it was the customer service, then tech and then right now I'm on level</br>   three.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, not really. I don't like the environment and the cops, they're</br>   all... No, it's different here. But I mean, I have to stick with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are your best memories of the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, being with my family, being with my kids. That is one of the</br>   best memories I do have.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like living in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah. I did like living in the United States. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Everything. Everything. Even the air. [Chuckles]. Yeah, everything</br>   was different. It's very different. I honestly don't like it down here. I</br>   mean, I don't like it. But then there's some people, I have some cousins,</br>   they don't like to be there. So, I mean, sometimes we like to joke around,</br>   let's trade spots, you know. Because they like Mexico and I don't like</br>   Mexico. They don't like being in the States. But that's because they were</br>   born over there. If they were born over here, they would be the same thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What don't you like about Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I just don't like how some people act you know? Or the cops here too,</br>   like they're dangerous themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do Mexicans treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: It depends. Some people, they just see that you got good stuff and</br>   they just go ahead and rob you. Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle</br>   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when</br>   you are in the States it's not even like that. Or if it happens, it's one</br>   in million, or you know? But not all the time. Like here, I've been robbed</br>   here like three times already.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you in the States? So that you ended up back</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over</br>   and I was just with the people, but they'd said that—well they found drugs</br>   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side. So, I know</br>   that the rules is whoever's driving or the car owner has to be responsible.</br>   But they did not take it like that. They just said... I didn't want to give</br>   them my name because I was scared. So, they took me for that too, giving a</br>   false name. But on top of that they put all the charges on me. So, they</br>   charged me for all the drugs because they didn't want to take the charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, they charged you instead of the person who had the drugs?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes. Yes, that's true.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd they do that?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I don't know, but they did. They didn't want to take the charge. But</br>   I mean, I was just with them because I was going to Walmart to do a return</br>   and they stopped us in a traffic stop and they blamed it all on me. I was</br>   trying to fight my case, but it was taking too long. I was getting too</br>   stressed out being inside in jail so I just signed the papers. I just</br>   wanted to get out, so I just took the charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you were growing up, were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: No, I was never. These tats on my face. I did them because of my</br>   kids. They all start with the letter A and at the time I only had three.</br>   So, I only have three stars because they're going to be stars. And I did</br>   them on my eyes because they're always going to be in my sight. So just</br>   three stars. They're my stars. And like, all my kids start with the letter</br>   A.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are your children's names?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Abigail, Aubrey and Austin. And Emily, but I didn't have her at the</br>   moment, at the time before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you did that after you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: No, I did that when I was in jail in Arizona.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did the stars?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And so, how did you manage not to get involved in a gang when so</br>   many people did?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I just never stuck with the wrong people. My parents were too strict.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So here, what's it like working at Teletech?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: It's a pretty nice job actually. I like dealing with customers. I</br>   like taking calls, it's nice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But don't people scream at you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Not if you talk to them, you know? Like you got to talk to them...</br>   But I mean, I do get kind of irritated sometimes. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What irritates you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Sometimes the customers, they don't understand, they don't know where</br>   some stuff is at. It just—sometimes it gets irritating after a while. Yeah,</br>   but it's a good job. I can't complain.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, I wonder if you can tell me—I know this is a little fake—but</br>   because it was so moving to me, in your own words what you told me outside.</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah. What I like about this job is that it makes me feel like at</br>   home, like in the States. Once I go in there, I forget about everything.</br>   Just when I do go out the reality hits me and I see that I'm not in the</br>   States, I'm in Mexico City. But I do like to be in there. If I could, I'd</br>   stay in there. Like I do overtime, I like to be talking with the customers,</br>   you know, in the States. Yeah. We have a good conversation sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you talk about lots of things about—</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, we talk about the shows, you know, the programming, what's</br>   available to talk about in TeleTech.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And if you would've stayed in the States, what do you think you</br>   would have done with your life?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I would have still been a painter. I would have probably got my own</br>   company since everybody gets one down there. I got friends that had their</br>   own company of painting, so maybe I would've done that too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what are your hopes now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Dreams">Ivan: Well, my hopes are now to stay here.

And I did</br>   them on my eyes because they're always going to be in my sight. So just</br>   three stars. They're my stars.

What I like about this job is that it makes me feel like at</br>   home, like in the States. Once I go in there, I forget about everything.</br>   Just when I do go out the reality hits me and I see that I'm not in the</br>   States, I'm in Mexico City. But I do like to be in there. If I could, I'd</br>   stay in there. Like I do overtime, I like to be talking with the customers,</br>   you know, in the States. Yeah. We have a good conversation sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you talk about lots of things about—</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, we talk about the shows, you know, the programming, what's</br>   available to talk about in TeleTech.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And if you would've stayed in the States, what do you think you</br>   would have done with your life?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I would have still been a painter. I would have probably got my own</br>   company since everybody gets one down there. I got friends that had their</br>   own company of painting, so maybe I would've done that too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what are your hopes now?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, my hopes are now to stay here. I want to stay in Teletech. I've</br>   been here for so long—well, not so long, but since I started. And so many</br>   people that are being there, they're already gone. So, we started together,</br>   but there's only like three of us, but I want to stay there. I want to</br>   stick around. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well, I wish you all the best.</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Thank you very much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And I hope your children come and visit you soon.</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah, hopefully very soon. Yeah.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
