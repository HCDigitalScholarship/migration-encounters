   Anita: How old are you Ivan?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: How old? I'm twenty-seven years old.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You were born in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes. I was born in Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Where in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: In the city of Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I didn't. Well, my parents took me when I was a kid. I was only like<br>
   three years old and so they took me to the States. I was a little boy. I<br>
   did not know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you know why they took you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: They wanted a better life.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How did you enter the U.S.? With a visa or did you just cross the<br>
   border?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: We just crossed.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How did you learn English?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: By going to school. I went to preschool, kindergarten, then I went to<br>
   middle school, high school.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So you went to school? Until what grade did you go to school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I went until twelfth grade.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You finished high school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: No.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you work in the U.S.?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes, I did. I had a lot of jobs in the U.S.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What kind of jobs?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Restaurant jobs. My last job was painting. I used to be a painter. I<br>
   used to paint houses, interior and exterior houses. I actually went and<br>
   painted the Braves stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Really?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You painted the Braves stadium?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yeah, I painted inside. With one of my bosses. We painted the inside<br>
   of that stadium. The hotel, it's called the Omni Hotel right now. Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Wow. How many years did you work in the U.S.?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Well, ever since I was fifteen or fourteen. My first job was at a<br>
   Rainforest Cafe, down in Arizona.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I did the work for, I worked there in a couple of jobs. I was a<br>
   janitor. I used to work for ASU.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Who did you live with when you were in the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I lived by myself. I was renting an apartment.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But when you first went?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Oh, when I first went? With my parents.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you have brothers and sisters?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: No, I'm the only child.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States? Was it your decision?<br>
   Were you detained and deported?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I was detained and deported.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, in one word, how did this happen? Were you detained by the<br>
   police? Were you imprisoned? Was there a raid at where you worked? Were you<br>
   in the wrong place at the wrong time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: No. Detained with the police.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was it for a traffic violation, affiliation with gangs, some little<br>
   crime or some bigger crime?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: No, it was possession.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Possession of?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Of drugs.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Of drugs?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Is that a misdemeanor?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes. Well it was kind of, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Were you detained?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes, I was detained.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: For how long?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: The first time I was detained for maybe about six, seven months. The<br>
   second time I was detained for almost a year.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: In immigration or in federal?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: In immigration. I was never in federal.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Where was that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Well, the first time was in Phoenix, Arizona, and then the second<br>
   time was in Atlanta, Georgia. Actually, I was in Gwinnett, Gwinnett County.<br>
   And right there I was in the Jail Dog Program, so I used to sleep with my<br>
   dog and everything in my cell.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What's a Jail Dog Program?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: The Jail Dog Program is where the police department gets dogs from<br>
   the streets and they help them to get a home. So, we had to train them. How<br>
   to sit, how to roll, how to do stuff like that, with treats. And then the<br>
   dogs, they put them on the news and then they'll have them do tricks and<br>
   people will come and adopt the dogs. It's actuallyâ€”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Sort of like a rescue program?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yeah, it's actually on Facebook. It's called the Gwinnett Jail Dogs.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Okay. When you came back to Mexico, did any authorities receive you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yeah, in the border.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Well, they give us some lunch and they took us from the spot that we<br>
   landed to the bus stations because it's too dangerous down here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Almost a year. I've been here since September.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You live in Mexico City?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Who do you live with now?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I live by myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you live in an apartment, or?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you've worked, what job?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Right there, TeleTech. I work for Dish. I've been working for six<br>
   months, but they have already moved me up like three... Well, the first<br>
   one, it was the customer service, then tech and then right now I'm on level<br>
   three.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Well, not really. I don't like the environment and the cops, they're<br>
   all... No, it's different here. But I mean, I have to stick with it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What are your best memories of the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Well, being with my family, being with my kids. That is one of the<br>
   best memories I do have.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Did you like living in the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yeah. I did like living in the United States. Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What did you like?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Everything. Everything. Even the air. [Chuckles]. Yeah, everything<br>
   was different. It's very different. I honestly don't like it down here. I<br>
   mean, I don't like it. But then there's some people, I have some cousins,<br>
   they don't like to be there. So, I mean, sometimes we like to joke around,<br>
   let's trade spots, you know. Because they like Mexico and I don't like<br>
   Mexico. They don't like being in the States. But that's because they were<br>
   born over there. If they were born over here, they would be the same thing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What don't you like about Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I just don't like how some people act you know? Or the cops here too,<br>
   like they're dangerous themselves.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How do Mexicans treat you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: It depends. Some people, they just see that you got good stuff and<br>
   they just go ahead and rob you. Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle<br>
   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when<br>
   you are in the States it's not even like that. Or if it happens, it's one<br>
   in million, or you know? But not all the time. Like here, I've been robbed<br>
   here like three times already.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, what happened to you in the States? So that you ended up back<br>
   here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over<br>
   and I was just with the people, but they'd said thatâ€”well they found drugs<br>
   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side. So, I know<br>
   that the rules is whoever's driving or the car owner has to be responsible.<br>
   But they did not take it like that. They just said... I didn't want to give<br>
   them my name because I was scared. So, they took me for that too, giving a<br>
   false name. But on top of that they put all the charges on me. So, they<br>
   charged me for all the drugs because they didn't want to take the charge.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, they charged you instead of the person who had the drugs?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yes. Yes, that's true.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Why'd they do that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I don't know, but they did. They didn't want to take the charge. But<br>
   I mean, I was just with them because I was going to Walmart to do a return<br>
   and they stopped us in a traffic stop and they blamed it all on me. I was<br>
   trying to fight my case, but it was taking too long. I was getting too<br>
   stressed out being inside in jail so I just signed the papers. I just<br>
   wanted to get out, so I just took the charge.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: When you were growing up, were you part of a gang?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: No, I was never. These tats on my face. I did them because of my<br>
   kids. They all start with the letter A and at the time I only had three.<br>
   So, I only have three stars because they're going to be stars. And I did<br>
   them on my eyes because they're always going to be in my sight. So just<br>
   three stars. They're my stars. And like, all my kids start with the letter<br>
   A.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What are your children's names?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Abigail, Aubrey and Austin. And Emily, but I didn't have her at the<br>
   moment, at the time before.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, you did that after you came back here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: No, I did that when I was in jail in Arizona.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You did the stars?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And so, how did you manage not to get involved in a gang when so<br>
   many people did?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I just never stuck with the wrong people. My parents were too strict.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So here, what's it like working at Teletech?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: It's a pretty nice job actually. I like dealing with customers. I<br>
   like taking calls, it's nice.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: But don't people scream at you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Not if you talk to them, you know? Like you got to talk to them...<br>
   But I mean, I do get kind of irritated sometimes. [Chuckles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What irritates you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Sometimes the customers, they don't understand, they don't know where<br>
   some stuff is at. It justâ€”sometimes it gets irritating after a while. Yeah,<br>
   but it's a good job. I can't complain.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So, I wonder if you can tell meâ€”I know this is a little fakeâ€”but<br>
   because it was so moving to me, in your own words what you told me outside.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yeah. What I like about this job is that it makes me feel like at<br>
   home, like in the States. Once I go in there, I forget about everything.<br>
   Just when I do go out the reality hits me and I see that I'm not in the<br>
   States, I'm in Mexico City. But I do like to be in there. If I could, I'd<br>
   stay in there. Like I do overtime, I like to be talking with the customers,<br>
   you know, in the States. Yeah. We have a good conversation sometimes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Do you talk about lots of things aboutâ€”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Well, we talk about the shows, you know, the programming, what's<br>
   available to talk about in TeleTech.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And if you would've stayed in the States, what do you think you<br>
   would have done with your life?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: I would have still been a painter. I would have probably got my own<br>
   company since everybody gets one down there. I got friends that had their<br>
   own company of painting, so maybe I would've done that too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And what are your hopes now?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Well, my hopes are now to stay here. I want to stay in Teletech. I've<br>
   been here for so longâ€”well, not so long, but since I started. And so many<br>
   people that are being there, they're already gone. So, we started together,<br>
   but there's only like three of us, but I want to stay there. I want to<br>
   stick around. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Well, I wish you all the best.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Thank you very much.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: And I hope your children come and visit you soon.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ivan: Yeah, hopefully very soon. Yeah.<br>
