That is one of the</br>   best memories I do have.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like living in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah. I did like living in the United States. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Everything. Everything. Even the air. [Chuckles]. Yeah, everything</br>   was different. It's very different. I honestly don't like it down here. I</br>   mean, I don't like it. But then there's some people, I have some cousins,</br>   they don't like to be there. So, I mean, sometimes we like to joke around,</br>   let's trade spots, you know. Because they like Mexico and I don't like</br>   Mexico. They don't like being in the States. But that's because they were</br>   born over there. If they were born over here, they would be the same thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What don't you like about Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I just don't like how some people act you know? Or the cops here too,</br>   like they're dangerous themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do Mexicans treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: It depends. Some people, they just see that you got good stuff and</br>   they just go ahead and rob you. Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle</br>   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when</br>   you are in the States it's not even like that. Or if it happens, it's one</br>   in million, or you know? But not all the time. Like here, I've been robbed</br>   here like three times already.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you in the States? So that you ended up back</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over</br>   and I was just with the people, but they'd said that—well they found drugs</br>   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side. So, I know</br>   that the rules is whoever's driving or the car owner has to be responsible.</br>   But they did not take it like that. They just said... I didn't want to give</br>   them my name because I was scared. So, they took me for that too, giving a</br>   false name. But on top of that they put all the charges on me. So, they</br>   charged me for all the drugs because they didn't want to take the charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, they charged you instead of the person who had the drugs?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes. Yes, that's true.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd they do that?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I don't know, but they did. They didn't want to take the charge. But</br>   I mean, I was just with them because I was going to Walmart to do a return</br>   and they stopped us in a traffic stop and they blamed it all on me. I was</br>   trying to fight my case, but it was taking too long. I was getting too</br>   stressed out being inside in jail so I just signed the papers. I just</br>   wanted to get out, so I just took the charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you were growing up, were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: No, I was never. These tats on my face. I did them because of my</br>   kids. They all start with the letter A and at the time I only had three.</br>   So, I only have three stars because they're going to be stars. And I did</br>   them on my eyes because they're always going to be in my sight. So just</br>   three stars. They're my stars. And like, all my kids start with the letter</br>   A.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are your children's names?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Abigail, Aubrey and Austin. And Emily, but I didn't have her at the</br>   moment, at the time before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you did that after you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: No, I did that when I was in jail in Arizona.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did the stars?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And so, how did you manage not to get involved in a gang when so</br>   many people did?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I just never stuck with the wrong people. My parents were too strict.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So here, what's it like working at Teletech?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: It's a pretty nice job actually. I like dealing with customers. I</br>   like taking calls, it's nice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But don't people scream at you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Not if you talk to them, you know? Like you got to talk to them...</br>   But I mean, I do get kind of irritated sometimes. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What irritates you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Sometimes the customers, they don't understand, they don't know where</br>   some stuff is at. It just—sometimes it gets irritating after a while. Yeah,</br>   but it's a good job.

I was never in federal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Where was that?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, the first time was in Phoenix, Arizona, and then the second</br>   time was in Atlanta, Georgia. Actually, I was in Gwinnett, Gwinnett County.</br>   And right there I was in the Jail Dog Program, so I used to sleep with my</br>   dog and everything in my cell.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's a Jail Dog Program?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: The Jail Dog Program is where the police department gets dogs from</br>   the streets and they help them to get a home. So, we had to train them. How</br>   to sit, how to roll, how to do stuff like that, with treats. And then the</br>   dogs, they put them on the news and then they'll have them do tricks and</br>   people will come and adopt the dogs. It's actually—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Sort of like a rescue program?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah, it's actually on Facebook. It's called the Gwinnett Jail Dogs.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay. When you came back to Mexico, did any authorities receive you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah, in the border.</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, they give us some lunch and they took us from the spot that we</br>   landed to the bus stations because it's too dangerous down here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Almost a year.

I work for Dish. I've been working for six</br>   months, but they have already moved me up like three... Well, the first</br>   one, it was the customer service, then tech and then right now I'm on level</br>   three.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, not really. I don't like the environment and the cops, they're</br>   all... No, it's different here. But I mean, I have to stick with it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are your best memories of the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, being with my family, being with my kids. That is one of the</br>   best memories I do have.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like living in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah. I did like living in the United States. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Everything. Everything. Even the air. [Chuckles]. Yeah, everything</br>   was different. It's very different. I honestly don't like it down here. I</br>   mean, I don't like it. But then there's some people, I have some cousins,</br>   they don't like to be there. So, I mean, sometimes we like to joke around,</br>   let's trade spots, you know. Because they like Mexico and I don't like</br>   Mexico. They don't like being in the States. But that's because they were</br>   born over there. If they were born over here, they would be the same thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What don't you like about Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I just don't like how some people act you know? Or the cops here too,</br>   like they're dangerous themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do Mexicans treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: It depends. Some people, they just see that you got good stuff and</br>   they just go ahead and rob you. Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle</br>   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when</br>   you are in the States it's not even like that. Or if it happens, it's one</br>   in million, or you know? But not all the time. Like here, I've been robbed</br>   here like three times already.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you in the States? So that you ended up back</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over</br>   and I was just with the people, but they'd said that—well they found drugs</br>   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side.

Some people, they just see that you got good stuff and</br>   they just go ahead and rob you. Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle</br>   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when</br>   you are in the States it's not even like that.

Or the cops here too,</br>   like they're dangerous themselves.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How do Mexicans treat you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: It depends. Some people, they just see that you got good stuff and</br>   they just go ahead and rob you. Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle</br>   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when</br>   you are in the States it's not even like that. Or if it happens, it's one</br>   in million, or you know? But not all the time. Like here, I've been robbed</br>   here like three times already.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you in the States? So that you ended up back</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over</br>   and I was just with the people, but they'd said that—well they found drugs</br>   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side. So, I know</br>   that the rules is whoever's driving or the car owner has to be responsible.</br>   But they did not take it like that. They just said... I didn't want to give</br>   them my name because I was scared. So, they took me for that too, giving a</br>   false name. But on top of that they put all the charges on me. So, they</br>   charged me for all the drugs because they didn't want to take the charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, they charged you instead of the person who had the drugs?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yes. Yes, that's true.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why'd they do that?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I don't know, but they did. They didn't want to take the charge. But</br>   I mean, I was just with them because I was going to Walmart to do a return</br>   and they stopped us in a traffic stop and they blamed it all on me. I was</br>   trying to fight my case, but it was taking too long. I was getting too</br>   stressed out being inside in jail so I just signed the papers. I just</br>   wanted to get out, so I just took the charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: When you were growing up, were you part of a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: No, I was never. These tats on my face. I did them because of my</br>   kids. They all start with the letter A and at the time I only had three.</br>   So, I only have three stars because they're going to be stars. And I did</br>   them on my eyes because they're always going to be in my sight. So just</br>   three stars. They're my stars. And like, all my kids start with the letter</br>   A.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What are your children's names?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Abigail, Aubrey and Austin. And Emily, but I didn't have her at the</br>   moment, at the time before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, you did that after you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: No, I did that when I was in jail in Arizona.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You did the stars?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And so, how did you manage not to get involved in a gang when so</br>   many people did?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I just never stuck with the wrong people. My parents were too strict.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So here, what's it like working at Teletech?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: It's a pretty nice job actually. I like dealing with customers. I</br>   like taking calls, it's nice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But don't people scream at you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Not if you talk to them, you know? Like you got to talk to them...</br>   But I mean, I do get kind of irritated sometimes. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What irritates you?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Sometimes the customers, they don't understand, they don't know where</br>   some stuff is at. It just—sometimes it gets irritating after a while. Yeah,</br>   but it's a good job. I can't complain.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, I wonder if you can tell me—I know this is a little fake—but</br>   because it was so moving to me, in your own words what you told me outside.</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah. What I like about this job is that it makes me feel like at</br>   home, like in the States. Once I go in there, I forget about everything.</br>   Just when I do go out the reality hits me and I see that I'm not in the</br>   States, I'm in Mexico City. But I do like to be in there. If I could, I'd</br>   stay in there. Like I do overtime, I like to be talking with the customers,</br>   you know, in the States. Yeah. We have a good conversation sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you talk about lots of things about—</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, we talk about the shows, you know, the programming, what's</br>   available to talk about in TeleTech.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And if you would've stayed in the States, what do you think you</br>   would have done with your life?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: I would have still been a painter. I would have probably got my own</br>   company since everybody gets one down there. I got friends that had their</br>   own company of painting, so maybe I would've done that too.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what are your hopes now?</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Well, my hopes are now to stay here. I want to stay in Teletech. I've</br>   been here for so long—well, not so long, but since I started. And so many</br>   people that are being there, they're already gone. So, we started together,</br>   but there's only like three of us, but I want to stay there. I want to</br>   stick around. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Well, I wish you all the best.</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Thank you very much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And I hope your children come and visit you soon.</br> </br> </br>   Ivan: Yeah, hopefully very soon. Yeah.</br> </div><\p></p>
