Could you tell me that story?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yes. When I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">fifth</span> grade, I always saw these kids that have</br>   their patrol flex and I told my counselor that I wanted to be a patrol.</br>   They told me that I can join this patrol and they put me on proof. I was</br>   doing really well. I had these trips to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">the Mall of America</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the</br>   scenarios, I remember Ms. _______, it was on my _____ School and she</br>   offered me if I wanted to go make an essay because there was a how can you</br>   say – there was a program where they said that we can get in contact to go</br>   and visit <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">the White House</span> because I wanted to learn a little bit more about</br>   the culture.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: So, I make my essay in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. She helped me for around three</br>   months to get all of the essay translated to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. She also was helping</br>   me making my essay. I remember that it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">around 800 words</span>. We had to</br>   write out, so I make my effort. She helped me send all the forms and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> or</br>   three weeks after, I received a letter. It was coming also with the stamp</br>   the color gold and because on those times I was not really getting into the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: I brought it to her and to see if she can translate it for me and</br>   she was telling me, actually she didn't want it to hurt my feelings, so she</br>   started telling me in other words that I didn't qualify because there was</br>   things missing on the essay, but now that I can understand it, I can see</br>   that because of my immigration status I was not able to qualify for the</br>   visit to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">the White House</span>. So I still have the envelope, as a memory, and I</br>   have all those papers. Basically with all my information, they were telling</br>   me that because my immigration status, I cannot go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the White House</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Just because of your immigration status.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: I remember since that day I decided not to participate in any</br>   program because I know that I was not going to be able because of my</br>   immigration status so I make my own goals. They were still learning <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span></br>   and get back here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> so I can continue to study because she also</br>   told me when I was in junior high - I frequently went to visit her - and</br>   she told me that I needed to think about it if I want to continue with the</br>   University because the patrol stuff that I was doing, it was going to give</br>   me points so I can get into the University, but I wasn't going to be able</br>   to get enough points. I needed to pay like a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">monthly</span> charge and it was</br>   going to be a really expensive. So, she offered it to me that we can</br>   continue, try to see if we can get any type of help so you can continue</br>   studying and also my parents offered me if I wanted came back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   because I wanted to get into the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Army</span>, but they told me that if I want to</br>   serve to country that I should serve to my country. So that's another</br>   reason why I also come back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Did you think about serving in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Army</span> in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> or in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Actually, this get into my mind because my brother when he was on</br>   the senior high, he got this paper saying that he wanted to serve but it</br>   was just a copy, not the hard copy. My dad just break it off and say if you</br>   want to go serve to a country, serve to your country. My brother came on to</br>   tell us in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2015</span> and in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2016</span> that he get into the Mexico army.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Do you still want to join the army here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Actually, I try it <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> times. I try <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> for an engineer and</br>   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> one. I</br>   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon</br>   and because of the spaces we have to wait <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15 days</span> to see if anyone quits</br>   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve</br>   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">seventh</span></br>   space, so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.</br>   The other two times I tried again, but the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time they told me for the</br>   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on</br>   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told</br>   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: You were too old?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: What was the age limit?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">21</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: You could not be older than <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">21</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: So if you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">above 21</span> they have another careers, but you cannot get</br>   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but</br>   because I don’t have a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">20/20</span> [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.</br>   On the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again</br>   that was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">24</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">last year</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">24</span> was the cutoff?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you</br>   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my</br>   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Marines</span>, but once he</br>   get here on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was</br>   from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Air Army</span>, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able</br>   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree</br>   that you're working on?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for</br>   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of</br>   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,</br>   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">25,000</span> per</br>   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to</br>   Canada.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: To <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the</br>   degree.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Can you tell me more about why <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span> instead of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span></br>   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Impossible. Yep.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this</br>   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with</br>   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a week</span> that you can only go</br>   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or</br>   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that</br>   most people are scared of providing information to the government.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: With all it's happening with <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span>, no one wants to really give the</br>   extra step.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say</br>   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be</br>   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span> here</br>   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I</br>   know that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> dollar compared to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span> dollar, it's a little</br>   cheaper <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span>, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning</br>   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to</br>   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy</br>   to go back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I</br>   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your</br>   country if you can, to keep the talented people here. Could you talk more</br>   about that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they</br>   were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on</br>   the whole world, but it became from a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. So, I want to mark the</br>   history of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and have a special project an invent that could help the</br>   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and not</br>   saying it was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   who got development in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Canada</span> or the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span> and here's the achievement. So</br>   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Metro</span> cards?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: It's an invent from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Politecnico</span> and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: A layer to go on the roof that it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">a hundred percent</span> ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. We can</br>   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue</br>   with that because it's okay if I say on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the</br>   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your</br>   country and using your talents.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that</br>   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless</br>   electricity, like <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Nikola Tesla</span>, we have a lot of great minds that we're</br>   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some</br>   projects.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> more</br>   question. Do you consider yourself <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> or both?</br>   So, after the time that you spent in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> do you consider a part of</br>   yourself to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>? Or only <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: I will say that I consider myself a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> who lived in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S</span>..</br>   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take</br>   the good things that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> leave to me for example, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">English</span> and then</br>   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the</br>   bad experience that I had over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Like what? What were some of the bad experiences?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either</br>   that it was not, we could say, a whole <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> school. It was like a mix</br>   school where there were people from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Asia</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Thailand</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Greece</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Nigeria</span>, and us</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latinos</span> were from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guatemala</span> and all this stuff. We were on this special</br>   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the</br>   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: The white kids?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little</br>   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> kids, they</br>   were saying that to all of us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: To those of you that were learning <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">less than two years</span> to</br>   gain or improve my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. I went from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">seventh</span> grade I was on ELL 1 all</br>   the way to Read <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">180</span>. I remember there was a skill that they had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">six</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span></br>   year.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Oh wow. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">One year</span>. I know that scale. That's very impressive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed</br>   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal</br>   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little</br>   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as</br>   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I</br>   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so</br>   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest</br>   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was</br>   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do</br>   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Like a complaint?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their</br>   complaints saying that they don't want a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> to deliver their papers</br>   and there were homes where we will, as <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, we always like to give our</br>   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to</br>   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being</br>   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of</br>   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be</br>   affecting you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: That's awful. I’m sorry...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas</br>   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was</br>   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of</br>   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the</br>   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good</br>   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time, there was a</br>   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like</br>   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and they start saying... Can I say for example?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Yes, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Literally they were saying, &quot;Oh, look at this <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latino</span> community area because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Minnesota</span>, there is not a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latinos</span>, but</br>   there was a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African</span> people and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Thailand</span>. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African American</span> community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can</br>   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to</br>   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I</br>   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start</br>   with customer service. We know that most <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>, they don't like to deal</br>   with same <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I</br>   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a</br>   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> and I</br>   don't want to talk to a different people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: That's not an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, but sometimes we're better customer service</br>   that we can provide a better experience. That's why I decided to leave my</br>   mark on their minds, giving them a better customer service so they can know</br>   that we're not bad, that we can help them and we can be on the same</br>   community without being racist. Also, I have bad experience. I can tell you</br>   all my job that sometimes they taught us well, if I can say it...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: &quot;I don’t want to fuck with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> so transfer me to an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span></br>   department&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: People say that on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Sometimes they say, &quot;I don't trust <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>,</br>   they're criminals. So I don't want to give any of my personal information”.</br>   Even if it's just for payment or just for providing any information,</br>   knowing that they are calling their company, we're not calling them. It's</br>   basically their information is secure with us and it's not just for being</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> that I'm going to rob them, but it happens all the time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: It happens all the time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">Three</span> of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">ten</span> customers. They'll always do that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: That's quite a bit. That's a lot of customers.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Is that stressful for you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: It's not stressful. It's more like frustrating because we can help</br>   them and it's something so simple because of a closed mind we cannot do our</br>   job sometimes and sometimes we do everything good. They like it, we solve</br>   their problems, but at the end they just finish with a comment saying &quot;fuck</br>   with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, I don't like this service&quot; and they can switch away…</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: That's so awful.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: It's something that we have to deal with it on customer service, but</br>   we are used to it. We have to have a centered mind, we don't [inaudible]</br>   over accelerate with the customer. We always provide a smile, a good</br>   customer service, and everything's okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: You have to be the one to stay calm even when they're being rude to</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah. That's customer service.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: The customer is always right. Isn't that what they say?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Yeah. But even if they're not, they're always right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Yeah. Even if they're a jerk. As we start wrapping up here, is</br>   there anything else that you feel like you haven't gotten the chance to say</br>   about your experience as a migrant going to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> coming back? Anything</br>   you want us to understand about you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: I wish that they can be a little bit more easy so we can have a</br>   status that doesn't get us into illegal stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: For example, being crossing as an immigrant instead of crossing on</br>   the flight because it could help them also to get more in more income</br>   instead of just paying a [coyote] so they can cross us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Yeah. So we need some immigration reform to fix the system.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: A little.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: I agree. I really, really appreciate you coming in and talking and</br>   being so honest about your experiences and I know some of it's</br>   uncomfortable to talk about.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: It's something that we need sometimes to just throw it out and not</br>   keep it inside.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: Good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: It's good because I see that you're from over there, so I always</br>   know that I can talk to someone and tell them how I feel because sometimes</br>   they say &quot;fuck off, I don't care&quot;. And on this case you are taking the time</br>   to listen to us, so it's pretty nice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: That's our goal to hear from you in your own words and then to</br>   trying to figure out how to get other people, other <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> to have</br>   compassion too and to understand.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: I will not say compassion because we're not searching for</br>   compassion, what we are searching is just to be treated as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: As equals.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: As equal because compassion you are feeling bad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span>: When I say compassion, I don't mean feeling bad, but understanding.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Frank</span>: Understanding, it's a better word, yeah. Anything else?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Lizzie</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Immigration status, Broken system, In the shadows, Lost opportunities, School, Teachers, Working hard, getting good grades">there was a program where they said that we can get in contact to go   and visit the White House because I wanted to learn a little bit more about   the culture.     Frank: So, I make my essay in Spanish. She helped me for around three   months to get all of the essay translated to English. She also was helping   me making my essay. I remember that it was around 800 words. We had to   write out, so I make my effort. She helped me send all the forms and two or   three weeks after, I received a letter. It was coming also with the stamp   the color gold and because on those times I was not really getting into the   English.     Frank: I brought it to her and to see if she can translate it for me and   she was telling me, actually she didn't want it to hurt my feelings, so she   started telling me in other words that I didn't qualify because there was   things missing on the essay, but now that I can understand it, I can see   that because of my immigration status I was not able to qualify for the   visit to the White House. So I still have the envelope, as a memory, and I   have all those papers. Basically with all my information, they were telling   me that because my immigration status, I cannot go to the White House.    </span> Lizzie: Just because of your immigration status.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I remember since that day I decided not to participate in any</br>   program because I know that I was not going to be able because of my</br>   immigration status so I make my own goals. They were still learning English</br>   and get back here to Mexico so I can continue to study because she also</br>   told me when I was in junior high - I frequently went to visit her - and</br>   she told me that I needed to think about it if I want to continue with the</br>   University because the patrol stuff that I was doing, it was going to give</br>   me points so I can get into the University, but I wasn't going to be able</br>   to get enough points. I needed to pay like a monthly charge and it was</br>   going to be a really expensive. So, she offered it to me that we can</br>   continue, try to see if we can get any type of help so you can continue</br>   studying and also my parents offered me if I wanted came back to Mexico</br>   because I wanted to get into the Army, but they told me that if I want to</br>   serve to country that I should serve to my country. So that's another</br>   reason why I also come back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you think about serving in the Army in the U.S. or in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, this get into my mind because my brother when he was on</br>   the senior high, he got this paper saying that he wanted to serve but it</br>   was just a copy, not the hard copy. My dad just break it off and say if you</br>   want to go serve to a country, serve to your country. My brother came on to</br>   tell us in 2015 and in 2016 that he get into the Mexico army.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still want to join the army here?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, I try it four times. I try first for an engineer and</br>   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I</br>   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon</br>   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits</br>   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve</br>   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh</br>   space, so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.</br>   The other two times I tried again, but the first time they told me for the</br>   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on</br>   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told</br>   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You were too old?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: What was the age limit?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: 21.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You could not be older than 21?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So if you're above 21 they have another careers, but you cannot get</br>   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but</br>   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.</br>   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again</br>   that was 24 last year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: 24 was the cutoff?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you</br>   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my</br>   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he</br>   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was</br>   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able</br>   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree</br>   that you're working on?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for</br>   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of</br>   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,</br>   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per</br>   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to</br>   Canada.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To Canada?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the</br>   degree.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Can you tell me more about why Canada instead of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to</br>   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US</br>   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this</br>   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with</br>   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go</br>   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or</br>   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that</br>   most people are scared of providing information to the government.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With all it's happening with Trump, no one wants to really give the</br>   extra step.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say</br>   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be</br>   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here</br>   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I</br>   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little</br>   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning</br>   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to</br>   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy</br>   to go back to USA.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I</br>   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your</br>   country if you can, to keep the talented people here. Could you talk more</br>   about that?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they</br>   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on</br>   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the</br>   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the</br>   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not</br>   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican</br>   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So</br>   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the Metro cards?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can</br>   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue</br>   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the</br>   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your</br>   country and using your talents.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that</br>   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless</br>   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're</br>   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some</br>   projects.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just one more</br>   question. Do you consider yourself Mexican or Mexican and American or both?</br>   So, after the time that you spent in the US do you consider a part of</br>   yourself to be American? Or only Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I will say that I consider myself a Mexican who lived in the U.S..</br>   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take</br>   the good things that U.S. leave to me for example, the English and then</br>   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the</br>   bad experience that I had over there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like what? What were some of the bad experiences?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either</br>   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix</br>   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us</br>   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special</br>   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the</br>   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little</br>   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they</br>   were saying that to all of us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to</br>   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all</br>   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one</br>   year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed</br>   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal</br>   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little</br>   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as</br>   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I</br>   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so</br>   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest</br>   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was</br>   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do</br>   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a complaint?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their</br>   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers</br>   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our</br>   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to</br>   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being</br>   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of</br>   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be</br>   affecting you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's awful. I’m sorry...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas</br>   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was</br>   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of</br>   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the</br>   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good</br>   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for first time, there was a</br>   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like</br>   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know</br>   English and they start saying... Can I say for example?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yes, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Literally they were saying, &quot;Oh, look at this Mexicans. They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but</br>   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with American people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can</br>   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to</br>   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I</br>   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start</br>   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal</br>   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I</br>   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a</br>   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I</br>   don't want to talk to a different people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's not an American, but sometimes we're better customer service</br>   that we can provide a better experience. That's why I decided to leave my</br>   mark on their minds, giving them a better customer service so they can know</br>   that we're not bad, that we can help them and we can be on the same</br>   community without being racist. Also, I have bad experience. I can tell you</br>   all my job that sometimes they taught us well, if I can say it...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: &quot;I don’t want to fuck with Mexicans so transfer me to an American</br>   department&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: People say that on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Sometimes they say, &quot;I don't trust Mexicans because Mexicans,</br>   they're criminals. So I don't want to give any of my personal information”.</br>   Even if it's just for payment or just for providing any information,</br>   knowing that they are calling their company, we're not calling them. It's</br>   basically their information is secure with us and it's not just for being</br>   Mexican that I'm going to rob them, but it happens all the time.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: It happens all the time?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Three of ten customers. They'll always do that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's quite a bit. That's a lot of customers.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Is that stressful for you?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's not stressful. It's more like frustrating because we can help</br>   them and it's something so simple because of a closed mind we cannot do our</br>   job sometimes and sometimes we do everything good. They like it, we solve</br>   their problems, but at the end they just finish with a comment saying &quot;fuck</br>   with Mexicans, I don't like this service&quot; and they can switch away…</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's so awful.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's something that we have to deal with it on customer service, but</br>   we are used to it. We have to have a centered mind, we don't [inaudible]</br>   over accelerate with the customer. We always provide a smile, a good</br>   customer service, and everything's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You have to be the one to stay calm even when they're being rude to</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. That's customer service.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The customer is always right. Isn't that what they say?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. But even if they're not, they're always right.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah. Even if they're a jerk. As we start wrapping up here, is</br>   there anything else that you feel like you haven't gotten the chance to say</br>   about your experience as a migrant going to the U.S. coming back? Anything</br>   you want us to understand about you?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I wish that they can be a little bit more easy so we can have a</br>   status that doesn't get us into illegal stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, being crossing as an immigrant instead of crossing on</br>   the flight because it could help them also to get more in more income</br>   instead of just paying a [coyote] so they can cross us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah. So we need some immigration reform to fix the system.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A little.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I agree. I really, really appreciate you coming in and talking and</br>   being so honest about your experiences and I know some of it's</br>   uncomfortable to talk about.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's something that we need sometimes to just throw it out and not</br>   keep it inside.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Good.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's good because I see that you're from over there, so I always</br>   know that I can talk to someone and tell them how I feel because sometimes</br>   they say &quot;fuck off, I don't care&quot;. And on this case you are taking the time</br>   to listen to us, so it's pretty nice.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's our goal to hear from you in your own words and then to</br>   trying to figure out how to get other people, other Americans to have</br>   compassion too and to understand.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Values">Frank: I will not say compassion because we're not searching for   compassion, what we are searching is just to be treated as well.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Frank: For example, being crossing as an immigrant instead of crossing on   the flight because it could help them also to get more in more income   instead of just paying a [coyote] so they can cross us.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs">Frank: It's something that we have to deal with it on customer service, but   we are used to it.

We always provide a smile, a good   customer service, and everything's okay.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Discrimination/stigmatization">k: It's not stressful.

I try first for an engineer and   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh   space,</span> so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.</br>   The other two times I tried again, but the first time they told me for the</br>   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on</br>   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told</br>   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You were too old?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: What was the age limit?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: 21.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You could not be older than 21?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So if you're above 21 they have another careers, but you cannot get</br>   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but</br>   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.</br>   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again</br>   that was 24 last year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: 24 was the cutoff?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you</br>   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my</br>   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he</br>   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was</br>   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able</br>   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree</br>   that you're working on?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for</br>   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of</br>   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,</br>   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per</br>   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to</br>   Canada.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To Canada?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the</br>   degree.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Can you tell me more about why Canada instead of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to</br>   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US</br>   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this</br>   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with</br>   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go</br>   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or</br>   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that</br>   most people are scared of providing information to the government.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With all it's happening with Trump, no one wants to really give the</br>   extra step.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say</br>   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be</br>   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here</br>   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I</br>   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little</br>   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning</br>   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to</br>   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy</br>   to go back to USA.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I</br>   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your</br>   country if you can, to keep the talented people here.

Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the Metro cards?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico.

So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I like that.

They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but</br>   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with American people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Values, Time in the US, Discrimination/stigmatization, Racism">Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I   don't want to talk to a different people.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Elementary">Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix   communities because I didn't want to go to ____.

They were making me a little   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest   experience.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Learning English">Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one   year.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Discrimination/stigmatization, Racism">Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they   were saying that to all of us.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs">Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some   projects.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Values">Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark   here on Mexico.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs, Occupations">Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So   that's what I</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  careers ,  military/army">Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy   to go back to USA.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  careers , Immigration status, Lost opportunities,  , Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work, Documents">nk: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  careers">Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to   Canada.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  careers,  military/army">Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Siblings">Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps.

So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  careers">Frank: So if you're above 21 they have another careers, but you cannot get   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again   that was 24 last year.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Frank: Actually, I try it four times. I try first for an engineer and   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh   space,</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  careers,  military/army">So, she offered it to me that we can   continue, try to see if we can get any type of help so you can continue   studying and also my parents offered me if I wanted came back to Mexico   because I wanted to get into the Army, but they told me that if I want to   serve to country that I should serve to my country. So that's another   reason why I also come back to Mexico.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Being secretive, Lost opportunities, Living undocumented">Frank: I remember since that day I decided not to participate in any   program because I know that I was not going to be able because of my   immigration status so I make my own goals. They were still learning English   and get back here to Mexico so I can continue to study because she also   told me when I was in junior high - I frequently went to visit her - and   she told me that I needed to think about it if I want to continue with the   University because the patrol stuff that I was doing, it was going to give   me points so I can get into the University, but I wasn't going to be able   to get enough points. I needed to pay like a monthly charge and it was   going to be a really expensiv</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Elementary, Time in the US, School, Learning English/ ESL">Frank: I brought it to her and to see if she can translate it for me and   she was telling me, actually she didn't want it to hurt my feelings, so she   started telling me in other words that I didn't qualify because there was   things missing on the essay, but now that I can understand it, I can see   that because of my immigration status I was not able to qualify for the   visit to the White House. So I still have the envelope, as a memory, and I   have all those papers. Basically with all my information, they were telling   me that because my immigration status, I cannot go to the White House.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Learning English/ ESL">Frank: So, I make my essay in Spanish. She helped me for around three   months to get all of the essay translated to English. She also was helping   me making my essay. I remember that it was around 800 words. We had to   write out, so I make my effort. She helped me send all the forms and two or   three weeks after, I received a letter. It was coming also with the stamp   the color gold and because on those times I was not really getting into the   English.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Elementary">Frank: Yes. When I was in fifth grade, I always saw these kids that have   their patrol flex and I told my counselor that I wanted to be a patrol.   They told me that I can join this patrol and they put me on proof. I was   doing really well. I had these trips to the Mall of America and one of the   scenarios, I remember Ms. _______, it was on my _____ School and she   offered me if I wanted to go make an essay because there was a how can you   say – there was a program where they said that we can get in contact to go   and visit the White House because I wanted to learn a little bit more about   the culture.    </span> Frank: So, I make my essay in Spanish.

Basically with all my information, they were telling</br>   me that because my immigration status, I cannot go to the White House.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Just because of your immigration status.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I remember since that day I decided not to participate in any</br>   program because I know that I was not going to be able because of my</br>   immigration status so I make my own goals. They were still learning English</br>   and get back here to Mexico so I can continue to study because she also</br>   told me when I was in junior high - I frequently went to visit her - and</br>   she told me that I needed to think about it if I want to continue with the</br>   University because the patrol stuff that I was doing, it was going to give</br>   me points so I can get into the University, but I wasn't going to be able</br>   to get enough points.

So that's another</br>   reason why I also come back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you think about serving in the Army in the U.S. or in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, this get into my mind because my brother when he was on</br>   the senior high, he got this paper saying that he wanted to serve but it</br>   was just a copy, not the hard copy. My dad just break it off and say if you</br>   want to go serve to a country, serve to your country. My brother came on to</br>   tell us in 2015 and in 2016 that he get into the Mexico army.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still want to join the army here?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, I try it four times. I try first for an engineer and</br>   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I</br>   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon</br>   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits</br>   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve</br>   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh</br>   space, so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.</br>   The other two times I tried again, but the first time they told me for the</br>   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on</br>   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told</br>   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You were too old?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: What was the age limit?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: 21.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You could not be older than 21?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So if you're above 21 they have another careers, but you cannot get</br>   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but</br>   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.</br>   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again</br>   that was 24 last year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: 24 was the cutoff?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you</br>   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my</br>   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he</br>   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was</br>   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able</br>   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree</br>   that you're working on?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for</br>   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of</br>   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,</br>   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per</br>   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to</br>   Canada.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To Canada?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the</br>   degree.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Can you tell me more about why Canada instead of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to</br>   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US</br>   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this</br>   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with</br>   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go</br>   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or</br>   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that</br>   most people are scared of providing information to the government.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With all it's happening with Trump, no one wants to really give the</br>   extra step.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say</br>   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be</br>   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here</br>   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I</br>   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little</br>   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning</br>   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to</br>   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy</br>   to go back to USA.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I</br>   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your</br>   country if you can, to keep the talented people here. Could you talk more</br>   about that?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they</br>   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on</br>   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the</br>   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the</br>   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not</br>   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican</br>   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So</br>   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the Metro cards?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can</br>   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue</br>   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the</br>   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your</br>   country and using your talents.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that</br>   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless</br>   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're</br>   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some</br>   projects.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just one more</br>   question. Do you consider yourself Mexican or Mexican and American or both?</br>   So, after the time that you spent in the US do you consider a part of</br>   yourself to be American? Or only Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I will say that I consider myself a Mexican who lived in the U.S..</br>   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take</br>   the good things that U.S. leave to me for example, the English and then</br>   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the</br>   bad experience that I had over there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like what? What were some of the bad experiences?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either</br>   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix</br>   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us</br>   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special</br>   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the</br>   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little</br>   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they</br>   were saying that to all of us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to</br>   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all</br>   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one</br>   year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed</br>   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal</br>   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little</br>   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as</br>   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I</br>   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so</br>   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest</br>   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was</br>   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do</br>   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a complaint?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their</br>   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers</br>   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our</br>   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to</br>   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being</br>   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of</br>   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be</br>   affecting you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's awful. I’m sorry...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas</br>   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was</br>   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of</br>   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the</br>   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good</br>   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for first time, there was a</br>   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like</br>   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know</br>   English and they start saying... Can I say for example?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yes, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Literally they were saying, &quot;Oh, look at this Mexicans. They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but</br>   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with American people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can</br>   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to</br>   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I</br>   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start</br>   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal</br>   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I</br>   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a</br>   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I</br>   don't want to talk to a different people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's not an American, but sometimes we're better customer service</br>   that we can provide a better experience. That's why I decided to leave my</br>   mark on their minds, giving them a better customer service so they can know</br>   that we're not bad, that we can help them and we can be on the same</br>   community without being racist. Also, I have bad experience. I can tell you</br>   all my job that sometimes they taught us well, if I can say it...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: &quot;I don’t want to fuck with Mexicans so transfer me to an American</br>   department&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: People say that on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Racism, Worst parts">Frank: Sometimes they say, &quot;I don't trust Mexicans because Mexicans,   they're criminals. So I don't want to give any of my personal information”.   Even if it's just for payment or just for providing any information,   knowing that they are calling their company, we're not calling them. It's   basically their information is secure with us and it's not just for being   Mexican that I'm going to rob them, but it happens all the time.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Racism">Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,   instead of being with American people.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Discrimination, Racism, Discrimination/stigmatization">Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.     Lizzie: Like a complaint?     Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be   affecting you.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Discrimination, Racism, Bullying, School">Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="The United States, Worst parts, Policy to help migrants, Immigration status, Broken system, US government and immigration">Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.     Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.     Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that   most people are scared of providing information to the government.    </span> Frank: With all it's happening with Trump, no one wants to really give the</br>   extra step.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say</br>   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be</br>   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here</br>   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I</br>   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little</br>   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning</br>   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to</br>   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy</br>   to go back to USA.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I</br>   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your</br>   country if you can, to keep the talented people here. Could you talk more</br>   about that?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they</br>   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on</br>   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the</br>   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the</br>   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not</br>   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican</br>   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So</br>   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the Metro cards?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can</br>   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue</br>   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the</br>   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your</br>   country and using your talents.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that</br>   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless</br>   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're</br>   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some</br>   projects.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just one more</br>   question. Do you consider yourself Mexican or Mexican and American or both?</br>   So, after the time that you spent in the US do you consider a part of</br>   yourself to be American? Or only Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="The United States, Favorite parts, Identity, Mexican">Frank: I will say that I consider myself a Mexican who lived in the U.S..   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take   the good things that U.S. leave to me for example, the English and then   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the   bad experience that I had over there.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, What Mexico has gained, What the US has lost, Feelings, Pride, Identity, Mexican, Dreams">Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the   whole world.

Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Higher Education, Applying, Attending,  engineering, Return to Mexico, Reasons for Exit, Economic, Higher Education in Mexico, No hope for a future in the US">Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to   Canada.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Military,  Army, Mexico, Time in the US, Lost opportunities, Age">So, she offered it to me that we can   continue, try to see if we can get any type of help so you can continue   studying and also my parents offered me if I wanted came back to Mexico   because I wanted to get into the Army, but they told me that if I want to   serve to country that I should serve to my country. So that's another   reason why I also come back to Mexico.     Lizzie: Did you think about serving in the Army in the U.S. or in Mexico?     Frank: Actually, this get into my mind because my brother when he was on   the senior high, he got this paper saying that he wanted to serve but it   was just a copy, not the hard copy. My dad just break it off and say if you   want to go serve to a country, serve to your country. My brother came on to   tell us in 2015 and in 2016 that he get into the Mexico army.     Lizzie: Do you still want to join the army here?     Frank: Actually, I try it four times. I try first for an engineer and   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh   space, so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.   The other two times I tried again, but the first time they told me for the   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.    </span> Lizzie: You were too old?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: What was the age limit?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: 21.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You could not be older than 21?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So if you're above 21 they have another careers, but you cannot get</br>   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but</br>   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.</br>   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again</br>   that was 24 last year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: 24 was the cutoff?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you</br>   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my</br>   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he</br>   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was</br>   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able</br>   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree</br>   that you're working on?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for</br>   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of</br>   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,</br>   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per</br>   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to</br>   Canada.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To Canada?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the</br>   degree.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Can you tell me more about why Canada instead of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to</br>   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US</br>   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Impossible.

What were some of the bad experiences?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either</br>   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix</br>   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us</br>   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special</br>   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the</br>   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little</br>   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they</br>   were saying that to all of us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to</br>   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all</br>   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one</br>   year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed</br>   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal</br>   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little</br>   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as</br>   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I</br>   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so</br>   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest</br>   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was</br>   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do</br>   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a complaint?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their</br>   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers</br>   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our</br>   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to</br>   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being</br>   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of</br>   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be</br>   affecting you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's awful. I’m sorry...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas</br>   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was</br>   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of</br>   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the</br>   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good</br>   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for first time, there was a</br>   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like</br>   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know</br>   English and they start saying... Can I say for example?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yes, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Literally they were saying, &quot;Oh, look at this Mexicans. They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but</br>   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with American people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can</br>   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to</br>   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I</br>   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start</br>   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal</br>   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I</br>   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a</br>   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I</br>   don't want to talk to a different people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's not an American, but sometimes we're better customer service</br>   that we can provide a better experience. That's why I decided to leave my</br>   mark on their minds, giving them a better customer service so they can know</br>   that we're not bad, that we can help them and we can be on the same</br>   community without being racist. Also, I have bad experience. I can tell you</br>   all my job that sometimes they taught us well, if I can say it...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: &quot;I don’t want to fuck with Mexicans so transfer me to an American</br>   department&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: People say that on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Sometimes they say, &quot;I don't trust Mexicans because Mexicans,</br>   they're criminals. So I don't want to give any of my personal information”.</br>   Even if it's just for payment or just for providing any information,</br>   knowing that they are calling their company, we're not calling them. It's</br>   basically their information is secure with us and it's not just for being</br>   Mexican that I'm going to rob them, but it happens all the time.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: It happens all the time?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Three of ten customers. They'll always do that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's quite a bit. That's a lot of customers.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Is that stressful for you?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's not stressful. It's more like frustrating because we can help</br>   them and it's something so simple because of a closed mind we cannot do our</br>   job sometimes and sometimes we do everything good. They like it, we solve</br>   their problems, but at the end they just finish with a comment saying &quot;fuck</br>   with Mexicans, I don't like this service&quot; and they can switch away…</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's so awful.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's something that we have to deal with it on customer service, but</br>   we are used to it. We have to have a centered mind, we don't [inaudible]</br>   over accelerate with the customer. We always provide a smile, a good</br>   customer service, and everything's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You have to be the one to stay calm even when they're being rude to</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. That's customer service.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The customer is always right. Isn't that what they say?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. But even if they're not, they're always right.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah. Even if they're a jerk. As we start wrapping up here, is</br>   there anything else that you feel like you haven't gotten the chance to say</br>   about your experience as a migrant going to the U.S. coming back? Anything</br>   you want us to understand about you?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I wish that they can be a little bit more easy so we can have a</br>   status that doesn't get us into illegal stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, being crossing as an immigrant instead of crossing on</br>   the flight because it could help them also to get more in more income</br>   instead of just paying a [coyote] so they can cross us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah. So we need some immigration reform to fix the system.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A little.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I agree. I really, really appreciate you coming in and talking and</br>   being so honest about your experiences and I know some of it's</br>   uncomfortable to talk about.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's something that we need sometimes to just throw it out and not</br>   keep it inside.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Good.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's good because I see that you're from over there, so I always</br>   know that I can talk to someone and tell them how I feel because sometimes</br>   they say &quot;fuck off, I don't care&quot;. And on this case you are taking the time</br>   to listen to us, so it's pretty nice.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's our goal to hear from you in your own words and then to</br>   trying to figure out how to get other people, other Americans to have</br>   compassion too and to understand.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I will not say compassion because we're not searching for</br>   compassion, what we are searching is just to be treated as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: As equals.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: As equal because compassion you are feeling bad.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: When I say compassion, I don't mean feeling bad, but understanding.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Understanding, it's a better word, yeah. Anything else?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That is all.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
