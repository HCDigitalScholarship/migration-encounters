   and visit the White House because I wanted to learn a little bit more about<br>
   the culture.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: So, I make my essay in Spanish. She helped me for around three<br>
   months to get all of the essay translated to English. She also was helping<br>
   me making my essay. I remember that it was around 800 words. We had to<br>
   write out, so I make my effort. She helped me send all the forms and two or<br>
   three weeks after, I received a letter. It was coming also with the stamp<br>
   the color gold and because on those times I was not really getting into the<br>
   English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: I brought it to her and to see if she can translate it for me and<br>
   she was telling me, actually she didn't want it to hurt my feelings, so she<br>
   started telling me in other words that I didn't qualify because there was<br>
   things missing on the essay, but now that I can understand it, I can see<br>
   that because of my immigration status I was not able to qualify for the<br>
   visit to the White House. So I still have the envelope, as a memory, and I<br>
   have all those papers. Basically with all my information, they were telling<br>
   me that because my immigration status, I cannot go to the White House.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Lizzie: Just because of your immigration status.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I remember since that day I decided not to participate in any</br>   program because I know that I was not going to be able because of my</br>   immigration status so I make my own goals. They were still learning English</br>   and get back here to Mexico so I can continue to study because she also</br>   told me when I was in junior high - I frequently went to visit her - and</br>   she told me that I needed to think about it if I want to continue with the</br>   University because the patrol stuff that I was doing, it was going to give</br>   me points so I can get into the University, but I wasn't going to be able</br>   to get enough points. I needed to pay like a monthly charge and it was</br>   going to be a really expensive. So, she offered it to me that we can</br>   continue, try to see if we can get any type of help so you can continue</br>   studying and also my parents offered me if I wanted came back to Mexico</br>   because I wanted to get into the Army, but they told me that if I want to</br>   serve to country that I should serve to my country. So that's another</br>   reason why I also come back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you think about serving in the Army in the U.S. or in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, this get into my mind because my brother when he was on</br>   the senior high, he got this paper saying that he wanted to serve but it</br>   was just a copy, not the hard copy. My dad just break it off and say if you</br>   want to go serve to a country, serve to your country. My brother came on to</br>   tell us in 2015 and in 2016 that he get into the Mexico army.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still want to join the army here?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, I try it four times. I try first for an engineer and</br>   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I</br>   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon</br>   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits</br>   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve</br>   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh</br>   space, so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.</br>   The other two times I tried again, but the first time they told me for the</br>   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on</br>   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told</br>   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You were too old?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: What was the age limit?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: 21.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You could not be older than 21?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So if you're above 21 they have another careers, but you cannot get</br>   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but</br>   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.</br>   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again</br>   that was 24 last year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: 24 was the cutoff?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you</br>   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my</br>   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he</br>   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was</br>   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able</br>   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree</br>   that you're working on?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for</br>   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of</br>   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,</br>   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per</br>   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to</br>   Canada.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To Canada?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the</br>   degree.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Can you tell me more about why Canada instead of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to</br>   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US</br>   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this</br>   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with</br>   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go</br>   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or</br>   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that</br>   most people are scared of providing information to the government.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With all it's happening with Trump, no one wants to really give the</br>   extra step.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say</br>   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be</br>   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here</br>   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I</br>   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little</br>   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning</br>   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to</br>   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy</br>   to go back to USA.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I</br>   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your</br>   country if you can, to keep the talented people here. Could you talk more</br>   about that?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they</br>   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on</br>   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the</br>   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the</br>   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not</br>   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican</br>   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So</br>   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the Metro cards?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can</br>   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue</br>   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the</br>   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your</br>   country and using your talents.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that</br>   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless</br>   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're</br>   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some</br>   projects.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just one more</br>   question. Do you consider yourself Mexican or Mexican and American or both?</br>   So, after the time that you spent in the US do you consider a part of</br>   yourself to be American? Or only Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I will say that I consider myself a Mexican who lived in the U.S..</br>   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take</br>   the good things that U.S. leave to me for example, the English and then</br>   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the</br>   bad experience that I had over there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like what? What were some of the bad experiences?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either</br>   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix</br>   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us</br>   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special</br>   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the</br>   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little</br>   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they</br>   were saying that to all of us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to</br>   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all</br>   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one</br>   year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed</br>   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal</br>   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little</br>   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as</br>   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I</br>   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so</br>   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest</br>   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was</br>   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do</br>   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a complaint?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their</br>   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers</br>   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our</br>   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to</br>   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being</br>   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of</br>   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be</br>   affecting you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's awful. I’m sorry...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas</br>   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was</br>   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of</br>   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the</br>   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good</br>   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for first time, there was a</br>   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like</br>   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know</br>   English and they start saying... Can I say for example?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yes, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Literally they were saying, &quot;Oh, look at this Mexicans. They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but</br>   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with American people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can</br>   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to</br>   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I</br>   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start</br>   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal</br>   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I</br>   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a</br>   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I</br>   don't want to talk to a different people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's not an American, but sometimes we're better customer service</br>   that we can provide a better experience. That's why I decided to leave my</br>   mark on their minds, giving them a better customer service so they can know</br>   that we're not bad, that we can help them and we can be on the same</br>   community without being racist. Also, I have bad experience. I can tell you</br>   all my job that sometimes they taught us well, if I can say it...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: &quot;I don’t want to fuck with Mexicans so transfer me to an American</br>   department&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: People say that on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Sometimes they say, &quot;I don't trust Mexicans because Mexicans,</br>   they're criminals. So I don't want to give any of my personal information”.</br>   Even if it's just for payment or just for providing any information,</br>   knowing that they are calling their company, we're not calling them. It's</br>   basically their information is secure with us and it's not just for being</br>   Mexican that I'm going to rob them, but it happens all the time.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: It happens all the time?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Three of ten customers. They'll always do that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's quite a bit. That's a lot of customers.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Is that stressful for you?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's not stressful. It's more like frustrating because we can help</br>   them and it's something so simple because of a closed mind we cannot do our</br>   job sometimes and sometimes we do everything good. They like it, we solve</br>   their problems, but at the end they just finish with a comment saying &quot;fuck</br>   with Mexicans, I don't like this service&quot; and they can switch away…</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's so awful.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's something that we have to deal with it on customer service, but</br>   we are used to it. We have to have a centered mind, we don't [inaudible]</br>   over accelerate with the customer. We always provide a smile, a good</br>   customer service, and everything's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You have to be the one to stay calm even when they're being rude to</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. That's customer service.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The customer is always right. Isn't that what they say?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. But even if they're not, they're always right.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah. Even if they're a jerk. As we start wrapping up here, is</br>   there anything else that you feel like you haven't gotten the chance to say</br>   about your experience as a migrant going to the U.S. coming back? Anything</br>   you want us to understand about you?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I wish that they can be a little bit more easy so we can have a</br>   status that doesn't get us into illegal stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, being crossing as an immigrant instead of crossing on</br>   the flight because it could help them also to get more in more income</br>   instead of just paying a [coyote] so they can cross us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah. So we need some immigration reform to fix the system.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A little.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I agree. I really, really appreciate you coming in and talking and</br>   being so honest about your experiences and I know some of it's</br>   uncomfortable to talk about.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's something that we need sometimes to just throw it out and not</br>   keep it inside.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Good.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's good because I see that you're from over there, so I always</br>   know that I can talk to someone and tell them how I feel because sometimes</br>   they say &quot;fuck off, I don't care&quot;. And on this case you are taking the time</br>   to listen to us, so it's pretty nice.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's our goal to hear from you in your own words and then to</br>   trying to figure out how to get other people, other Americans to have</br>   compassion too and to understand.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="ada5b6d1-cb9b-45f7-be8a-c91247e8165b" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Values">Frank: I will not say compassion because we're not searching for<br>

For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on</br>   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the</br>   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the</br>   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not</br>   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican</br>   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So</br>   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the Metro cards?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can</br>   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue</br>   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the</br>   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your</br>   country and using your talents.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that</br>   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless</br>   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're</br>   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some</br>   projects.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just one more</br>   question. Do you consider yourself Mexican or Mexican and American or both?</br>   So, after the time that you spent in the US do you consider a part of</br>   yourself to be American? Or only Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I will say that I consider myself a Mexican who lived in the U.S..</br>   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take</br>   the good things that U.S. leave to me for example, the English and then</br>   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the</br>   bad experience that I had over there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like what? What were some of the bad experiences?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either</br>   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix</br>   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us</br>   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special</br>   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the</br>   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little</br>   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they</br>   were saying that to all of us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to</br>   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all</br>   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one</br>   year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed</br>   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal</br>   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little</br>   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as</br>   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I</br>   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so</br>   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest</br>   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was</br>   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do</br>   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a complaint?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their</br>   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers</br>   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our</br>   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to</br>   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being</br>   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of</br>   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be</br>   affecting you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's awful. I’m sorry...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas</br>   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was</br>   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of</br>   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the</br>   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good</br>   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for first time, there was a</br>   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like</br>   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know</br>   English and they start saying... Can I say for example?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yes, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Literally they were saying, &quot;Oh, look at this Mexicans. They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but</br>   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with American people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="1921c153-f1a0-483b-b77b-e9f772c6ac11" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Values, Time in the US, Discrimination/stigmatization, Racism">Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can<br>
   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to<br>
   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I<br>
   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start<br>
   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal<br>
   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I<br>
   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a<br>
   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I<br>
   don't want to talk to a different people.<br>

   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be<br>
   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here<br>
   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I<br>
   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little<br>

Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but</br>   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.</br>   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again</br>   that was 24 last year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: 24 was the cutoff?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you</br>   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my</br>   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he</br>   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was</br>   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able</br>   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree</br>   that you're working on?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for</br>   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of</br>   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,</br>   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per</br>   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to</br>   Canada.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To Canada?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the</br>   degree.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Can you tell me more about why Canada instead of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to</br>   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US</br>   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this</br>   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with</br>   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go</br>   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or</br>   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that</br>   most people are scared of providing information to the government.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With all it's happening with Trump, no one wants to really give the</br>   extra step.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say</br>   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be</br>   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here</br>   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I</br>   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little</br>   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning</br>   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to</br>   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy</br>   to go back to USA.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I</br>   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your</br>   country if you can, to keep the talented people here. Could you talk more</br>   about that?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they</br>   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on</br>   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the</br>   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the</br>   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not</br>   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican</br>   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So</br>   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the Metro cards?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can</br>   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue</br>   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the</br>   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your</br>   country and using your talents.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that</br>   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless</br>   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're</br>   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some</br>   projects.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just one more</br>   question. Do you consider yourself Mexican or Mexican and American or both?</br>   So, after the time that you spent in the US do you consider a part of</br>   yourself to be American? Or only Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I will say that I consider myself a Mexican who lived in the U.S..</br>   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take</br>   the good things that U.S. leave to me for example, the English and then</br>   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the</br>   bad experience that I had over there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like what? What were some of the bad experiences?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either</br>   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix</br>   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us</br>   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special</br>   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the</br>   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little</br>   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they</br>   were saying that to all of us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to</br>   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all</br>   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one</br>   year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed</br>   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal</br>   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little</br>   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as</br>   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I</br>   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so</br>   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest</br>   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was</br>   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do</br>   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a complaint?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their</br>   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers</br>   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our</br>   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to</br>   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being</br>   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of</br>   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be</br>   affecting you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's awful. I’m sorry...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas</br>   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was</br>   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of</br>   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the</br>   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good</br>   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for first time, there was a</br>   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like</br>   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know</br>   English and they start saying... Can I say for example?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yes, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Literally they were saying, &quot;Oh, look at this Mexicans. They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but</br>   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with American people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can</br>   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to</br>   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I</br>   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start</br>   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal</br>   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I</br>   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a</br>   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I</br>   don't want to talk to a different people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's not an American, but sometimes we're better customer service</br>   that we can provide a better experience. That's why I decided to leave my</br>   mark on their minds, giving them a better customer service so they can know</br>   that we're not bad, that we can help them and we can be on the same</br>   community without being racist. Also, I have bad experience. I can tell you</br>   all my job that sometimes they taught us well, if I can say it...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: &quot;I don’t want to fuck with Mexicans so transfer me to an American</br>   department&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: People say that on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="956f7594-99e7-4ec4-98ab-bcaca7b83c9d" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Racism, Worst parts">Frank: Sometimes they say, &quot;I don't trust Mexicans because Mexicans,<br>
   they're criminals. So I don't want to give any of my personal information”.<br>

   want to go serve to a country, serve to your country. My brother came on to<br>
   tell us in 2015 and in 2016 that he get into the Mexico army.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Do you still want to join the army here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Actually, I try it four times. I try first for an engineer and<br>
   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I<br>
   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon<br>
   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits<br>
   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve<br>
   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh<br>
   space, so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.<br>
   The other two times I tried again, but the first time they told me for the<br>
   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on<br>
   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told<br>
   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Lizzie: You were too old?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: What was the age limit?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: 21.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You could not be older than 21?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So if you're above 21 they have another careers, but you cannot get</br>   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but</br>   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.</br>   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again</br>   that was 24 last year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: 24 was the cutoff?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you</br>   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my</br>   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he</br>   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was</br>   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able</br>   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree</br>   that you're working on?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for</br>   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of</br>   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,</br>   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per</br>   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to</br>   Canada.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To Canada?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the</br>   degree.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Can you tell me more about why Canada instead of the US?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to</br>   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US</br>   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this</br>   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with</br>   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go</br>   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or</br>   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that</br>   most people are scared of providing information to the government.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: With all it's happening with Trump, no one wants to really give the</br>   extra step.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say</br>   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be</br>   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here</br>   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I</br>   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little</br>   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning</br>   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to</br>   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy</br>   to go back to USA.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I</br>   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your</br>   country if you can, to keep the talented people here. Could you talk more</br>   about that?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they</br>   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on</br>   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the</br>   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the</br>   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not</br>   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican</br>   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So</br>   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have</br>   used the Metro cards?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's</br>   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot</br>   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We</br>   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top</br>   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and</br>   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a</br>   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave</br>   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can</br>   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue</br>   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the</br>   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to</br>   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark</br>   here on Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your</br>   country and using your talents.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that</br>   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless</br>   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're</br>   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some</br>   projects.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just one more</br>   question. Do you consider yourself Mexican or Mexican and American or both?</br>   So, after the time that you spent in the US do you consider a part of</br>   yourself to be American? Or only Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I will say that I consider myself a Mexican who lived in the U.S..</br>   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take</br>   the good things that U.S. leave to me for example, the English and then</br>   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the</br>   bad experience that I had over there.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like what? What were some of the bad experiences?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either</br>   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix</br>   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us</br>   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special</br>   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the</br>   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The white kids?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little</br>   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they</br>   were saying that to all of us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to</br>   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all</br>   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one</br>   year.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed</br>   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal</br>   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little</br>   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as</br>   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I</br>   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so</br>   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest</br>   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was</br>   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do</br>   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Like a complaint?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their</br>   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers</br>   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our</br>   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to</br>   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being</br>   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of</br>   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be</br>   affecting you.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's awful. I’m sorry...</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas</br>   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was</br>   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of</br>   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the</br>   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good</br>   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for first time, there was a</br>   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like</br>   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know</br>   English and they start saying... Can I say for example?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yes, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Literally they were saying, &quot;Oh, look at this Mexicans. They'll</br>   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a</br>   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but</br>   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,</br>   instead of being with American people.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel</br>   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,</br>   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I</br>   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my</br>   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special</br>   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix</br>   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's</br>   another bad experience I had.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my</br>   language.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the</br>   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were</br>   treated?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can</br>   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to</br>   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I</br>   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start</br>   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal</br>   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I</br>   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a</br>   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I</br>   don't want to talk to a different people.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: That's not an American, but sometimes we're better customer service</br>   that we can provide a better experience. That's why I decided to leave my</br>   mark on their minds, giving them a better customer service so they can know</br>   that we're not bad, that we can help them and we can be on the same</br>   community without being racist. Also, I have bad experience. I can tell you</br>   all my job that sometimes they taught us well, if I can say it...</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: &quot;I don’t want to fuck with Mexicans so transfer me to an American</br>   department&quot;.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: People say that on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Sometimes they say, &quot;I don't trust Mexicans because Mexicans,</br>   they're criminals. So I don't want to give any of my personal information”.</br>   Even if it's just for payment or just for providing any information,</br>   knowing that they are calling their company, we're not calling them. It's</br>   basically their information is secure with us and it's not just for being</br>   Mexican that I'm going to rob them, but it happens all the time.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: It happens all the time?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Three of ten customers. They'll always do that.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's quite a bit. That's a lot of customers.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Is that stressful for you?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's not stressful. It's more like frustrating because we can help</br>   them and it's something so simple because of a closed mind we cannot do our</br>   job sometimes and sometimes we do everything good. They like it, we solve</br>   their problems, but at the end they just finish with a comment saying &quot;fuck</br>   with Mexicans, I don't like this service&quot; and they can switch away…</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's so awful.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's something that we have to deal with it on customer service, but</br>   we are used to it. We have to have a centered mind, we don't [inaudible]</br>   over accelerate with the customer. We always provide a smile, a good</br>   customer service, and everything's okay.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: You have to be the one to stay calm even when they're being rude to</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. That's customer service.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: The customer is always right. Isn't that what they say?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Yeah. But even if they're not, they're always right.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah. Even if they're a jerk. As we start wrapping up here, is</br>   there anything else that you feel like you haven't gotten the chance to say</br>   about your experience as a migrant going to the U.S. coming back? Anything</br>   you want us to understand about you?</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I wish that they can be a little bit more easy so we can have a</br>   status that doesn't get us into illegal stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: For example, being crossing as an immigrant instead of crossing on</br>   the flight because it could help them also to get more in more income</br>   instead of just paying a [coyote] so they can cross us.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Yeah. So we need some immigration reform to fix the system.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: A little.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: I agree. I really, really appreciate you coming in and talking and</br>   being so honest about your experiences and I know some of it's</br>   uncomfortable to talk about.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's something that we need sometimes to just throw it out and not</br>   keep it inside.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: Good.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: It's good because I see that you're from over there, so I always</br>   know that I can talk to someone and tell them how I feel because sometimes</br>   they say &quot;fuck off, I don't care&quot;. And on this case you are taking the time</br>   to listen to us, so it's pretty nice.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That's our goal to hear from you in your own words and then to</br>   trying to figure out how to get other people, other Americans to have</br>   compassion too and to understand.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: I will not say compassion because we're not searching for</br>   compassion, what we are searching is just to be treated as well.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: As equals.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: As equal because compassion you are feeling bad.</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: When I say compassion, I don't mean feeling bad, but understanding.</br> </br> </br>   Frank: Understanding, it's a better word, yeah. Anything else?</br> </br> </br>   Lizzie: That is all.</br> </div><\p>
