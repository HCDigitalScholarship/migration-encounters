   Lizzie: One thing that I want to hear about that you mentioned in the<br>
   survey was that you had a chance to go to the White House and you weren't<br>
   able to. Could you tell me that story?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yes. When I was in fifth grade, I always saw these kids that have<br>
   their patrol flex and I told my counselor that I wanted to be a patrol.<br>
   They told me that I can join this patrol and they put me on proof. I was<br>
   doing really well. I had these trips to the Mall of America and one of the<br>
   scenarios, I remember Ms. _______, it was on my _____ School and she<br>
   offered me if I wanted to go make an essay because there was a how can you<br>
   say – there was a program where they said that we can get in contact to go<br>
   and visit the White House because I wanted to learn a little bit more about<br>
   the culture.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: So, I make my essay in Spanish. She helped me for around three<br>
   months to get all of the essay translated to English. She also was helping<br>
   me making my essay. I remember that it was around 800 words. We had to<br>
   write out, so I make my effort. She helped me send all the forms and two or<br>
   three weeks after, I received a letter. It was coming also with the stamp<br>
   the color gold and because on those times I was not really getting into the<br>
   English.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: I brought it to her and to see if she can translate it for me and<br>
   she was telling me, actually she didn't want it to hurt my feelings, so she<br>
   started telling me in other words that I didn't qualify because there was<br>
   things missing on the essay, but now that I can understand it, I can see<br>
   that because of my immigration status I was not able to qualify for the<br>
   visit to the White House. So I still have the envelope, as a memory, and I<br>
   have all those papers. Basically with all my information, they were telling<br>
   me that because my immigration status, I cannot go to the White House.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Just because of your immigration status.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: I remember since that day I decided not to participate in any<br>
   program because I know that I was not going to be able because of my<br>
   immigration status so I make my own goals. They were still learning English<br>
   and get back here to Mexico so I can continue to study because she also<br>
   told me when I was in junior high - I frequently went to visit her - and<br>
   she told me that I needed to think about it if I want to continue with the<br>
   University because the patrol stuff that I was doing, it was going to give<br>
   me points so I can get into the University, but I wasn't going to be able<br>
   to get enough points. I needed to pay like a monthly charge and it was<br>
   going to be a really expensive. So, she offered it to me that we can<br>
   continue, try to see if we can get any type of help so you can continue<br>
   studying and also my parents offered me if I wanted came back to Mexico<br>
   because I wanted to get into the Army, but they told me that if I want to<br>
   serve to country that I should serve to my country. So that's another<br>
   reason why I also come back to Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Did you think about serving in the Army in the U.S. or in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Actually, this get into my mind because my brother when he was on<br>
   the senior high, he got this paper saying that he wanted to serve but it<br>
   was just a copy, not the hard copy. My dad just break it off and say if you<br>
   want to go serve to a country, serve to your country. My brother came on to<br>
   tell us in 2015 and in 2016 that he get into the Mexico army.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Do you still want to join the army here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Actually, I try it four times. I try first for an engineer and<br>
   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I<br>
   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon<br>
   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits<br>
   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve<br>
   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh<br>
   space, so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.<br>
   The other two times I tried again, but the first time they told me for the<br>
   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on<br>
   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told<br>
   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: You were too old?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: What was the age limit?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: 21.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: You could not be older than 21?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: That's correct.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Wow.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: So if you're above 21 they have another careers, but you cannot get<br>
   an engineer. Also, I try it on the same period, I try it for aviation, but<br>
   because I don’t have a 20/20 [vision] on my eyes I was not able to qualify.<br>
   On the third one I tried for medicine again, but I was above the age again<br>
   that was 24 last year.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: 24 was the cutoff?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: That's correct.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Wow. A lot of age cutoffs there that they really want young people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah. It's because it's a long term career. Once you get out you<br>
   have to pay the service and you start getting a lot of ranks.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: So I was planning to get a career over there and on the case, my<br>
   incentive was my brother because he wanted to join the Marines, but once he<br>
   get here on Mexico, he went to a [paratrooper unit] and basically he was<br>
   from the Air Army, so I wanted to join the same steps. But I wasn't able<br>
   to. So I decided to continue with my University and here I am.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: So what are your plans for your future with this engineering degree<br>
   that you're working on?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: With this engineering degree basically, since it's more for<br>
   communications and electronic, at this moment I'm doing an extra course of<br>
   programming so I can learn a little another specialty and between my goals,<br>
   it's either get a good job here that is worth talking about 25,000 per<br>
   month. If not, I'm planning to make all my migration status to go to<br>
   Canada.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: To Canada?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah. I was also viewing all their requirements, but they need the<br>
   degree.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Can you tell me more about why Canada instead of the US?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to<br>
   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US<br>
   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this<br>
   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with<br>
   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go<br>
   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or<br>
   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that<br>
   most people are scared of providing information to the government.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: With all it's happening with Trump, no one wants to really give the<br>
   extra step.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Nobody wants to be the sponsor for the visa.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say<br>
   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be<br>
   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here<br>
   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I<br>
   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little<br>
   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning<br>
   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to<br>
   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy<br>
   to go back to USA.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: You had said something in the survey that was interesting that I<br>
   want to go back to and that you mentioned now about wanting to help your<br>
   country if you can, to keep the talented people here. Could you talk more<br>
   about that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they<br>
   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on<br>
   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the<br>
   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the<br>
   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not<br>
   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican<br>
   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So<br>
   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have<br>
   used the Metro cards?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Yep.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's<br>
   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot<br>
   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We<br>
   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top<br>
   quad for the roofing like…Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and<br>
   we're working in developing on it…It's something that at this moment, as a<br>
   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave<br>
   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can<br>
   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue<br>
   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Sure.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: La technica al servicio de la patria. It means that all the<br>
   technicians, all the engineers we serve to our country. So I want to<br>
   continue with that spirit and, yeah, like I was telling you leave my mark<br>
   here on Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: I like that. Yeah, it's patriotic in a good way to help your<br>
   country and using your talents.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah, we're making a lot of other steps for example, we know that<br>
   you're ahead on the wireless charges, but we were thinking on a wireless<br>
   electricity, like Nikola Tesla, we have a lot of great minds that we're<br>
   taking all those ideas and we wanted to improve it. So, there are some<br>
   projects.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: That's very cool. That's very inspiring. I have just one more<br>
   question. Do you consider yourself Mexican or Mexican and American or both?<br>
   So, after the time that you spent in the US do you consider a part of<br>
   yourself to be American? Or only Mexican.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: I will say that I consider myself a Mexican who lived in the U.S..<br>
   That is the way I can consider myself because I had the experience, I take<br>
   the good things that U.S. leave to me for example, the English and then<br>
   taking all the advantage of it and I just want to keep on my mind all the<br>
   bad experience that I had over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Like what? What were some of the bad experiences?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either<br>
   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix<br>
   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us<br>
   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special<br>
   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the<br>
   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: The white kids?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little<br>
   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they<br>
   were saying that to all of us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to<br>
   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all<br>
   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one<br>
   year.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Actually, when I gave my … They were telling me that I just needed<br>
   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal<br>
   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little<br>
   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as<br>
   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I<br>
   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so<br>
   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest<br>
   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was<br>
   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes… how do<br>
   you say… saying that there was not delivered their paper.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Like a complaint?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their<br>
   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers<br>
   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our<br>
   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to<br>
   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being<br>
   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of<br>
   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be<br>
   affecting you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: That's awful. I’m sorry...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Well, other good things I can tell you is, for example, on Christmas<br>
   we were leaving the letter wishing to everyone Happy Holidays and there was<br>
   a lot of letters get into our home because I sent it to the warehouse of<br>
   the newspaper and they sent it to our home or they give it to us on the<br>
   newspaper warehouse with gift cards. A lot of compliments and that's a good<br>
   experience I had. Also, when I went to the zoo for first time, there was a<br>
   lot of people really trying to get us into the community and not like<br>
   rejecting us. Also, there was comments that they think that we don't know<br>
   English and they start saying... Can I say for example?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Yes, you can say.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Literally they were saying, "Oh, look at this Mexicans. They'll<br>
   never know what they’re fucking doing here. They should be on a gauge".<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: So there was those racist comments. I know that I was not on a<br>
   Latino community area because Minnesota, there is not a lot of Latinos, but<br>
   there was a lot of African people and Thailand. They were my friends,<br>
   instead of being with American people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Did you feel accepted by the community overall?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Actually, when I was on _____, it was my elementary school, I feel<br>
   accepted and they were going to transfer me to ____ Junior High School,<br>
   it's more for an African American community and so we moved from home and I<br>
   was going to go to _____, that was an American community and I talked to my<br>
   counselor and they talked to the district and they make a special<br>
   [decision] so I can go to a different district that was more for mix<br>
   communities because I didn't want to go to ____. Yeah basically, that's<br>
   another bad experience I had.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: I'm so sorry. That's really awful. That's fucked up. Excuse my<br>
   language.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Do you still feel, or did you feel any level of anger towards the<br>
   country as a whole or towards American people because of how you were<br>
   treated?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can<br>
   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to<br>
   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I<br>
   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start<br>
   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal<br>
   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I<br>
   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a<br>
   straight mind[set] saying that I don’t want to talk to a Mexican and I<br>
   don't want to talk to a different people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: That's not an American, but sometimes we're better customer service<br>
   that we can provide a better experience. That's why I decided to leave my<br>
   mark on their minds, giving them a better customer service so they can know<br>
   that we're not bad, that we can help them and we can be on the same<br>
   community without being racist. Also, I have bad experience. I can tell you<br>
   all my job that sometimes they taught us well, if I can say it...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Sure.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: "I don’t want to fuck with Mexicans so transfer me to an American<br>
   department".<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: People say that on the phone?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Wow.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Sometimes they say, "I don't trust Mexicans because Mexicans,<br>
   they're criminals. So I don't want to give any of my personal information”.<br>
   Even if it's just for payment or just for providing any information,<br>
   knowing that they are calling their company, we're not calling them. It's<br>
   basically their information is secure with us and it's not just for being<br>
   Mexican that I'm going to rob them, but it happens all the time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: It happens all the time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Three of ten customers. They'll always do that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: That's quite a bit. That's a lot of customers.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Is that stressful for you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: It's not stressful. It's more like frustrating because we can help<br>
   them and it's something so simple because of a closed mind we cannot do our<br>
   job sometimes and sometimes we do everything good. They like it, we solve<br>
   their problems, but at the end they just finish with a comment saying "fuck<br>
   with Mexicans, I don't like this service" and they can switch away…<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: That's so awful.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: It's something that we have to deal with it on customer service, but<br>
   we are used to it. We have to have a centered mind, we don't [inaudible]<br>
   over accelerate with the customer. We always provide a smile, a good<br>
   customer service, and everything's okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: You have to be the one to stay calm even when they're being rude to<br>
   you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah. That's customer service.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: The customer is always right. Isn't that what they say?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Yeah. But even if they're not, they're always right.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Yeah. Even if they're a jerk. As we start wrapping up here, is<br>
   there anything else that you feel like you haven't gotten the chance to say<br>
   about your experience as a migrant going to the U.S. coming back? Anything<br>
   you want us to understand about you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: I wish that they can be a little bit more easy so we can have a<br>
   status that doesn't get us into illegal stuff.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: For example, being crossing as an immigrant instead of crossing on<br>
   the flight because it could help them also to get more in more income<br>
   instead of just paying a [coyote] so they can cross us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Yeah. So we need some immigration reform to fix the system.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: A little.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: I agree. I really, really appreciate you coming in and talking and<br>
   being so honest about your experiences and I know some of it's<br>
   uncomfortable to talk about.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: It's something that we need sometimes to just throw it out and not<br>
   keep it inside.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: Good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: It's good because I see that you're from over there, so I always<br>
   know that I can talk to someone and tell them how I feel because sometimes<br>
   they say "fuck off, I don't care". And on this case you are taking the time<br>
   to listen to us, so it's pretty nice.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: That's our goal to hear from you in your own words and then to<br>
   trying to figure out how to get other people, other Americans to have<br>
   compassion too and to understand.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: I will not say compassion because we're not searching for<br>
   compassion, what we are searching is just to be treated as well.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: As equals.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: As equal because compassion you are feeling bad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: When I say compassion, I don't mean feeling bad, but understanding.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Frank: Understanding, it's a better word, yeah. Anything else?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Lizzie: That is all.<br>
