I'm here with <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">ten</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Robert</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">ten</span>, on</br>   recorder <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">number five</span>, starting the interview. Okay <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>, so the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   question I want to ask you is why did your family leave <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   place?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Okay, well my family leave <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>…well like I mentioned, we had</br>   some economic issues over there. Plus my mom also, he got separated, my</br>   dad, so she needed to start from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">zero</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: At what age did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: What age did I leave? I leaved at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">around three years</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span></br>   old. If I'm not mistaken.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Three years old</span>. And what's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> memories in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: My <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> memories hmm…well, I don't know the place, every time</br>   that I try to picture <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>, I picture like the streets, the</br>   places, the cars, everything, like most the streets, clean, I don't know,</br>   clean. That's how I picture the States.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Do you have like a memory that really sticks out, that you feel</br>   like this is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span>? Or this is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Oh well, the houses, the school, the product you know. Like when I</br>   say product, I mean the candies, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">the Hot Cheetos,</span> and all that. The</br>   burgers, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">McDonald</span>'s, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: When your family left, you said your mom separated from your dad?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Who else did your family leave behind?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, right? Well, my mom left behind like most of my family.</br>   Most of my family is in here. Like my mom's grandma, a lot of my uncles,</br>   that it will be uncles or aunts of my mom. How do you say? Well yeah, like</br>   I mentioned most of the family she left here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Was it hard for her?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, of course because my mom had the support of my family. And</br>   well, when she came here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, yeah well, it's difficult. Like I</br>   mentioned, I think it's difficult when you're in a different country where</br>   you don't know nothing, not even the language, and it's difficult, and</br>   trying to raise <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> kids.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Like I mean, she did had support of my grandma, but the</br>   relationship of my mom and my grandma wasn't too good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So when you got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, what do you remember from the</br>   school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: The teachers. The teachers, and well the classrooms, the</br>   playground, and... How do you say? Mis compañeros?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: School? Peers?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: The peers?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah that's what I remember there, yeah. And it was good. I liked</br>   the school over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: When you were there, did you always know you were undocumented, or</br>   was there a day that you realized-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: No. I never knew that I was... never knew, since like when I came</br>   here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, my dad told me. I thought like we did have you know</br>   documents to be there, but then he told me, &quot;No&quot; like, &quot;You were there</br>   illegal.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So what happened when you were there, living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>,</br>   you were living with your mom, your siblings. What was your house like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: It was apartment, it was a small apartment. I lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Cali</span> and</br>   L.A. and it was hot. Those temperatures, when it's cold, it gets very cold,</br>   and when it's hot, it gets very hot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Yeah I know, I'm from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Pomona</span>, so right there next to...not next to,</br>   but like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">30 minutes</span> away from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">North Hollywood</span>. It gets very hot. From</br>   there, what age did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: What age? I leaved like, let’s see, at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the age of like…</span>13.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span>. What was that like for you when you were leaving? Why</br>   did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well I had issues, you know. In school I was flunking subjects. I</br>   wasn't doing pretty much well in school, I had issues with my mom I used to</br>   argue a lot with her, and addiction problems.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Addiction to what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Marijuana, Cannabis, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: At <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span>? Or like before?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: No like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12, 13</span>, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Well what do you think like made you-?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Nah well you know hanging with the big guys you want to feel big,</br>   and just do stupid stuff…Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Who were the big guys?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well some people that, well, I used to hang out in the</br>   neighborhood. Like they were like what? If I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span> right there, or 12,</br>   those guys were like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15, 16</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Did you see them as friends?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Did you see them as like your friends, or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Some of them, yeah. I did have friends in school as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So what do you think made you like attracted to smoking, or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I don't know, I think problems in my house. It's pretty difficult,</br>   grew up with no... How you say? With father. It's pretty difficult.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Yeah, that makes me think a lot about how I grew up, because I also</br>   grew up without a dad, and-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: And it was pretty [inaudible] because... How do you say you like,</br>   figura paterna?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: I don't know [crosstalk <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:07:51</span>].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well, I didn't grow up with that. And I started like to look for</br>   that you know… figure with my brother's dad. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: This is your stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: My brother's... Yeah, my stepdad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You think he provided that support, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I don't know, it was like really bad, like trying see that your</br>   little brother has a father and everything, you know. Like he shows him</br>   love and everything, and me on the inside, I was like, &quot;Fuck man, I wish I</br>   can had a dad like that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: And this is while you were in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. Where was your dad?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, working.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Did you have contact with him?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: How often would you like talk to him, or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: And right now, we talk super great. But when I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, he</br>   like what, once a year he used to come.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Do you feel like that was enough?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: No, of course not, that's not enough.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So when you left when you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span>, because you were having</br>   problems.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You mentioned you didn't know you were undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: When did you find out? Was it-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Like at what age, or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: What age.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">several years</span>, like when I began living with my dad,</br>   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about</br>   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were</br>   supposed to go like to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">Disneyland</span>, and well we stayed there. We didn't</br>   return to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So before that, did you always think you were a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen? Or what</br>   did you think?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of</br>   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,</br>   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the</br>   flag, and sing the... It's called-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Pledge of Allegiance.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, to the flag of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States of America</span>. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Do you remember how it goes?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: No, I just remember that part, &quot;<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Pledge Allegiance</span> to the flag of</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States of America</span>.&quot; And that's that. When I was in elementary,</br>   yeah, lo sabía todo. I used to know it all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought</br>   you were different, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you</br>   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that</br>   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going</br>   through your mind?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Oh like, &quot;Damn. For real?&quot; I was like, I don't know, yeah, I</br>   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a</br>   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was</br>   born in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when</br>   I came here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You thought you were going to be here just for a little bit and</br>   then go back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: For a while, not for a little bit, but I thought I was only going</br>   to be for a while. But when I came here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, well, I realized that</br>   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well</br>   if my whole family is here, well, I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. But I could have family over</br>   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I</br>   have here, and the family that I have in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. The family that I have in</br>   US is only my grandma and like some of my uncles. And I have my whole</br>   family here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So you're okay living right here, or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I like it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You weren't sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I'm sorry?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Were you sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well yeah, my mom told me that we're not going back to the States.</br>   And well, like I have a younger brother who was born over there as well.</br>   And well, my mom was also having some legal problems with my little</br>   brother, and his father. You can say that that's another reason why we</br>   returned.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So she was having legal troubles too, with the other-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: With my stepbrother, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: And he's a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: The brother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Did he stay over there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: No, he's here-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: He came back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: ... yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Was it because your stepfather was aggressive, or what kind of</br>   legal troubles?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: No the... What's it called? Custody, of the child, my brother.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Your mom got it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I suppose, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So have you felt welcomed back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, with my family, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: How about outside?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Outside? Well I don't know, it was kind of different because when</br>   we came back, we came back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Xochimilco</span>. So…we were like in this town,</br>   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No</br>   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird</br>   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only</br>   white kid, I was, and it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully</br>   you for that, or like what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know. Yeah, ya sabes dos</br>   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I</br>   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that</br>   as well. But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I</br>   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So how about now? Fast forward to now, how do you feel?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I feel pretty good. Thinking how all that has changed, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Do you feel like you want to stay here now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, well…you know at the beginning it was hard because, like I</br>   mentioned, I think the States, well like since you're in the city you see</br>   everything more cleaner, right? Like I mean in general, like people,</br>   police, schools, houses, streets. And here, well it was different. It was</br>   different. Like you get, how do you say? Te acostumbras ya de algo. How you</br>   can say that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You got used to something?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, you get used to something. So when you are used to something</br>   and then you change to a different environment, well it is kind of hard.</br>   But you adapt yourself at the long time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: How do you think the living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> has shaped who you are?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well, let's see, well, culture I think, yeah. The culture from</br>   over there and the culture from here. I think it makes me have a more open</br>   mind. Yeah, we can see that we're, yeah. It shaped me like to a person that</br>   has his mind open, he's always sees the good and the bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Do you have anything else that you think you want to say about</br>   being in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, or being here, that you feel like people should know?</br>   Whether it's a good experience, a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Well, yeah sure. Like when you get to a country that you don't</br>   know, like trust me it does get hard, it's hard. But you'll get used to it.</br>   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my</br>   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think</br>   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one</br>   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard</br>   to get the food in the table.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to</br>   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to</br>   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is</br>   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If</br>   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in</br>   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,</br>   really, really hard. And in this case in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, well, I think</br>   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's</br>   what I always think.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You play video games?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, I like video games.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: It sounds like you play <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Halo</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Halo, yeah I used to play <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Halo</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So you-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I am more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">PlayStation</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Halo</span> a lot, I like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Halo</span>, and</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Battlefield</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Oh well when they came out, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at</br>   E3.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Oh yeah?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Oh yes, do you know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="EVENT">the E3 Conference</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: It's happening <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next week</span> or something. Sorry, what were you saying?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Oh yeah yeah. Yeah I used to play just one of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> of</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Halo</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: That one was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah, yeah-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: That was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: ... and you can add <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> guns. That was pretty dope.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So, I'm trying to think. There was another question but I kind</br>   of... Do you still, I know you mentioned like maybe addiction…do you still</br>   struggle with addiction now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I</br>   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, man it's</br>   hard, and when you know that a 13-year-old kid doing drugs and all that,</br>   think it was pretty hard for my mom.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: But like, well, I think by the time I have learned the good</br>   things, and the bad things. So I think, I always say that if you have</br>   everything on the limit, you should be fine.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Yeah. But when my mom catch me, all that stuff, like it was really</br>   hard. No, there was no trust anymore. And it was, if I wanted it to go this</br>   side, &quot;No, you cannot go because you're going to do your stuff.&quot; Yeah it</br>   was difficult. But you know right now, I'm doing fine. I think I've learned</br>   to keep that balance.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Okay. Well thank you so much for your time. I think those are all</br>   the questions I have. More might come up later. But what do you think you</br>   would have done if you would've stayed in the States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I don't know. Well, probably end up in jail, get deported, most</br>   likely.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You haven't been-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: Or-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: ... in jail here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: In jail here? Not jail-jail, but yeah, like how do you say?</br>   …[Inaudible <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:23:35</span>]? they just, I was like arguing with a police and that</br>   police got pissed off. He did hit me. [foreign language <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">00:23:49</span>]. And well</br>   he... is not, how do you say, is not jail-jail. It's like they just keep</br>   you in a room for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">37 hours</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Three days</span>. Yeah. Luckily, I was like, well, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a   day and a half</span>. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Did they give you food and water, or no?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>: I had to call my family to provide me with that. But nah. Like at</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, yeah, they gave me water, yeah. But then they wanted me to call my</br>   mom in so they can provide me with, I don't know, with my needs. But there</br>   was one time that when I got caught, there was a dude, he was more time</br>   there than me. So he saw that one of the police guys, or the people that</br>   are doing the scripts and the paperwork, they tienen sus garnachas their</br>   tacos, and everything. He was like, &quot;Hey hey, can you give me, I haven't</br>   ate anything. I haven't ate anything.&quot; And Se porto buena onda, he gave him</br>   his food. And that was fine, nobody I think wants to give their food to a</br>   fucking criminal. But yeah. Like he didn't ask for... I didn't ask for</br>   water, because I didn't need it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Okay. Okay, but yeah, thanks for your time, again. I appreciate it,</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Roberto</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Economic, Opportunity, Family reunification">Sergio: So my name is Sergio. I'm here with Roberto ten, Robert ten, on   recorder number five, starting the interview. Okay Roberto, so the first   question I want to ask you is why did your family leave Mexico in the first   place?     Roberto: Okay, well my family leave Mexico…well like I mentioned, we had   some economic issues over there. Plus my mom also, he got separated, my   dad, so she needed to start from zero.    </span> Sergio: At what age did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: What age did I leave? I leaved at around three years, three years</br>   old. If I'm not mistaken.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Three years old. And what's one of your first memories in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: My first memories hmm…well, I don't know the place, every time</br>   that I try to picture United States, I picture like the streets, the</br>   places, the cars, everything, like most the streets, clean, I don't know,</br>   clean. That's how I picture the States.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you have like a memory that really sticks out, that you feel</br>   like this is America? Or this is the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh well, the houses, the school, the product you know. Like when I</br>   say product, I mean the candies, the Hot Cheetos, and all that. The</br>   burgers, McDonald's, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When your family left, you said your mom separated from your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Who else did your family leave behind?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: In Mexico, right? Well, my mom left behind like most of my family.</br>   Most of my family is in here. Like my mom's grandma, a lot of my uncles,</br>   that it will be uncles or aunts of my mom. How do you say? Well yeah, like</br>   I mentioned most of the family she left here.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was it hard for her?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, of course because my mom had the support of my family. And</br>   well, when she came here in Mexico, yeah well, it's difficult. Like I</br>   mentioned, I think it's difficult when you're in a different country where</br>   you don't know nothing, not even the language, and it's difficult, and</br>   trying to raise three kids.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Like I mean, she did had support of my grandma, but the</br>   relationship of my mom and my grandma wasn't too good.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So when you got to the United States, what do you remember from the</br>   school?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: The teachers. The teachers, and well the classrooms, the</br>   playground, and... How do you say? Mis compañeros?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: School? Peers?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: The peers?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah that's what I remember there, yeah. And it was good. I liked</br>   the school over there.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When you were there, did you always know you were undocumented, or</br>   was there a day that you realized-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No. I never knew that I was... never knew, since like when I came</br>   here to Mexico, my dad told me. I thought like we did have you know</br>   documents to be there, but then he told me, &quot;No&quot; like, &quot;You were there</br>   illegal.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So what happened when you were there, living in the United States,</br>   you were living with your mom, your siblings. What was your house like?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: It was apartment, it was a small apartment. I lived in Cali and</br>   L.A. and it was hot. Those temperatures, when it's cold, it gets very cold,</br>   and when it's hot, it gets very hot.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah I know, I'm from Pomona, so right there next to...not next to,</br>   but like 30 minutes away from North Hollywood. It gets very hot. From</br>   there, what age did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: What age? I leaved like, let’s see, at the age of like…13.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were 13. What was that like for you when you were leaving? Why</br>   did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well I had issues, you know. In school I was flunking subjects. I</br>   wasn't doing pretty much well in school, I had issues with my mom I used to</br>   argue a lot with her, and addiction problems.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Addiction to what?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Marijuana, Cannabis, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: At 13? Or like before?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No like 12, 13, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Well what do you think like made you-?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Nah well you know hanging with the big guys you want to feel big,</br>   and just do stupid stuff…Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Who were the big guys?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well some people that, well, I used to hang out in the</br>   neighborhood. Like they were like what? If I was 13 right there, or 12,</br>   those guys were like 15, 16.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you see them as friends?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you see them as like your friends, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Some of them, yeah. I did have friends in school as well.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So what do you think made you like attracted to smoking, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know, I think problems in my house. It's pretty difficult,</br>   grew up with no... How you say? With father. It's pretty difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah, that makes me think a lot about how I grew up, because I also</br>   grew up without a dad, and-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And it was pretty [inaudible] because... How do you say you like,</br>   figura paterna?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: I don't know [crosstalk 00:07:51].</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, I didn't grow up with that. And I started like to look for</br>   that you know… figure with my brother's dad. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: This is your stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: My brother's... Yeah, my stepdad.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You think he provided that support, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know, it was like really bad, like trying see that your</br>   little brother has a father and everything, you know. Like he shows him</br>   love and everything, and me on the inside, I was like, &quot;Fuck man, I wish I</br>   can had a dad like that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And this is while you were in the US. Where was your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mexico, working.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have contact with him?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How often would you like talk to him, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And right now, we talk super great. But when I was in States, he</br>   like what, once a year he used to come.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like that was enough?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, of course not, that's not enough.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So when you left when you were 13, because you were having</br>   problems.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You mentioned you didn't know you were undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When did you find out? Was it-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Like at what age, or?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What age.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well like several years, like when I began living with my dad,</br>   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about</br>   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were</br>   supposed to go like to Disneyland, and well we stayed there. We didn't</br>   return to Mexico, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So before that, did you always think you were a US citizen? Or what</br>   did you think?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of</br>   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,</br>   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the</br>   flag, and sing the... It's called-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Pledge of Allegiance.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, to the flag of the United States of America. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you remember how it goes?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, I just remember that part, &quot;Pledge Allegiance to the flag of</br>   the United States of America.&quot; And that's that. When I was in elementary,</br>   yeah, lo sabía todo. I used to know it all.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought</br>   you were different, right?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you</br>   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that</br>   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going</br>   through your mind?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh like, &quot;Damn. For real?&quot; I was like, I don't know, yeah, I</br>   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a</br>   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was</br>   born in Mexico. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when</br>   I came here to Mexico, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You thought you were going to be here just for a little bit and</br>   then go back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: For a while, not for a little bit, but I thought I was only going</br>   to be for a while. But when I came here to Mexico, well, I realized that</br>   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well</br>   if my whole family is here, well, I'm Mexican. But I could have family over</br>   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I</br>   have here, and the family that I have in the US. The family that I have in</br>   US is only my grandma and like some of my uncles. And I have my whole</br>   family here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you're okay living right here, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I like it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You weren't sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I'm sorry?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Were you sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, my mom told me that we're not going back to the States.</br>   And well, like I have a younger brother who was born over there as well.</br>   And well, my mom was also having some legal problems with my little</br>   brother, and his father. You can say that that's another reason why we</br>   returned.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So she was having legal troubles too, with the other-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: With my stepbrother, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And he's a US citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: The brother?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did he stay over there?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, he's here-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: He came back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was it because your stepfather was aggressive, or what kind of</br>   legal troubles?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No the... What's it called? Custody, of the child, my brother.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Your mom got it?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I suppose, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So have you felt welcomed back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, with my family, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How about outside?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Outside? Well I don't know, it was kind of different because when</br>   we came back, we came back to Xochimilco. So…we were like in this town,</br>   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No</br>   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird</br>   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only</br>   white kid, I was, and it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully</br>   you for that, or like what?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know. Yeah, ya sabes dos</br>   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I</br>   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that</br>   as well. But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I</br>   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So how about now? Fast forward to now, how do you feel?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I feel pretty good. Thinking how all that has changed, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like you want to stay here now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, well…you know at the beginning it was hard because, like I</br>   mentioned, I think the States, well like since you're in the city you see</br>   everything more cleaner, right? Like I mean in general, like people,</br>   police, schools, houses, streets. And here, well it was different. It was</br>   different. Like you get, how do you say? Te acostumbras ya de algo. How you</br>   can say that?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You got used to something?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, you get used to something. So when you are used to something</br>   and then you change to a different environment, well it is kind of hard.</br>   But you adapt yourself at the long time.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How do you think the living in the US has shaped who you are?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, let's see, well, culture I think, yeah. The culture from</br>   over there and the culture from here. I think it makes me have a more open</br>   mind. Yeah, we can see that we're, yeah. It shaped me like to a person that</br>   has his mind open, he's always sees the good and the bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you have anything else that you think you want to say about</br>   being in the US, or being here, that you feel like people should know?</br>   Whether it's a good experience, a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, yeah sure. Like when you get to a country that you don't</br>   know, like trust me it does get hard, it's hard. But you'll get used to it.</br>   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my</br>   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think</br>   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one</br>   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard</br>   to get the food in the table.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to</br>   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to</br>   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is</br>   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If</br>   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in</br>   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,</br>   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think</br>   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful</br>   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's</br>   what I always think.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You play video games?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I like video games.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It sounds like you play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Halo, yeah I used to play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I am more PlayStation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play Halo a lot, I like Halo, and</br>   Battlefield.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh well when they came out, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at</br>   E3.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh yes, do you know the E3 Conference?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It's happening next week or something. Sorry, what were you saying?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah yeah. Yeah I used to play just one of the first two of</br>   Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That one was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... and you can add two guns. That was pretty dope.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, I'm trying to think. There was another question but I kind</br>   of... Do you still, I know you mentioned like maybe addiction…do you still</br>   struggle with addiction now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I</br>   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the States, man it's</br>   hard, and when you know that a 13-year-old kid doing drugs and all that,</br>   think it was pretty hard for my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: But like, well, I think by the time I have learned the good</br>   things, and the bad things. So I think, I always say that if you have</br>   everything on the limit, you should be fine.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah. But when my mom catch me, all that stuff, like it was really</br>   hard. No, there was no trust anymore. And it was, if I wanted it to go this</br>   side, &quot;No, you cannot go because you're going to do your stuff.&quot; Yeah it</br>   was difficult. But you know right now, I'm doing fine. I think I've learned</br>   to keep that balance.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay. Well thank you so much for your time. I think those are all</br>   the questions I have. More might come up later. But what do you think you</br>   would have done if you would've stayed in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know. Well, probably end up in jail, get deported, most</br>   likely.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You haven't been-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Or-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: ... in jail here?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: In jail here? Not jail-jail, but yeah, like how do you say?</br>   …[Inaudible 00:23:35]? they just, I was like arguing with a police and that</br>   police got pissed off. He did hit me. [foreign language 00:23:49]. And well</br>   he... is not, how do you say, is not jail-jail. It's like they just keep</br>   you in a room for 37 hours. Three days. Yeah. Luckily, I was like, well, a</br>   day and a half. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did they give you food and water, or no?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I had to call my family to provide me with that. But nah. Like at</br>   first, yeah, they gave me water, yeah. But then they wanted me to call my</br>   mom in so they can provide me with, I don't know, with my needs. But there</br>   was one time that when I got caught, there was a dude, he was more time</br>   there than me. So he saw that one of the police guys, or the people that</br>   are doing the scripts and the paperwork, they tienen sus garnachas their</br>   tacos, and everything. He was like, &quot;Hey hey, can you give me, I haven't</br>   ate anything. I haven't ate anything.&quot; And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">Se porto buena onda,</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Translating for">Se porto buena onda,</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">tienen sus garnachas their   taco</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Translating for">tienen sus garnachas their   taco</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Values, Return to Mexico, Cultural differences">Sergio: How do you think the living in the US has shaped who you are?

But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I</br>   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So how about now? Fast forward to now, how do you feel?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I feel pretty good. Thinking how all that has changed, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like you want to stay here now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, well…you know at the beginning it was hard because, like I</br>   mentioned, I think the States, well like since you're in the city you see</br>   everything more cleaner, right? Like I mean in general, like people,</br>   police, schools, houses, streets. And here, well it was different. It was</br>   different. Like you get, how do you say? Te acostumbras ya de algo. How you</br>   can say that?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You got used to something?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, you get used to something. So when you are used to something</br>   and then you change to a different environment, well it is kind of hard.</br>   But you adapt yourself at the long time.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How do you think the living in the US has shaped who you are?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, let's see, well, culture I think, yeah. The culture from</br>   over there and the culture from here. I think it makes me have a more open</br>   mind. Yeah, we can see that we're, yeah. It shaped me like to a person that</br>   has his mind open, he's always sees the good and the bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you have anything else that you think you want to say about</br>   being in the US, or being here, that you feel like people should know?</br>   Whether it's a good experience, a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, yeah sure. Like when you get to a country that you don't</br>   know, like trust me it does get hard, it's hard. But you'll get used to it.</br>   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my</br>   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think</br>   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one</br>   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard</br>   to get the food in the table.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to</br>   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to</br>   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is</br>   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If</br>   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in</br>   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,</br>   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think</br>   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful</br>   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's</br>   what I always think.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You play video games?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I like video games.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It sounds like you play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Halo, yeah I used to play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I am more PlayStation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play Halo a lot, I like Halo, and</br>   Battlefield.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh well when they came out, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at</br>   E3.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh yes, do you know the E3 Conference?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It's happening next week or something. Sorry, what were you saying?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah yeah. Yeah I used to play just one of the first two of</br>   Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That one was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... and you can add two guns. That was pretty dope.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Drugs, Addiction">Sergio: So, I'm trying to think. There was another question but I kind   of... Do you still, I know you mentioned like maybe addiction…do you still   struggle with addiction now?     Roberto: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the States, man it's   hard, and when you know that a 13-year-old kid doing drugs and all that,   think it was pretty hard for my mom.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Pastimes,  video games">Sergio: You play video games?     Roberto: Yeah, I like video games.     Sergio: It sounds like you play Halo.     Roberto: Halo, yeah I used to play Halo.     Sergio: So you-     Roberto: I am more PlayStation.     Sergio: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play Halo a lot, I like Halo, and   Battlefield.     Roberto: Oh well when they came out, yeah.     Sergio: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at   E3.     Roberto: Oh yeah?     Sergio: Oh yes, do you know the E3 Conference?     Roberto: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Well I don't know, it was kind of different because when   we came back, we came back to Xochimilco. So…we were like in this town,   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only   white kid, I was, and it was weird.     Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully   you for that, or like what?     Roberto: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know.

But when I came here to Mexico, well, I realized that   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well   if my whole family is here, well, I'm Mexican. But I could have family over   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I   have here, and the family that I have in the US. The family that I have in   US is only my grandma and like some of my uncles. And I have my whole   family here in Mexico.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Immigration status, Living undocumented, Not knowing status, Learning status, Identity, American">Sergio: You mentioned you didn't know you were undocumented.     Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).     Sergio: When did you find out? Was it-     Roberto: Like at what age, or?     Sergio: What age.     Roberto: Well like several years, like when I began living with my dad,   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were   supposed to go like to Disneyland, and well we stayed there. We didn't   return to Mexico, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.     Sergio: So before that, did you always think you were a US citizen? Or what   did you think?     Roberto: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the   flag, and sing the... It's called-     Sergio: Pledge of Allegiance.     Roberto: Yeah, to the flag of the United States of America. [Laughs]     Sergio: Do you remember how it goes?     Roberto: No, I just remember that part, &quot;Pledge Allegiance to the flag of   the United States of America.&quot; And that's that. When I was in elementary,   yeah, lo sabía todo. I used to know it all.     Sergio: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought   you were different, right?     Roberto: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.     Sergio: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going   through your mind?     Roberto: Oh like, &quot;Damn. For real?&quot; I was like, I don't know, yeah, I   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was   born in Mexico. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when   I came here to Mexico, yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Family, Parents/step-parents, Family Separation, Homelife, Being alone, Mental Health">Roberto: I don't know, I think problems in my house. It's pretty difficult,   grew up with no... How you say? With father. It's pretty difficult.     Sergio: Yeah, that makes me think a lot about how I grew up, because I also   grew up without a dad, and-     Roberto: And it was pretty [inaudible] because... How do you say you like,   figura paterna?     Sergio: I don't know [crosstalk 00:07:51].     Roberto: Well, I didn't grow up with that. And I started like to look for   that you know… figure with my brother's dad. Yeah.     Sergio: This is your stepdad?     Roberto: My brother's... Yeah, my stepdad.     Sergio: You think he provided that support, or what happened?     Roberto: I don't know, it was like really bad, like trying see that your   little brother has a father and everything, you know. Like he shows him   love and everything, and me on the inside, I was like, &quot;Fuck man, I wish I   can had a dad like that.&quot;     Sergio: And this is while you were in the US. Where was your dad?     Roberto: Mexico, working.     Sergio: Did you have contact with him?     Roberto: Yeah.     Sergio: How often would you like talk to him, or?     Roberto: And right now, we talk super great. But when I was in States, he   like what, once a year he used to come.     Sergio: Do you feel like that was enough?

Sergio: Was it hard for her?     Roberto: Yeah, of course because my mom had the support of my family. And   well, when she came here in Mexico, yeah well, it's difficult.

You can say that that's another reason why we</br>   returned.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So she was having legal troubles too, with the other-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: With my stepbrother, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And he's a US citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: The brother?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did he stay over there?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, he's here-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: He came back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was it because your stepfather was aggressive, or what kind of</br>   legal troubles?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No the... What's it called? Custody, of the child, my brother.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Your mom got it?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I suppose, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So have you felt welcomed back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, with my family, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How about outside?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Outside? Well I don't know, it was kind of different because when</br>   we came back, we came back to Xochimilco. So…we were like in this town,</br>   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No</br>   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird</br>   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only</br>   white kid, I was, and it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully</br>   you for that, or like what?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know. Yeah, ya sabes dos</br>   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I</br>   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that</br>   as well. But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I</br>   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So how about now? Fast forward to now, how do you feel?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I feel pretty good. Thinking how all that has changed, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like you want to stay here now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, well…you know at the beginning it was hard because, like I</br>   mentioned, I think the States, well like since you're in the city you see</br>   everything more cleaner, right? Like I mean in general, like people,</br>   police, schools, houses, streets. And here, well it was different. It was</br>   different. Like you get, how do you say? Te acostumbras ya de algo. How you</br>   can say that?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You got used to something?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, you get used to something. So when you are used to something</br>   and then you change to a different environment, well it is kind of hard.</br>   But you adapt yourself at the long time.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How do you think the living in the US has shaped who you are?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, let's see, well, culture I think, yeah. The culture from</br>   over there and the culture from here. I think it makes me have a more open</br>   mind. Yeah, we can see that we're, yeah. It shaped me like to a person that</br>   has his mind open, he's always sees the good and the bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you have anything else that you think you want to say about</br>   being in the US, or being here, that you feel like people should know?</br>   Whether it's a good experience, a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, yeah sure. Like when you get to a country that you don't</br>   know, like trust me it does get hard, it's hard. But you'll get used to it.</br>   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my</br>   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think</br>   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one</br>   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard</br>   to get the food in the table.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to</br>   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to</br>   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is</br>   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If</br>   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in</br>   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,</br>   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think</br>   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful</br>   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's</br>   what I always think.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You play video games?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I like video games.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It sounds like you play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Halo, yeah I used to play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I am more PlayStation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play Halo a lot, I like Halo, and</br>   Battlefield.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh well when they came out, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at</br>   E3.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh yes, do you know the E3 Conference?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It's happening next week or something. Sorry, what were you saying?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah yeah. Yeah I used to play just one of the first two of</br>   Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That one was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... and you can add two guns. That was pretty dope.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, I'm trying to think. There was another question but I kind</br>   of... Do you still, I know you mentioned like maybe addiction…do you still</br>   struggle with addiction now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I</br>   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the States, man it's</br>   hard, and when you know that a 13-year-old kid doing drugs and all that,</br>   think it was pretty hard for my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: But like, well, I think by the time I have learned the good</br>   things, and the bad things. So I think, I always say that if you have</br>   everything on the limit, you should be fine.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah. But when my mom catch me, all that stuff, like it was really</br>   hard. No, there was no trust anymore. And it was, if I wanted it to go this</br>   side, &quot;No, you cannot go because you're going to do your stuff.&quot; Yeah it</br>   was difficult. But you know right now, I'm doing fine. I think I've learned</br>   to keep that balance.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay. Well thank you so much for your time. I think those are all</br>   the questions I have. More might come up later. But what do you think you</br>   would have done if you would've stayed in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know. Well, probably end up in jail, get deported, most</br>   likely.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You haven't been-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Or-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: ... in jail here?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: In jail here? Not jail-jail, but yeah, like how do you say?</br>   …[Inaudible 00:23:35]? they just, I was like arguing with a police and that</br>   police got pissed off. He did hit me. [foreign language 00:23:49]. And well</br>   he... is not, how do you say, is not jail-jail. It's like they just keep</br>   you in a room for 37 hours. Three days. Yeah. Luckily, I was like, well, a</br>   day and a half. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did they give you food and water, or no?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I had to call my family to provide me with that. But nah. Like at</br>   first, yeah, they gave me water, yeah. But then they wanted me to call my</br>   mom in so they can provide me with, I don't know, with my needs. But there</br>   was one time that when I got caught, there was a dude, he was more time</br>   there than me. So he saw that one of the police guys, or the people that</br>   are doing the scripts and the paperwork, they tienen sus garnachas their</br>   tacos, and everything. He was like, &quot;Hey hey, can you give me, I haven't</br>   ate anything. I haven't ate anything.&quot; And Se porto buena onda, he gave him</br>   his food. And that was fine, nobody I think wants to give their food to a</br>   fucking criminal. But yeah. Like he didn't ask for... I didn't ask for</br>   water, because I didn't need it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay. Okay, but yeah, thanks for your time, again. I appreciate it,</br>   Roberto.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, it was a pleasure.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
