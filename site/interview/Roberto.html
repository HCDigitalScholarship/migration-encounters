   Sergio: So my name is Sergio. I'm here with Roberto ten, Robert ten, on<br>
   recorder number five, starting the interview. Okay Roberto, so the first<br>
   question I want to ask you is why did your family leave Mexico in the first<br>
   place?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Okay, well my family leave Mexico…well like I mentioned, we had<br>
   some economic issues over there. Plus my mom also, he got separated, my<br>
   dad, so she needed to start from zero.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: At what age did you leave?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: What age did I leave? I leaved at around three years, three years<br>
   old. If I'm not mistaken.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Three years old. And what's one of your first memories in the US?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: My first memories hmm…well, I don't know the place, every time<br>
   that I try to picture United States, I picture like the streets, the<br>
   places, the cars, everything, like most the streets, clean, I don't know,<br>
   clean. That's how I picture the States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Do you have like a memory that really sticks out, that you feel<br>
   like this is America? Or this is the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Oh well, the houses, the school, the product you know. Like when I<br>
   say product, I mean the candies, the Hot Cheetos, and all that. The<br>
   burgers, McDonald's, and all that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: When your family left, you said your mom separated from your dad?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Who else did your family leave behind?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: In Mexico, right? Well, my mom left behind like most of my family.<br>
   Most of my family is in here. Like my mom's grandma, a lot of my uncles,<br>
   that it will be uncles or aunts of my mom. How do you say? Well yeah, like<br>
   I mentioned most of the family she left here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Was it hard for her?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, of course because my mom had the support of my family. And<br>
   well, when she came here in Mexico, yeah well, it's difficult. Like I<br>
   mentioned, I think it's difficult when you're in a different country where<br>
   you don't know nothing, not even the language, and it's difficult, and<br>
   trying to raise three kids.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Like I mean, she did had support of my grandma, but the<br>
   relationship of my mom and my grandma wasn't too good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So when you got to the United States, what do you remember from the<br>
   school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: The teachers. The teachers, and well the classrooms, the<br>
   playground, and... How do you say? Mis compañeros?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: School? Peers?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: The peers?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah that's what I remember there, yeah. And it was good. I liked<br>
   the school over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: When you were there, did you always know you were undocumented, or<br>
   was there a day that you realized-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: No. I never knew that I was... never knew, since like when I came<br>
   here to Mexico, my dad told me. I thought like we did have you know<br>
   documents to be there, but then he told me, "No" like, "You were there<br>
   illegal."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So what happened when you were there, living in the United States,<br>
   you were living with your mom, your siblings. What was your house like?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: It was apartment, it was a small apartment. I lived in Cali and<br>
   L.A. and it was hot. Those temperatures, when it's cold, it gets very cold,<br>
   and when it's hot, it gets very hot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Yeah I know, I'm from Pomona, so right there next to...not next to,<br>
   but like 30 minutes away from North Hollywood. It gets very hot. From<br>
   there, what age did you leave?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: What age? I leaved like, let’s see, at the age of like…13.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You were 13. What was that like for you when you were leaving? Why<br>
   did you leave?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well I had issues, you know. In school I was flunking subjects. I<br>
   wasn't doing pretty much well in school, I had issues with my mom I used to<br>
   argue a lot with her, and addiction problems.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Addiction to what?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Marijuana, Cannabis, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: At 13? Or like before?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: No like 12, 13, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Well what do you think like made you-?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Nah well you know hanging with the big guys you want to feel big,<br>
   and just do stupid stuff…Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Who were the big guys?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well some people that, well, I used to hang out in the<br>
   neighborhood. Like they were like what? If I was 13 right there, or 12,<br>
   those guys were like 15, 16.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Did you see them as friends?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Huh?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Did you see them as like your friends, or?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Some of them, yeah. I did have friends in school as well.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So what do you think made you like attracted to smoking, or?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I don't know, I think problems in my house. It's pretty difficult,<br>
   grew up with no... How you say? With father. It's pretty difficult.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Yeah, that makes me think a lot about how I grew up, because I also<br>
   grew up without a dad, and-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: And it was pretty [inaudible] because... How do you say you like,<br>
   figura paterna?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: I don't know [crosstalk 00:07:51].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well, I didn't grow up with that. And I started like to look for<br>
   that you know… figure with my brother's dad. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: This is your stepdad?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: My brother's... Yeah, my stepdad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You think he provided that support, or what happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I don't know, it was like really bad, like trying see that your<br>
   little brother has a father and everything, you know. Like he shows him<br>
   love and everything, and me on the inside, I was like, "Fuck man, I wish I<br>
   can had a dad like that."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: And this is while you were in the US. Where was your dad?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Mexico, working.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Did you have contact with him?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: How often would you like talk to him, or?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: And right now, we talk super great. But when I was in States, he<br>
   like what, once a year he used to come.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Do you feel like that was enough?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: No, of course not, that's not enough.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So when you left when you were 13, because you were having<br>
   problems.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You mentioned you didn't know you were undocumented.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: When did you find out? Was it-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Like at what age, or?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: What age.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well like several years, like when I began living with my dad,<br>
   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about<br>
   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were<br>
   supposed to go like to Disneyland, and well we stayed there. We didn't<br>
   return to Mexico, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So before that, did you always think you were a US citizen? Or what<br>
   did you think?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of<br>
   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,<br>
   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the<br>
   flag, and sing the... It's called-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Pledge of Allegiance.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, to the flag of the United States of America. [Laughs]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Do you remember how it goes?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: No, I just remember that part, "Pledge Allegiance to the flag of<br>
   the United States of America." And that's that. When I was in elementary,<br>
   yeah, lo sabía todo. I used to know it all.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought<br>
   you were different, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you<br>
   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that<br>
   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going<br>
   through your mind?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Oh like, "Damn. For real?" I was like, I don't know, yeah, I<br>
   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a<br>
   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was<br>
   born in Mexico. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when<br>
   I came here to Mexico, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You thought you were going to be here just for a little bit and<br>
   then go back to the US?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: For a while, not for a little bit, but I thought I was only going<br>
   to be for a while. But when I came here to Mexico, well, I realized that<br>
   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well<br>
   if my whole family is here, well, I'm Mexican. But I could have family over<br>
   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I<br>
   have here, and the family that I have in the US. The family that I have in<br>
   US is only my grandma and like some of my uncles. And I have my whole<br>
   family here in Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So you're okay living right here, or?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I like it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You weren't sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I'm sorry?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Were you sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well yeah, my mom told me that we're not going back to the States.<br>
   And well, like I have a younger brother who was born over there as well.<br>
   And well, my mom was also having some legal problems with my little<br>
   brother, and his father. You can say that that's another reason why we<br>
   returned.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So she was having legal troubles too, with the other-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: With my stepbrother, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: And he's a US citizen?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: The brother?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Did he stay over there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: No, he's here-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: He came back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: ... yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Was it because your stepfather was aggressive, or what kind of<br>
   legal troubles?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: No the... What's it called? Custody, of the child, my brother.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Your mom got it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I suppose, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So have you felt welcomed back to Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, with my family, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: How about outside?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Outside? Well I don't know, it was kind of different because when<br>
   we came back, we came back to Xochimilco. So…we were like in this town,<br>
   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No<br>
   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird<br>
   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only<br>
   white kid, I was, and it was weird.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully<br>
   you for that, or like what?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know. Yeah, ya sabes dos<br>
   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I<br>
   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that<br>
   as well. But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I<br>
   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So how about now? Fast forward to now, how do you feel?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I feel pretty good. Thinking how all that has changed, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Do you feel like you want to stay here now?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, well…you know at the beginning it was hard because, like I<br>
   mentioned, I think the States, well like since you're in the city you see<br>
   everything more cleaner, right? Like I mean in general, like people,<br>
   police, schools, houses, streets. And here, well it was different. It was<br>
   different. Like you get, how do you say? Te acostumbras ya de algo. How you<br>
   can say that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You got used to something?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, you get used to something. So when you are used to something<br>
   and then you change to a different environment, well it is kind of hard.<br>
   But you adapt yourself at the long time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: How do you think the living in the US has shaped who you are?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well, let's see, well, culture I think, yeah. The culture from<br>
   over there and the culture from here. I think it makes me have a more open<br>
   mind. Yeah, we can see that we're, yeah. It shaped me like to a person that<br>
   has his mind open, he's always sees the good and the bad stuff.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Do you have anything else that you think you want to say about<br>
   being in the US, or being here, that you feel like people should know?<br>
   Whether it's a good experience, a bad experience?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Well, yeah sure. Like when you get to a country that you don't<br>
   know, like trust me it does get hard, it's hard. But you'll get used to it.<br>
   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my<br>
   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think<br>
   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one<br>
   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard<br>
   to get the food in the table.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to<br>
   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to<br>
   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is<br>
   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If<br>
   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in<br>
   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,<br>
   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think<br>
   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful<br>
   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's<br>
   what I always think.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You play video games?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, I like video games.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: It sounds like you play Halo.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Halo, yeah I used to play Halo.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So you-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I am more PlayStation.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play Halo a lot, I like Halo, and<br>
   Battlefield.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Oh well when they came out, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at<br>
   E3.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Oh yeah?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Oh yes, do you know the E3 Conference?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: It's happening next week or something. Sorry, what were you saying?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Oh yeah yeah. Yeah I used to play just one of the first two of<br>
   Halo.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: That one was my favorite.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, yeah-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: That was my favorite.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: ... and you can add two guns. That was pretty dope.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: So, I'm trying to think. There was another question but I kind<br>
   of... Do you still, I know you mentioned like maybe addiction…do you still<br>
   struggle with addiction now?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I<br>
   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the States, man it's<br>
   hard, and when you know that a 13-year-old kid doing drugs and all that,<br>
   think it was pretty hard for my mom.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: But like, well, I think by the time I have learned the good<br>
   things, and the bad things. So I think, I always say that if you have<br>
   everything on the limit, you should be fine.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah. But when my mom catch me, all that stuff, like it was really<br>
   hard. No, there was no trust anymore. And it was, if I wanted it to go this<br>
   side, "No, you cannot go because you're going to do your stuff." Yeah it<br>
   was difficult. But you know right now, I'm doing fine. I think I've learned<br>
   to keep that balance.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Okay. Well thank you so much for your time. I think those are all<br>
   the questions I have. More might come up later. But what do you think you<br>
   would have done if you would've stayed in the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I don't know. Well, probably end up in jail, get deported, most<br>
   likely.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: You haven't been-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Or-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: ... in jail here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: In jail here? Not jail-jail, but yeah, like how do you say?<br>
   …[Inaudible 00:23:35]? they just, I was like arguing with a police and that<br>
   police got pissed off. He did hit me. [foreign language 00:23:49]. And well<br>
   he... is not, how do you say, is not jail-jail. It's like they just keep<br>
   you in a room for 37 hours. Three days. Yeah. Luckily, I was like, well, a<br>
   day and a half. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Did they give you food and water, or no?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: I had to call my family to provide me with that. But nah. Like at<br>
   first, yeah, they gave me water, yeah. But then they wanted me to call my<br>
   mom in so they can provide me with, I don't know, with my needs. But there<br>
   was one time that when I got caught, there was a dude, he was more time<br>
   there than me. So he saw that one of the police guys, or the people that<br>
   are doing the scripts and the paperwork, they tienen sus garnachas their<br>
   tacos, and everything. He was like, "Hey hey, can you give me, I haven't<br>
   ate anything. I haven't ate anything." And Se porto buena onda, he gave him<br>
   his food. And that was fine, nobody I think wants to give their food to a<br>
   fucking criminal. But yeah. Like he didn't ask for... I didn't ask for<br>
   water, because I didn't need it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Sergio: Okay. Okay, but yeah, thanks for your time, again. I appreciate it,<br>
   Roberto.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, it was a pleasure.<br>
