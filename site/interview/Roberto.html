   question I want to ask you is why did your family leave Mexico in the first<br>
   place?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Okay, well my family leave Mexico…well like I mentioned, we had<br>
   some economic issues over there. Plus my mom also, he got separated, my<br>
   dad, so she needed to start from zero.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Sergio: At what age did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: What age did I leave? I leaved at around three years, three years</br>   old. If I'm not mistaken.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Three years old. And what's one of your first memories in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: My first memories hmm…well, I don't know the place, every time</br>   that I try to picture United States, I picture like the streets, the</br>   places, the cars, everything, like most the streets, clean, I don't know,</br>   clean. That's how I picture the States.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you have like a memory that really sticks out, that you feel</br>   like this is America?

The</br>   burgers, McDonald's, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When your family left, you said your mom separated from your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Who else did your family leave behind?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: In Mexico, right? Well, my mom left behind like most of my family.</br>   Most of my family is in here. Like my mom's grandma, a lot of my uncles,</br>   that it will be uncles or aunts of my mom. How do you say? Well yeah, like</br>   I mentioned most of the family she left here.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was it hard for her?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, of course because my mom had the support of my family. And</br>   well, when she came here in Mexico, yeah well, it's difficult. Like I</br>   mentioned, I think it's difficult when you're in a different country where</br>   you don't know nothing, not even the language, and it's difficult, and</br>   trying to raise three kids.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Like I mean, she did had support of my grandma, but the</br>   relationship of my mom and my grandma wasn't too good.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So when you got to the United States, what do you remember from the</br>   school?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: The teachers. The teachers, and well the classrooms, the</br>   playground, and... How do you say? Mis compañeros?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: School? Peers?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: The peers?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah that's what I remember there, yeah. And it was good. I liked</br>   the school over there.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When you were there, did you always know you were undocumented, or</br>   was there a day that you realized-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No. I never knew that I was... never knew, since like when I came</br>   here to Mexico, my dad told me. I thought like we did have you know</br>   documents to be there, but then he told me, &quot;No&quot; like, &quot;You were there</br>   illegal.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So what happened when you were there, living in the United States,</br>   you were living with your mom, your siblings. What was your house like?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: It was apartment, it was a small apartment. I lived in Cali and</br>   L.A. and it was hot. Those temperatures, when it's cold, it gets very cold,</br>   and when it's hot, it gets very hot.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah I know, I'm from Pomona, so right there next to...not next to,</br>   but like 30 minutes away from North Hollywood. It gets very hot. From</br>   there, what age did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: What age? I leaved like, let’s see, at the age of like…13.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were 13. What was that like for you when you were leaving? Why</br>   did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well I had issues, you know. In school I was flunking subjects. I</br>   wasn't doing pretty much well in school, I had issues with my mom I used to</br>   argue a lot with her, and addiction problems.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Addiction to what?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Marijuana, Cannabis, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: At 13? Or like before?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No like 12, 13, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Well what do you think like made you-?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Nah well you know hanging with the big guys you want to feel big,</br>   and just do stupid stuff…Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Who were the big guys?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well some people that, well, I used to hang out in the</br>   neighborhood. Like they were like what? If I was 13 right there, or 12,</br>   those guys were like 15, 16.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you see them as friends?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you see them as like your friends, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Some of them, yeah. I did have friends in school as well.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So what do you think made you like attracted to smoking, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know, I think problems in my house. It's pretty difficult,</br>   grew up with no... How you say? With father. It's pretty difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah, that makes me think a lot about how I grew up, because I also</br>   grew up without a dad, and-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And it was pretty [inaudible] because... How do you say you like,</br>   figura paterna?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: I don't know [crosstalk 00:07:51].</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, I didn't grow up with that. And I started like to look for</br>   that you know… figure with my brother's dad. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: This is your stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: My brother's... Yeah, my stepdad.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You think he provided that support, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know, it was like really bad, like trying see that your</br>   little brother has a father and everything, you know. Like he shows him</br>   love and everything, and me on the inside, I was like, &quot;Fuck man, I wish I</br>   can had a dad like that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And this is while you were in the US. Where was your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mexico, working.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have contact with him?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How often would you like talk to him, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And right now, we talk super great. But when I was in States, he</br>   like what, once a year he used to come.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like that was enough?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, of course not, that's not enough.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So when you left when you were 13, because you were having</br>   problems.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You mentioned you didn't know you were undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When did you find out? Was it-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Like at what age, or?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What age.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well like several years, like when I began living with my dad,</br>   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about</br>   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were</br>   supposed to go like to Disneyland, and well we stayed there. We didn't</br>   return to Mexico, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So before that, did you always think you were a US citizen? Or what</br>   did you think?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of</br>   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,</br>   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the</br>   flag, and sing the... It's called-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Pledge of Allegiance.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, to the flag of the United States of America. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you remember how it goes?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, I just remember that part, &quot;Pledge Allegiance to the flag of</br>   the United States of America.&quot; And that's that. When I was in elementary,</br>   yeah, lo sabía todo. I used to know it all.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought</br>   you were different, right?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you</br>   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that</br>   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going</br>   through your mind?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh like, &quot;Damn. For real?&quot; I was like, I don't know, yeah, I</br>   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a</br>   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was</br>   born in Mexico. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when</br>   I came here to Mexico, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You thought you were going to be here just for a little bit and</br>   then go back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: For a while, not for a little bit, but I thought I was only going</br>   to be for a while. But when I came here to Mexico, well, I realized that</br>   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well</br>   if my whole family is here, well, I'm Mexican. But I could have family over</br>   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I</br>   have here, and the family that I have in the US. The family that I have in</br>   US is only my grandma and like some of my uncles. And I have my whole</br>   family here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you're okay living right here, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I like it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You weren't sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I'm sorry?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Were you sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, my mom told me that we're not going back to the States.</br>   And well, like I have a younger brother who was born over there as well.</br>   And well, my mom was also having some legal problems with my little</br>   brother, and his father. You can say that that's another reason why we</br>   returned.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So she was having legal troubles too, with the other-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: With my stepbrother, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And he's a US citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: The brother?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did he stay over there?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, he's here-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: He came back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was it because your stepfather was aggressive, or what kind of</br>   legal troubles?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No the... What's it called? Custody, of the child, my brother.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Your mom got it?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I suppose, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So have you felt welcomed back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, with my family, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How about outside?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Outside? Well I don't know, it was kind of different because when</br>   we came back, we came back to Xochimilco. So…we were like in this town,</br>   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No</br>   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird</br>   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only</br>   white kid, I was, and it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully</br>   you for that, or like what?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know. Yeah, ya sabes dos</br>   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I</br>   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that</br>   as well. But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I</br>   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So how about now? Fast forward to now, how do you feel?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I feel pretty good. Thinking how all that has changed, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like you want to stay here now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, well…you know at the beginning it was hard because, like I</br>   mentioned, I think the States, well like since you're in the city you see</br>   everything more cleaner, right? Like I mean in general, like people,</br>   police, schools, houses, streets. And here, well it was different. It was</br>   different. Like you get, how do you say? Te acostumbras ya de algo. How you</br>   can say that?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You got used to something?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, you get used to something. So when you are used to something</br>   and then you change to a different environment, well it is kind of hard.</br>   But you adapt yourself at the long time.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How do you think the living in the US has shaped who you are?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, let's see, well, culture I think, yeah. The culture from</br>   over there and the culture from here. I think it makes me have a more open</br>   mind. Yeah, we can see that we're, yeah. It shaped me like to a person that</br>   has his mind open, he's always sees the good and the bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you have anything else that you think you want to say about</br>   being in the US, or being here, that you feel like people should know?</br>   Whether it's a good experience, a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, yeah sure. Like when you get to a country that you don't</br>   know, like trust me it does get hard, it's hard. But you'll get used to it.</br>   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my</br>   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think</br>   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one</br>   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard</br>   to get the food in the table.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to</br>   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to</br>   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is</br>   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If</br>   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in</br>   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,</br>   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think</br>   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful</br>   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's</br>   what I always think.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You play video games?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I like video games.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It sounds like you play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Halo, yeah I used to play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I am more PlayStation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play Halo a lot, I like Halo, and</br>   Battlefield.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh well when they came out, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at</br>   E3.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh yes, do you know the E3 Conference?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It's happening next week or something. Sorry, what were you saying?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah yeah. Yeah I used to play just one of the first two of</br>   Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That one was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... and you can add two guns. That was pretty dope.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, I'm trying to think. There was another question but I kind</br>   of... Do you still, I know you mentioned like maybe addiction…do you still</br>   struggle with addiction now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I</br>   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the States, man it's</br>   hard, and when you know that a 13-year-old kid doing drugs and all that,</br>   think it was pretty hard for my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: But like, well, I think by the time I have learned the good</br>   things, and the bad things. So I think, I always say that if you have</br>   everything on the limit, you should be fine.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah. But when my mom catch me, all that stuff, like it was really</br>   hard. No, there was no trust anymore. And it was, if I wanted it to go this</br>   side, &quot;No, you cannot go because you're going to do your stuff.&quot; Yeah it</br>   was difficult. But you know right now, I'm doing fine. I think I've learned</br>   to keep that balance.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay. Well thank you so much for your time. I think those are all</br>   the questions I have. More might come up later. But what do you think you</br>   would have done if you would've stayed in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know. Well, probably end up in jail, get deported, most</br>   likely.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You haven't been-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Or-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: ... in jail here?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: In jail here? Not jail-jail, but yeah, like how do you say?</br>   …[Inaudible 00:23:35]? they just, I was like arguing with a police and that</br>   police got pissed off. He did hit me. [foreign language 00:23:49]. And well</br>   he... is not, how do you say, is not jail-jail. It's like they just keep</br>   you in a room for 37 hours. Three days. Yeah. Luckily, I was like, well, a</br>   day and a half. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did they give you food and water, or no?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I had to call my family to provide me with that. But nah. Like at</br>   first, yeah, they gave me water, yeah. But then they wanted me to call my</br>   mom in so they can provide me with, I don't know, with my needs. But there</br>   was one time that when I got caught, there was a dude, he was more time</br>   there than me. So he saw that one of the police guys, or the people that</br>   are doing the scripts and the paperwork, they tienen sus garnachas their</br>   tacos, and everything. He was like, &quot;Hey hey, can you give me, I haven't</br>   ate anything. I haven't ate anything.&quot; And <span id="4ea5a4a9-e61f-4e3e-a6b0-6e07c0ac9a32" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">Se porto buena onda,</span><span id="8a193911-5d37-4e80-b9c8-838073a583e5" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Translating for">Se porto buena onda,</span><span id="c09e5514-00c0-4245-9ca4-3090b6fb176f" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="typo">tienen sus garnachas their<br>

Or like before?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No like 12, 13, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Well what do you think like made you-?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Nah well you know hanging with the big guys you want to feel big,</br>   and just do stupid stuff…Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Who were the big guys?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well some people that, well, I used to hang out in the</br>   neighborhood. Like they were like what? If I was 13 right there, or 12,</br>   those guys were like 15, 16.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you see them as friends?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you see them as like your friends, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Some of them, yeah. I did have friends in school as well.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So what do you think made you like attracted to smoking, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know, I think problems in my house. It's pretty difficult,</br>   grew up with no... How you say? With father. It's pretty difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah, that makes me think a lot about how I grew up, because I also</br>   grew up without a dad, and-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And it was pretty [inaudible] because... How do you say you like,</br>   figura paterna?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: I don't know [crosstalk 00:07:51].</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, I didn't grow up with that. And I started like to look for</br>   that you know… figure with my brother's dad. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: This is your stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: My brother's... Yeah, my stepdad.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You think he provided that support, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know, it was like really bad, like trying see that your</br>   little brother has a father and everything, you know. Like he shows him</br>   love and everything, and me on the inside, I was like, &quot;Fuck man, I wish I</br>   can had a dad like that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And this is while you were in the US. Where was your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mexico, working.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have contact with him?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How often would you like talk to him, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And right now, we talk super great. But when I was in States, he</br>   like what, once a year he used to come.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like that was enough?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, of course not, that's not enough.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So when you left when you were 13, because you were having</br>   problems.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You mentioned you didn't know you were undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When did you find out? Was it-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Like at what age, or?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What age.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well like several years, like when I began living with my dad,</br>   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about</br>   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were</br>   supposed to go like to Disneyland, and well we stayed there. We didn't</br>   return to Mexico, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So before that, did you always think you were a US citizen? Or what</br>   did you think?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of</br>   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,</br>   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the</br>   flag, and sing the... It's called-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Pledge of Allegiance.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, to the flag of the United States of America. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you remember how it goes?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, I just remember that part, &quot;Pledge Allegiance to the flag of</br>   the United States of America.&quot; And that's that. When I was in elementary,</br>   yeah, lo sabía todo. I used to know it all.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought</br>   you were different, right?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you</br>   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that</br>   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going</br>   through your mind?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh like, &quot;Damn. For real?&quot; I was like, I don't know, yeah, I</br>   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a</br>   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was</br>   born in Mexico. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when</br>   I came here to Mexico, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You thought you were going to be here just for a little bit and</br>   then go back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: For a while, not for a little bit, but I thought I was only going</br>   to be for a while. But when I came here to Mexico, well, I realized that</br>   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well</br>   if my whole family is here, well, I'm Mexican. But I could have family over</br>   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I</br>   have here, and the family that I have in the US. The family that I have in</br>   US is only my grandma and like some of my uncles. And I have my whole</br>   family here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you're okay living right here, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I like it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You weren't sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I'm sorry?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Were you sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, my mom told me that we're not going back to the States.</br>   And well, like I have a younger brother who was born over there as well.</br>   And well, my mom was also having some legal problems with my little</br>   brother, and his father. You can say that that's another reason why we</br>   returned.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So she was having legal troubles too, with the other-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: With my stepbrother, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And he's a US citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: The brother?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did he stay over there?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, he's here-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: He came back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was it because your stepfather was aggressive, or what kind of</br>   legal troubles?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No the... What's it called? Custody, of the child, my brother.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Your mom got it?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I suppose, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So have you felt welcomed back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, with my family, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How about outside?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Outside? Well I don't know, it was kind of different because when</br>   we came back, we came back to Xochimilco. So…we were like in this town,</br>   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No</br>   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird</br>   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only</br>   white kid, I was, and it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully</br>   you for that, or like what?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know. Yeah, ya sabes dos</br>   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I</br>   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that</br>   as well. But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I</br>   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So how about now? Fast forward to now, how do you feel?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I feel pretty good. Thinking how all that has changed, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like you want to stay here now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, well…you know at the beginning it was hard because, like I</br>   mentioned, I think the States, well like since you're in the city you see</br>   everything more cleaner, right? Like I mean in general, like people,</br>   police, schools, houses, streets. And here, well it was different. It was</br>   different. Like you get, how do you say? Te acostumbras ya de algo. How you</br>   can say that?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You got used to something?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, you get used to something. So when you are used to something</br>   and then you change to a different environment, well it is kind of hard.</br>   But you adapt yourself at the long time.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How do you think the living in the US has shaped who you are?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, let's see, well, culture I think, yeah. The culture from</br>   over there and the culture from here. I think it makes me have a more open</br>   mind. Yeah, we can see that we're, yeah. It shaped me like to a person that</br>   has his mind open, he's always sees the good and the bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you have anything else that you think you want to say about</br>   being in the US, or being here, that you feel like people should know?</br>   Whether it's a good experience, a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, yeah sure. Like when you get to a country that you don't</br>   know, like trust me it does get hard, it's hard. But you'll get used to it.</br>   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my</br>   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think</br>   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one</br>   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard</br>   to get the food in the table.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to</br>   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to</br>   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is</br>   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If</br>   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in</br>   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,</br>   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think</br>   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful</br>   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's</br>   what I always think.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You play video games?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I like video games.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It sounds like you play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Halo, yeah I used to play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I am more PlayStation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play Halo a lot, I like Halo, and</br>   Battlefield.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh well when they came out, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at</br>   E3.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh yes, do you know the E3 Conference?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It's happening next week or something. Sorry, what were you saying?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah yeah. Yeah I used to play just one of the first two of</br>   Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That one was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... and you can add two guns.

There was another question but I kind<br>
   of... Do you still, I know you mentioned like maybe addiction…do you still<br>
   struggle with addiction now?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I<br>
   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the States, man it's<br>
   hard, and when you know that a 13-year-old kid doing drugs and all that,<br>
   think it was pretty hard for my mom.<br>

   here to Mexico, my dad told me. I thought like we did have you know<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Roberto: Yeah, of course because my mom had the support of my family. And<br>
   well, when she came here in Mexico, yeah well, it's difficult. Like I<br>
   mentioned, I think it's difficult when you're in a different country where<br>
   you don't know nothing, not even the language, and it's difficult, and<br>
   trying to raise three kids.<br>

   places, the cars, everything, like most the streets, clean, I don't know,<br>
   clean. That's how I picture the States.<br>

   Sergio: Do you have like a memory that really sticks out, that you feel<br>
   like this is America? Or this is the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>

Peers?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: The peers?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah that's what I remember there, yeah. And it was good. I liked</br>   the school over there.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When you were there, did you always know you were undocumented, or</br>   was there a day that you realized-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No. I never knew that I was... never knew, since like when I came</br>   here to Mexico, my dad told me.

What was your house like?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: It was apartment, it was a small apartment. I lived in Cali and</br>   L.A. and it was hot. Those temperatures, when it's cold, it gets very cold,</br>   and when it's hot, it gets very hot.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah I know, I'm from Pomona, so right there next to...not next to,</br>   but like 30 minutes away from North Hollywood. It gets very hot. From</br>   there, what age did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: What age? I leaved like, let’s see, at the age of like…13.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were 13. What was that like for you when you were leaving? Why</br>   did you leave?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well I had issues, you know. In school I was flunking subjects. I</br>   wasn't doing pretty much well in school, I had issues with my mom I used to</br>   argue a lot with her, and addiction problems.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Addiction to what?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Marijuana, Cannabis, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: At 13? Or like before?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No like 12, 13, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Well what do you think like made you-?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Nah well you know hanging with the big guys you want to feel big,</br>   and just do stupid stuff…Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Who were the big guys?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well some people that, well, I used to hang out in the</br>   neighborhood. Like they were like what? If I was 13 right there, or 12,</br>   those guys were like 15, 16.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you see them as friends?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you see them as like your friends, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Some of them, yeah. I did have friends in school as well.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So what do you think made you like attracted to smoking, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know, I think problems in my house. It's pretty difficult,</br>   grew up with no... How you say? With father. It's pretty difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah, that makes me think a lot about how I grew up, because I also</br>   grew up without a dad, and-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And it was pretty [inaudible] because... How do you say you like,</br>   figura paterna?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: I don't know [crosstalk 00:07:51].</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, I didn't grow up with that. And I started like to look for</br>   that you know… figure with my brother's dad. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: This is your stepdad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: My brother's... Yeah, my stepdad.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You think he provided that support, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know, it was like really bad, like trying see that your</br>   little brother has a father and everything, you know. Like he shows him</br>   love and everything, and me on the inside, I was like, &quot;Fuck man, I wish I</br>   can had a dad like that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And this is while you were in the US. Where was your dad?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mexico, working.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did you have contact with him?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How often would you like talk to him, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And right now, we talk super great. But when I was in States, he</br>   like what, once a year he used to come.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like that was enough?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, of course not, that's not enough.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So when you left when you were 13, because you were having</br>   problems.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You mentioned you didn't know you were undocumented.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: When did you find out? Was it-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Like at what age, or?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: What age.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well like several years, like when I began living with my dad,</br>   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about</br>   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were</br>   supposed to go like to Disneyland, and well we stayed there. We didn't</br>   return to Mexico, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So before that, did you always think you were a US citizen? Or what</br>   did you think?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of</br>   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,</br>   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the</br>   flag, and sing the... It's called-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Pledge of Allegiance.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, to the flag of the United States of America. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you remember how it goes?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, I just remember that part, &quot;Pledge Allegiance to the flag of</br>   the United States of America.&quot; And that's that. When I was in elementary,</br>   yeah, lo sabía todo. I used to know it all.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought</br>   you were different, right?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you</br>   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that</br>   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going</br>   through your mind?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh like, &quot;Damn. For real?&quot; I was like, I don't know, yeah, I</br>   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a</br>   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was</br>   born in Mexico. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when</br>   I came here to Mexico, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You thought you were going to be here just for a little bit and</br>   then go back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: For a while, not for a little bit, but I thought I was only going</br>   to be for a while. But when I came here to Mexico, well, I realized that</br>   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well</br>   if my whole family is here, well, I'm Mexican. But I could have family over</br>   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I</br>   have here, and the family that I have in the US. The family that I have in</br>   US is only my grandma and like some of my uncles. And I have my whole</br>   family here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you're okay living right here, or?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I like it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You weren't sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I'm sorry?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Were you sad that you weren't going to be able to go back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, my mom told me that we're not going back to the States.</br>   And well, like I have a younger brother who was born over there as well.</br>   And well, my mom was also having some legal problems with my little</br>   brother, and his father. You can say that that's another reason why we</br>   returned.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So she was having legal troubles too, with the other-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: With my stepbrother, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: And he's a US citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: The brother?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did he stay over there?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No, he's here-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: He came back?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was it because your stepfather was aggressive, or what kind of</br>   legal troubles?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: No the... What's it called? Custody, of the child, my brother.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Your mom got it?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I suppose, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So have you felt welcomed back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, with my family, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How about outside?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Outside? Well I don't know, it was kind of different because when</br>   we came back, we came back to Xochimilco. So…we were like in this town,</br>   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No</br>   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird</br>   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only</br>   white kid, I was, and it was weird.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully</br>   you for that, or like what?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know. Yeah, ya sabes dos</br>   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I</br>   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that</br>   as well. But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I</br>   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So how about now? Fast forward to now, how do you feel?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I feel pretty good. Thinking how all that has changed, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you feel like you want to stay here now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, well…you know at the beginning it was hard because, like I</br>   mentioned, I think the States, well like since you're in the city you see</br>   everything more cleaner, right? Like I mean in general, like people,</br>   police, schools, houses, streets. And here, well it was different. It was</br>   different. Like you get, how do you say? Te acostumbras ya de algo. How you</br>   can say that?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You got used to something?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, you get used to something. So when you are used to something</br>   and then you change to a different environment, well it is kind of hard.</br>   But you adapt yourself at the long time.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: How do you think the living in the US has shaped who you are?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, let's see, well, culture I think, yeah. The culture from</br>   over there and the culture from here. I think it makes me have a more open</br>   mind. Yeah, we can see that we're, yeah. It shaped me like to a person that</br>   has his mind open, he's always sees the good and the bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Do you have anything else that you think you want to say about</br>   being in the US, or being here, that you feel like people should know?</br>   Whether it's a good experience, a bad experience?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Well, yeah sure. Like when you get to a country that you don't</br>   know, like trust me it does get hard, it's hard. But you'll get used to it.</br>   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my</br>   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think</br>   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one</br>   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard</br>   to get the food in the table.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to</br>   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to</br>   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is</br>   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If</br>   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in</br>   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,</br>   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think</br>   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful</br>   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's</br>   what I always think.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You play video games?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, I like video games.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It sounds like you play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Halo, yeah I used to play Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So you-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I am more PlayStation.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh okay, I have an Xbox so I play Halo a lot, I like Halo, and</br>   Battlefield.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh well when they came out, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Was the new ones... I think the new one's going to be announced at</br>   E3.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Oh yes, do you know the E3 Conference?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: It's happening next week or something. Sorry, what were you saying?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Oh yeah yeah. Yeah I used to play just one of the first two of</br>   Halo.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That one was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, yeah-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: That was my favorite.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: ... and you can add two guns. That was pretty dope.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: So, I'm trying to think. There was another question but I kind</br>   of... Do you still, I know you mentioned like maybe addiction…do you still</br>   struggle with addiction now?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I</br>   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the States, man it's</br>   hard, and when you know that a 13-year-old kid doing drugs and all that,</br>   think it was pretty hard for my mom.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: But like, well, I think by the time I have learned the good</br>   things, and the bad things. So I think, I always say that if you have</br>   everything on the limit, you should be fine.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah. But when my mom catch me, all that stuff, like it was really</br>   hard. No, there was no trust anymore. And it was, if I wanted it to go this</br>   side, &quot;No, you cannot go because you're going to do your stuff.&quot; Yeah it</br>   was difficult. But you know right now, I'm doing fine. I think I've learned</br>   to keep that balance.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay. Well thank you so much for your time. I think those are all</br>   the questions I have. More might come up later. But what do you think you</br>   would have done if you would've stayed in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I don't know. Well, probably end up in jail, get deported, most</br>   likely.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: You haven't been-</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Or-</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: ... in jail here?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: In jail here? Not jail-jail, but yeah, like how do you say?</br>   …[Inaudible 00:23:35]? they just, I was like arguing with a police and that</br>   police got pissed off. He did hit me. [foreign language 00:23:49]. And well</br>   he... is not, how do you say, is not jail-jail. It's like they just keep</br>   you in a room for 37 hours. Three days. Yeah. Luckily, I was like, well, a</br>   day and a half. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Did they give you food and water, or no?</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: I had to call my family to provide me with that. But nah. Like at</br>   first, yeah, they gave me water, yeah. But then they wanted me to call my</br>   mom in so they can provide me with, I don't know, with my needs. But there</br>   was one time that when I got caught, there was a dude, he was more time</br>   there than me. So he saw that one of the police guys, or the people that</br>   are doing the scripts and the paperwork, they tienen sus garnachas their</br>   tacos, and everything. He was like, &quot;Hey hey, can you give me, I haven't</br>   ate anything. I haven't ate anything.&quot; And Se porto buena onda, he gave him</br>   his food. And that was fine, nobody I think wants to give their food to a</br>   fucking criminal. But yeah. Like he didn't ask for... I didn't ask for</br>   water, because I didn't need it.</br> </br> </br>   Sergio: Okay. Okay, but yeah, thanks for your time, again. I appreciate it,</br>   Roberto.</br> </br> </br>   Roberto: Yeah, it was a pleasure.</br> </div><\p>
