   from Hawaii and asked me if I want to go for a vacation. And I said yes and<br>
   I arrived to Palm Springs. Beautiful place. I just love it. And immediately<br>
   he asked me if I want to get a job because across our apartment they were<br>
   asking for people who want to work in a hotel. And I went to apply and they<br>
   gave me the job.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Rocio: In a month I already rent my own studio. I get my furniture. So I</br>   was all set up in a month—and of course I compare the payment here in</br>   Mexico over there—and I just stay, I mean without thinking, without</br>   planning, I just stayed. After a year I came back because I wasn't sure if</br>   I'm going to stay or not in the USA. And I started working again here and</br>   when I was in the job, someone opened my purse and stole my wallet and I</br>   arrived to work and I just saw it and I was like, “No, I don't like this</br>   anymore so I'm going to come back to Palm Springs.” And I did. And I stayed</br>   for 18 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And that second time when you went back, did you go on a tourist visa</br>   as well?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So both times?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said almost immediately you were offered a job. What kind of</br>   job was it in the hotel?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I was cleaning rooms. Something very different of course, because I</br>   work here in an office and it was hard for me. But really it was the</br>   difference in the salaries, that just made the difference you know. To have</br>   my studio in a month and furniture and everything I hear is hard to do</br>   that. So, and then I was by myself. I wasn't married, I didn't have kids, I</br>   didn't even plan it, but I stay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you feel accepted or did it take time to feel accepted in the</br>   community?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, immediately, I always love the language. I studied English at my</br>   school here and I immediately loved it. I just love America and no, it was</br>   very good for me in Palm Springs. Everybody, it was Filipino people, a lot</br>   of Mexicans. And it was welcome. I was very welcome.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's nice. Was it, so you got a job, did you have employment papers</br>   or how did that work?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, we went to LA to buy a social security card. So I always, for 18</br>   years, I worked with that social security.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you pay taxes?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And I pay taxes. And after that, I work in hotels, in restaurants.</br>   In 95, I get married and I have a baby daughter, Karen, and I stay for</br>   three more years in hotels. And after I separated from my husband, I begin</br>   to work in private residence. Of course, they never asked me for papers,</br>   but I still paying my taxes, always I pay taxes. I helped the Palm Springs</br>   police for charities and everything. And my daughter have a problem with</br>   her heart. She have a murmur?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And I have the best doctors, I have her Medical. So, I start</br>   paying a charity for St. John's hospital for kids because I have the same</br>   problem. Thank God, she's okay. And, of course, these people start paying</br>   me more money because they were rich people. Because Palm Springs is in</br>   summer it's so hot, they go away for three, four months. So I take care of</br>   their residence. And I mean, United States for me, was very good. Very good</br>   because I always was welcome. Always have a job.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: After 13 years, I have another kid, Chris, my son. I didn't get</br>   married, I have been by myself. And then I start working for these</br>   people—the last persons that I worked for. And my boss brings a friend from</br>   Michigan, and we start dating since the beginning. And his family, he just</br>   told me they don't like Mexicans. So after four years—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Of dating?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Dating, they just call immigration and my nightmare starts and my</br>   life just was over, because I lost everything. Thank God my kids weren't</br>   with me that day. My daughter was with her dad and my son was with a friend</br>   of mine. So they took me just by myself. But that's when everything</br>   started. I didn't come to Mexico for 18 years. So it was just a nightmare.</br>   That's when everything started.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you still have contact with that man?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, he never called me. He never answered me again or anything. So I</br>   don't know if he had something to do with it or not or I don't know. I</br>   don't even want to because, I mean if I was by myself, okay. But it was my</br>   family [emphasis]. Even though I rent or everything, I have a very good</br>   apartment and all my furniture, my car—I was paying my car.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Could you get a license in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, I had a good one. But after 10 years here in Mexico, they</br>   changed the visa for 10 years. Every 10 years you need to change it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And that's when I started having problems because I didn't change</br>   the visa and so I lost my license, even though I was able to buy cars, to</br>   rent apartments and I never have a problem with that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you get credit cards and—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No credit card. No, it's just a bank account, but not credit cards.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your children grew up as Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. Yes. My daughter speaks English because I teach her at the</br>   beginning. And at school, she started speaking English. My son never want</br>   to speak Spanish. Since I start talking to him in Spanish and he never</br>   wanted it. So when I bring him, after a year that I came here, I took him,</br>   I tried to keep him with me, but it was hard because I get a job. So very</br>   early in the morning, I take him with my aunt and I pick him up at night in</br>   pajamas already. So it was crazy for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Here in Mexico. I took him to schools to see if I can register him.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And he was how old?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: He was three years old, almost three. And he don't speak Spanish or</br>   they don't let me, they just don't take him. So, it was like two months</br>   after I bring him, that my friend called me and told me, “We need to think,</br>   he have everything here, you know, he's an American citizen. What are you</br>   going to do over there with him? You don't have a place. You live with your</br>   mom.”</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So that's when I need to make that decision to let him go, with my</br>   friend. She's everything to me. Of course, she's very, very—a great family.</br>   She just have a son. So, she signed it like a tutor [inquisitive] to keep</br>   him until I was able to come back. Because at the beginning I was fighting</br>   to go back and talking with everybody, but they told me, you have 10 years</br>   and you need to stay over there. So it was extremely hard for me to make</br>   that decision, but it's not for me. It's his life. He has everything over</br>   there. And I'm not going to take that away from him.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my daughter was 13 and of course she was in middle school and I</br>   told her, “No, you need to stay over there and finish your school. You have</br>   your dad.” Of course, after three or four years, she began to not behave,</br>   you know, and she didn't finish high school. She just finished second. She</br>   just left one year, but she didn't finish and she started having problems</br>   with behavior, living with friends, and I didn't know anything. Her dad</br>   can't control her. So it was very hard for me. Very, very hard for me. Even</br>   though my son started peeing the bed for two or three years, my friend</br>   needs to take him to a psychologist. Saturday he turns 12, but he's 12</br>   years old. We talked with him and try to explain to him, but he really</br>   don't understand why I cannot cross the border. Why he cannot come over</br>   here because it's hard for him to cross without me. And of course he's</br>   still having problems sometimes with behavior or gain weight or lose weight</br>   or depression.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Of course, everything is a disaster. I was two years in bed with</br>   depression. My first two years, I just don't want to live. So, thanks to my</br>   family, help me and said, “Your kids needs you. You can't just die in bed.”</br>   So I went to see psychiatrist, and they give me medication and I stayed on</br>   medication. And so, after I don't know, like five years or six years of</br>   being here, I start like, “Okay, I need to get involved in this, what I can</br>   do to help people and help myself.” You know? Just start doing what I'm</br>   going to do, it's six years already.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers. They took all my money,</br>   thousand dollars every time. Everybody telling me they going to help me to</br>   go back. And of course until I say okay, no more paying to lawyers or</br>   anything. And I met Yolanda Verona, the one who wants to create more</br>   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in</br>   Mexico. And I said, “Okay, but I just opened a Facebook page and everybody</br>   are in United States.” So, I was like, “No, I need to meet people here.”</br>   But in Mexico, I haven't met anybody, just one, Ana Laura Lopez, and she's</br>   helping a lot people that came here—she waits for them in the airport and</br>   help them if they don't have place to stay or a job, or anything. But she</br>   lives so far from me, so we met once but we can't even talk, you know to do</br>   something together yet.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they're called DREAMer moms?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: DREAMers moms.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does she know Israel here in New Comienzos?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I think yes, I think yes. I think Israel told me that they need to</br>   meet her, but I don't know if they did already. And they introduced me to</br>   Gretchen—I don't know the last name. The movie director. Do you know it?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They introduced me to her and she's working in Relaciones exteriores</br>   here in the government. So she told me once that I need to contact her</br>   because I'm going to be already 10 years here and she can help me to start</br>   to see what I can have. If I can have a visa to go just for visit or if my</br>   daughter can ask for me because she's 22 already. Or start something to do,</br>   what I’m going to do… and to get my son's passport.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he can visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So he can come visit me. And the situation here that has been so</br>   difficult for me. That is just unbelievable that even in the United States</br>   without papers, I was able to get my car, to rent apartments and here in</br>   Mexico I can't. They asked me for a lot of papers and it's just the doors</br>   close for me here all the time. And because my age. I just been working—in</br>   nine years, I just got three jobs. And last year I broke a bone in my back.</br>   So I stay a year in bed. After that, I'd been looking for a job for a year</br>   and I'm not able to get a job because my age, so it's just a nightmare. And</br>   so I've been trying to get more involved in these situations, to see if we</br>   can get together, the people that we go through this and help each other</br>   because it's just crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I mean you get in internet to get a job and it's just until you're</br>   35 years old. So what would you want to do here? I mean, I speak enough</br>   English to work in an office and they tell me no because my age. So it's</br>   been hard all this time, even though my friend said, “Well you have already</br>   nine years here.” I said, “For me it's been like nine hours.” I mean it's</br>   been very difficult and go through everything. My kids is the worst part.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And is your daughter, does she still live in Palm Springs?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: She live in Palm Springs. She get a Mexican boyfriend and he don't</br>   have papers. So, she's helping him to get papers to go with her to the</br>   United States because she got—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is she back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: She's in North of Mexico, Sonora. She crossed the border and</br>   everything and the baby born in USA, praise God. But she's helping him and</br>   I can't see her because I don't have the money to bring her. Do you know</br>   the flights and everything? I mean, I have very much contact with her and</br>   with my boy. With him I talk—of course he don't have Facebook or</br>   anything—every 15 days and with my daughter every time she's on Facebook we</br>   talk. But she have a baby and I haven't meet him. He's going to be already</br>   two years old. So I don't know, it's just a nightmare.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like a nightmare?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And for everybody in my family needs to help me. I feel like I'm 15</br>   years old because they pay my rent. So it's just everything is—I tried to</br>   kill myself two years ago when I broke my back and they told me I need to</br>   be in bed for a year because I can't have surgery. So it was like, I can't</br>   do this anymore. You know, it's just, I can't, but it wasn't my time. I</br>   hurt myself in every way you can imagine. And at night, it was time. I</br>   didn't do it. I can't do it. So I started going to the psychiatrist again,</br>   and everything is money, so it's just, I don't know when this is going to</br>   end you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well hopefully, at least when the 10 years are up, you'll be able to</br>   find some way. It's temporary.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yeah, I hope so. I hope so too. I don't even know, just do think if</br>   I can go back and stay or I just want to for the moment, I just want to go</br>   and be able to cross the border to see my kid every time I'm able to. And</br>   of course I want to stay because the situation here with the jobs is just</br>   crazy and I just can't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You have such good English, it's really too bad—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes!</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That people don't take advantage of that.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So I'm just starting to get more strength to help people because you</br>   know, hearing the stories and everything—my stories all the time here in my</br>   mind. I'm starting to like it because I love to help people you know? And I</br>   start when the situation with the DACA start in United States, I was like,</br>   “This is not fair, this can't be happening.” I have thousands of friends in</br>   United States that took their kids very young, one, two years old. And the</br>   future was going to be for them, you know? And if they took the kids, the</br>   parent stay or if they took the parent back, what would the kids going to</br>   do in the United States? My kids were so lucky to have my daughter, her</br>   father, and my son, my friend. But even though that's illegal because they</br>   just have a paper, we haven't been able to do nothing really legal because</br>   it's too expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my friend wants to adopt my kid and I'm not ready to do that</br>   either. I'm not going to take my son away from her because she's been so</br>   nice, but I'm not going to sign that you know [laughs]? So I mean, it's</br>   just a nightmare for everybody. It's just not right. We don't go to steal</br>   nobody's jobs. We go to have a better life. That's it. And we are very</br>   hardworking people. So I don't know what's going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you think back about your time, what were your favorite things</br>   about the U.S?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Oh. Everything. I mean for me it was a very good time. I had very</br>   good jobs. I have time to be with my kids a lot because I worked nine to</br>   four, so I have all afternoon with my kids. I was able go to the beach. As</br>   you know, Palm Springs is very close to the beach, the snow, and mountains.</br>   So I love the USA. I just love that place. So I hope—I mean it's not going</br>   to be the same of course, but it's different. I just always love to be</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think living there changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. In a good way. Very good way. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me how.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: You know I was more involved with the community. Here? Never—just my</br>   friends said that's it. Over there they teach me how to be involved with</br>   the community. Like with the police community when they did in the park,</br>   events. And I always were there. Here, Mexico, it's not like that. And I</br>   like that a lot. And respect for the community, the way we drive over</br>   there. Here in Mexico is just crazy. When I used to drive, everybody was</br>   telling me what are you doing? Do you need to stop? You need to drive</br>   carefully. And I just get it immediately. I liked that respect for others.</br>   I just click with everything. I just love it.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And gives me the opportunity to have the best doctors for my kids</br>   and that you have schools that you don't need pay much. When that happened</br>   to me, I thought to bring my daughter and I don't know, going to be able to</br>   pay your school and I'm not going to put her in a public school here</br>   because the difference is going to be too much for her. So I decided to</br>   leave her over there. So everything, I like everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said your son has been having difficulties, emotional</br>   problems?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. Emotional problems. I, of course, keep in touch with my friend</br>   and she's like, well this week he was in a fight at school. He eats when he</br>   is upset or nervous. Sometimes for a month or two he's okay and they talk</br>   to him a lot. She's like his behavior at school sometimes is—I don't know</br>   because he have dark hair. Or I told her you ought to be careful with</br>   bullying, maybe it's that and she's not that very involved with him at</br>   school and everything. But sometimes, like right now, it's getting better.</br>   But when he's nervous …he gets in middle school already and he told my</br>   friend I'm very afraid to go to school. So he begins to eat and eat and</br>   right now he is very big. But we talked to him a lot so I don't know what's</br>   going to happen. It’s still problems with—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my daughter never forgive me. She all the time… I tried to tell</br>   her to know what to do with the baby or something and she said like, “Why</br>   you left me? So what you going to tell me about it?” And I say, “Karen</br>   you're 22 you need to understand.” And she is like, “No, you never, [pause]</br>   why'd you sign it for you to leave?” I mean she's very upset with me too, I</br>   don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't win. You said that one of your children, your daughter, had</br>   a heart murmur.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have health insurance? How did you pay for the medical</br>   procedures?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I had regular medical, like everybody and I pay like $10 a month and</br>   they give me the best doctors. And when my son...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was that through the government?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And my son too, he have a major surgery because when he born</br>   his penis was inside.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So his urine conduct was stuck. So they needed a major surgery and I</br>   didn't pay anything. I paid with my medical and they sent me to the best</br>   doctors and he's okay. So for me, that's why I'm so grateful for USA, I</br>   love USA. So when this happened I was like, “Why?” I mean, I understand</br>   that not all the people that was to go to USA is going to be able because</br>   everyone wants to go over there. But I mean if we are working, we are</br>   paying taxes—they don't give taxes back. Just if you have kids, they give</br>   you $1,000 a year or something, but they don't give you more. And you still</br>   paying taxes. I mean the people we are without, even driving ticket or</br>   anything why they don't let us stay? Or like this family, they took my life</br>   away without knowing what they doing. It was easy for them to call</br>   immigration without thinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When they made claims about, well obviously you were undocumented,</br>   but they made claims also that you had engaged in a criminal acts as well?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They needed to call the police first. They can call the immigration</br>   first. So they called the local police and they say that I was robbing his</br>   home. And they have a fingerprints and I was like, “Yeah, sure. I was over</br>   there for four years or more.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh you lived with him?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you dated him. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I dated him. Yeah. So I mean the police man just told me you know</br>   that is not true. But they did their report because they want immigration</br>   to come to pick you up. They want you out of this. And they just did it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And even though the police did not really agree or think it was a</br>   valid claim, they had no—</br> </br> </br>   <span id="b95ddaed-5a43-4aad-b60b-7afb2046fd7e" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Ice, Treatment by">Rocio: They say I need to follow the report. And even the immigration guy,<br>
   he stopped in the middle of the road and he told me, “Who did this to you?”<br>
   I mean I told him my kids, my apartment, my car—because the police were<br>
   arriving and I was in a towel because I was in the shower and they don't<br>
   let me dress, so he took me to the police car and we wait for an hour. I<br>
   was in my towel and then immigration guy arrived and he told me, “What are<br>
   you doing almost naked here?” And I said, “Well he don't even let me get<br>
   pants or something.” So he let me get in my house, get dressed and he told<br>
   me, get your papers, your birth certificate for your kids and everything<br>
   you think you're going to need.<br>

   know what this is about. And it's just not because I went to United States<br>
   because I don't like Mexico or I come back and going to steal jobs because<br>
   I speak English because it's not that way. And the way we can help the<br>
   people that go through these situations and go to the government and ask<br>
   them—I'm here for nine years and I can't get a job and I'm 55 or I need to<br>
   support myself. I need to support my kids. I need to live. I'm Mexican and<br>
   I am not able to do nothing if you're in my country and it's terrible. And<br>
   that's what I'm going to fight for now. Because if not, I don't know if I'm<br>

  </span> Rocio: In a month I already rent my own studio. I get my furniture. So I</br>   was all set up in a month—and of course I compare the payment here in</br>   Mexico over there—and I just stay, I mean without thinking, without</br>   planning, I just stayed. After a year I came back because I wasn't sure if</br>   I'm going to stay or not in the USA. And I started working again here and</br>   when I was in the job, someone opened my purse and stole my wallet and I</br>   arrived to work and I just saw it and I was like, “No, I don't like this</br>   anymore so I'm going to come back to Palm Springs.” And I did. And I stayed</br>   for 18 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And that second time when you went back, did you go on a tourist visa</br>   as well?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So both times?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said almost immediately you were offered a job. What kind of</br>   job was it in the hotel?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I was cleaning rooms. Something very different of course, because I</br>   work here in an office and it was hard for me. But really it was the</br>   difference in the salaries, that just made the difference you know. To have</br>   my studio in a month and furniture and everything I hear is hard to do</br>   that. So, and then I was by myself. I wasn't married, I didn't have kids, I</br>   didn't even plan it, but I stay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you feel accepted or did it take time to feel accepted in the</br>   community?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, immediately, I always love the language. I studied English at my</br>   school here and I immediately loved it. I just love America and no, it was</br>   very good for me in Palm Springs. Everybody, it was Filipino people, a lot</br>   of Mexicans. And it was welcome. I was very welcome.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's nice. Was it, so you got a job, did you have employment papers</br>   or how did that work?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, we went to LA to buy a social security card. So I always, for 18</br>   years, I worked with that social security.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you pay taxes?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And I pay taxes. And after that, I work in hotels, in restaurants.</br>   In 95, I get married and I have a baby daughter, Karen, and I stay for</br>   three more years in hotels. And after I separated from my husband, I begin</br>   to work in private residence. Of course, they never asked me for papers,</br>   but I still paying my taxes, always I pay taxes. I helped the Palm Springs</br>   police for charities and everything. And my daughter have a problem with</br>   her heart. She have a murmur?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And I have the best doctors, I have her Medical. So, I start</br>   paying a charity for St. John's hospital for kids because I have the same</br>   problem. Thank God, she's okay. And, of course, these people start paying</br>   me more money because they were rich people. Because Palm Springs is in</br>   summer it's so hot, they go away for three, four months. So I take care of</br>   their residence. And I mean, United States for me, was very good. Very good</br>   because I always was welcome. Always have a job.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: After 13 years, I have another kid, Chris, my son. I didn't get</br>   married, I have been by myself. And then I start working for these</br>   people—the last persons that I worked for. And my boss brings a friend from</br>   Michigan, and we start dating since the beginning. And his family, he just</br>   told me they don't like Mexicans. So after four years—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Of dating?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Dating, they just call immigration and my nightmare starts and my</br>   life just was over, because I lost everything. Thank God my kids weren't</br>   with me that day. My daughter was with her dad and my son was with a friend</br>   of mine. So they took me just by myself. But that's when everything</br>   started. I didn't come to Mexico for 18 years. So it was just a nightmare.</br>   That's when everything started.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you still have contact with that man?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, he never called me. He never answered me again or anything. So I</br>   don't know if he had something to do with it or not or I don't know. I</br>   don't even want to because, I mean if I was by myself, okay. But it was my</br>   family [emphasis]. Even though I rent or everything, I have a very good</br>   apartment and all my furniture, my car—I was paying my car.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Could you get a license in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, I had a good one. But after 10 years here in Mexico, they</br>   changed the visa for 10 years. Every 10 years you need to change it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And that's when I started having problems because I didn't change</br>   the visa and so I lost my license, even though I was able to buy cars, to</br>   rent apartments and I never have a problem with that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you get credit cards and—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No credit card. No, it's just a bank account, but not credit cards.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your children grew up as Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. Yes. My daughter speaks English because I teach her at the</br>   beginning. And at school, she started speaking English. My son never want</br>   to speak Spanish. Since I start talking to him in Spanish and he never</br>   wanted it. So when I bring him, after a year that I came here, I took him,</br>   I tried to keep him with me, but it was hard because I get a job. So very</br>   early in the morning, I take him with my aunt and I pick him up at night in</br>   pajamas already. So it was crazy for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Here in Mexico. I took him to schools to see if I can register him.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And he was how old?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: He was three years old, almost three. And he don't speak Spanish or</br>   they don't let me, they just don't take him. So, it was like two months</br>   after I bring him, that my friend called me and told me, “We need to think,</br>   he have everything here, you know, he's an American citizen. What are you</br>   going to do over there with him? You don't have a place. You live with your</br>   mom.”</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So that's when I need to make that decision to let him go, with my</br>   friend. She's everything to me. Of course, she's very, very—a great family.</br>   She just have a son. So, she signed it like a tutor [inquisitive] to keep</br>   him until I was able to come back. Because at the beginning I was fighting</br>   to go back and talking with everybody, but they told me, you have 10 years</br>   and you need to stay over there. So it was extremely hard for me to make</br>   that decision, but it's not for me. It's his life. He has everything over</br>   there. And I'm not going to take that away from him.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my daughter was 13 and of course she was in middle school and I</br>   told her, “No, you need to stay over there and finish your school. You have</br>   your dad.” Of course, after three or four years, she began to not behave,</br>   you know, and she didn't finish high school. She just finished second. She</br>   just left one year, but she didn't finish and she started having problems</br>   with behavior, living with friends, and I didn't know anything. Her dad</br>   can't control her. So it was very hard for me. Very, very hard for me. Even</br>   though my son started peeing the bed for two or three years, my friend</br>   needs to take him to a psychologist. Saturday he turns 12, but he's 12</br>   years old. We talked with him and try to explain to him, but he really</br>   don't understand why I cannot cross the border. Why he cannot come over</br>   here because it's hard for him to cross without me. And of course he's</br>   still having problems sometimes with behavior or gain weight or lose weight</br>   or depression.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Of course, everything is a disaster. I was two years in bed with</br>   depression. My first two years, I just don't want to live. So, thanks to my</br>   family, help me and said, “Your kids needs you. You can't just die in bed.”</br>   So I went to see psychiatrist, and they give me medication and I stayed on</br>   medication. And so, after I don't know, like five years or six years of</br>   being here, I start like, “Okay, I need to get involved in this, what I can</br>   do to help people and help myself.” You know? Just start doing what I'm</br>   going to do, it's six years already.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers. They took all my money,</br>   thousand dollars every time. Everybody telling me they going to help me to</br>   go back. And of course until I say okay, no more paying to lawyers or</br>   anything. And I met Yolanda Verona, the one who wants to create more</br>   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in</br>   Mexico. And I said, “Okay, but I just opened a Facebook page and everybody</br>   are in United States.” So, I was like, “No, I need to meet people here.”</br>   But in Mexico, I haven't met anybody, just one, Ana Laura Lopez, and she's</br>   helping a lot people that came here—she waits for them in the airport and</br>   help them if they don't have place to stay or a job, or anything. But she</br>   lives so far from me, so we met once but we can't even talk, you know to do</br>   something together yet.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they're called DREAMer moms?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: DREAMers moms.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does she know Israel here in New Comienzos?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I think yes, I think yes. I think Israel told me that they need to</br>   meet her, but I don't know if they did already. And they introduced me to</br>   Gretchen—I don't know the last name. The movie director. Do you know it?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They introduced me to her and she's working in Relaciones exteriores</br>   here in the government. So she told me once that I need to contact her</br>   because I'm going to be already 10 years here and she can help me to start</br>   to see what I can have. If I can have a visa to go just for visit or if my</br>   daughter can ask for me because she's 22 already. Or start something to do,</br>   what I’m going to do… and to get my son's passport.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he can visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So he can come visit me. And the situation here that has been so</br>   difficult for me. That is just unbelievable that even in the United States</br>   without papers, I was able to get my car, to rent apartments and here in</br>   Mexico I can't. They asked me for a lot of papers and it's just the doors</br>   close for me here all the time. And because my age. I just been working—in</br>   nine years, I just got three jobs. And last year I broke a bone in my back.</br>   So I stay a year in bed. After that, I'd been looking for a job for a year</br>   and I'm not able to get a job because my age, so it's just a nightmare. And</br>   so I've been trying to get more involved in these situations, to see if we</br>   can get together, the people that we go through this and help each other</br>   because it's just crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I mean you get in internet to get a job and it's just until you're</br>   35 years old. So what would you want to do here? I mean, I speak enough</br>   English to work in an office and they tell me no because my age. So it's</br>   been hard all this time, even though my friend said, “Well you have already</br>   nine years here.” I said, “For me it's been like nine hours.” I mean it's</br>   been very difficult and go through everything. My kids is the worst part.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And is your daughter, does she still live in Palm Springs?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: She live in Palm Springs. She get a Mexican boyfriend and he don't</br>   have papers. So, she's helping him to get papers to go with her to the</br>   United States because she got—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is she back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: She's in North of Mexico, Sonora. She crossed the border and</br>   everything and the baby born in USA, praise God. But she's helping him and</br>   I can't see her because I don't have the money to bring her. Do you know</br>   the flights and everything? I mean, I have very much contact with her and</br>   with my boy. With him I talk—of course he don't have Facebook or</br>   anything—every 15 days and with my daughter every time she's on Facebook we</br>   talk. But she have a baby and I haven't meet him. He's going to be already</br>   two years old. So I don't know, it's just a nightmare.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like a nightmare?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And for everybody in my family needs to help me. I feel like I'm 15</br>   years old because they pay my rent. So it's just everything is—I tried to</br>   kill myself two years ago when I broke my back and they told me I need to</br>   be in bed for a year because I can't have surgery. So it was like, I can't</br>   do this anymore. You know, it's just, I can't, but it wasn't my time. I</br>   hurt myself in every way you can imagine. And at night, it was time. I</br>   didn't do it. I can't do it. So I started going to the psychiatrist again,</br>   and everything is money, so it's just, I don't know when this is going to</br>   end you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well hopefully, at least when the 10 years are up, you'll be able to</br>   find some way. It's temporary.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yeah, I hope so. I hope so too. I don't even know, just do think if</br>   I can go back and stay or I just want to for the moment, I just want to go</br>   and be able to cross the border to see my kid every time I'm able to. And</br>   of course I want to stay because the situation here with the jobs is just</br>   crazy and I just can't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You have such good English, it's really too bad—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes!</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That people don't take advantage of that.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So I'm just starting to get more strength to help people because you</br>   know, hearing the stories and everything—my stories all the time here in my</br>   mind. I'm starting to like it because I love to help people you know? And I</br>   start when the situation with the DACA start in United States, I was like,</br>   “This is not fair, this can't be happening.” I have thousands of friends in</br>   United States that took their kids very young, one, two years old. And the</br>   future was going to be for them, you know? And if they took the kids, the</br>   parent stay or if they took the parent back, what would the kids going to</br>   do in the United States? My kids were so lucky to have my daughter, her</br>   father, and my son, my friend. But even though that's illegal because they</br>   just have a paper, we haven't been able to do nothing really legal because</br>   it's too expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my friend wants to adopt my kid and I'm not ready to do that</br>   either. I'm not going to take my son away from her because she's been so</br>   nice, but I'm not going to sign that you know [laughs]? So I mean, it's</br>   just a nightmare for everybody. It's just not right. We don't go to steal</br>   nobody's jobs. We go to have a better life. That's it. And we are very</br>   hardworking people. So I don't know what's going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you think back about your time, what were your favorite things</br>   about the U.S?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Oh. Everything. I mean for me it was a very good time. I had very</br>   good jobs. I have time to be with my kids a lot because I worked nine to</br>   four, so I have all afternoon with my kids. I was able go to the beach. As</br>   you know, Palm Springs is very close to the beach, the snow, and mountains.</br>   So I love the USA. I just love that place. So I hope—I mean it's not going</br>   to be the same of course, but it's different. I just always love to be</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think living there changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. In a good way. Very good way. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me how.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: You know I was more involved with the community. Here? Never—just my</br>   friends said that's it. Over there they teach me how to be involved with</br>   the community. Like with the police community when they did in the park,</br>   events. And I always were there. Here, Mexico, it's not like that. And I</br>   like that a lot. And respect for the community, the way we drive over</br>   there. Here in Mexico is just crazy. When I used to drive, everybody was</br>   telling me what are you doing? Do you need to stop? You need to drive</br>   carefully. And I just get it immediately. I liked that respect for others.</br>   I just click with everything. I just love it.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And gives me the opportunity to have the best doctors for my kids</br>   and that you have schools that you don't need pay much. When that happened</br>   to me, I thought to bring my daughter and I don't know, going to be able to</br>   pay your school and I'm not going to put her in a public school here</br>   because the difference is going to be too much for her. So I decided to</br>   leave her over there. So everything, I like everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said your son has been having difficulties, emotional</br>   problems?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. Emotional problems. I, of course, keep in touch with my friend</br>   and she's like, well this week he was in a fight at school. He eats when he</br>   is upset or nervous. Sometimes for a month or two he's okay and they talk</br>   to him a lot. She's like his behavior at school sometimes is—I don't know</br>   because he have dark hair. Or I told her you ought to be careful with</br>   bullying, maybe it's that and she's not that very involved with him at</br>   school and everything. But sometimes, like right now, it's getting better.</br>   But when he's nervous …he gets in middle school already and he told my</br>   friend I'm very afraid to go to school. So he begins to eat and eat and</br>   right now he is very big. But we talked to him a lot so I don't know what's</br>   going to happen. It’s still problems with—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my daughter never forgive me. She all the time… I tried to tell</br>   her to know what to do with the baby or something and she said like, “Why</br>   you left me? So what you going to tell me about it?” And I say, “Karen</br>   you're 22 you need to understand.” And she is like, “No, you never, [pause]</br>   why'd you sign it for you to leave?” I mean she's very upset with me too, I</br>   don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't win. You said that one of your children, your daughter, had</br>   a heart murmur.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have health insurance? How did you pay for the medical</br>   procedures?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I had regular medical, like everybody and I pay like $10 a month and</br>   they give me the best doctors. And when my son...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was that through the government?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And my son too, he have a major surgery because when he born</br>   his penis was inside.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So his urine conduct was stuck. So they needed a major surgery and I</br>   didn't pay anything. I paid with my medical and they sent me to the best</br>   doctors and he's okay. So for me, that's why I'm so grateful for USA, I</br>   love USA. So when this happened I was like, “Why?” I mean, I understand</br>   that not all the people that was to go to USA is going to be able because</br>   everyone wants to go over there. But I mean if we are working, we are</br>   paying taxes—they don't give taxes back. Just if you have kids, they give</br>   you $1,000 a year or something, but they don't give you more. And you still</br>   paying taxes. I mean the people we are without, even driving ticket or</br>   anything why they don't let us stay? Or like this family, they took my life</br>   away without knowing what they doing. It was easy for them to call</br>   immigration without thinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When they made claims about, well obviously you were undocumented,</br>   but they made claims also that you had engaged in a criminal acts as well?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They needed to call the police first. They can call the immigration</br>   first. So they called the local police and they say that I was robbing his</br>   home. And they have a fingerprints and I was like, “Yeah, sure. I was over</br>   there for four years or more.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh you lived with him?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you dated him. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I dated him. Yeah. So I mean the police man just told me you know</br>   that is not true. But they did their report because they want immigration</br>   to come to pick you up. They want you out of this. And they just did it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And even though the police did not really agree or think it was a</br>   valid claim, they had no—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They say I need to follow the report. And even the immigration guy,</br>   he stopped in the middle of the road and he told me, “Who did this to you?”</br>   I mean I told him my kids, my apartment, my car—because the police were</br>   arriving and I was in a towel because I was in the shower and they don't</br>   let me dress, so he took me to the police car and we wait for an hour. I</br>   was in my towel and then immigration guy arrived and he told me, “What are</br>   you doing almost naked here?” And I said, “Well he don't even let me get</br>   pants or something.” So he let me get in my house, get dressed and he told</br>   me, get your papers, your birth certificate for your kids and everything</br>   you think you're going to need.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So I was lucky that he went with me in my home and then just start</br>   driving and he parked and he say, “Who did this to you?” And I was like,</br>   “Please let me go!” And he said, “I can't, I have the report and I need to</br>   arrive with you. But what you did or what is it?” I have my kids, I work, I</br>   paid taxes. He said “Sorry, I just can't let you go.” So they took me out</br>   [pause].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you left voluntarily, I mean it's not really voluntary, but you</br>   signed the papers and you left and they deported you? Was there an option</br>   to fight it?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I call, they tell me to call here to Relaciones exteriors (Mexican</br>   Consulate), to the government here. And I did call and they told me, “You</br>   just sign. Because if they take you to the judge and the judge deport you,</br>   you never going to come back.” So in the moment I was like, of course in</br>   shock, I was thinking about my kids. I was like what I need to do to don't</br>   have more problems. Just sign, you need to sign, you don't go to the judge</br>   because they going to deport you or they going to take your kids away and</br>   blah, blah, blah. So I just signed.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I'm so sorry. So sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, it's hard. I mean, I know my kids is thanks to my family and</br>   the people around me. It's been not crazy like other peoples, other people</br>   it's terrible. Anyway, if you have family, they destroyed your family. Even</br>   though I get back to my kids one day is not to be the same never.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They're American citizens. There's no reason that the U.S Government</br>   should be destroying their lives.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yeah. They are destroying an American citizen because they are</br>   suffering. And it's just not fair. But I'm very glad that people like you</br>   are doing this because what I want is to be able to talk to more people, to</br>   know what this is about. And it's just not because I went to United States</br>   because I don't like Mexico or I come back and going to steal jobs because</br>   I speak English because it's not that way. And the way we can help the</br>   people that go through these situations and go to the government and ask</br>   them—I'm here for nine years and I can't get a job and I'm 55 or I need to</br>   support myself. I need to support my kids. I need to live. I'm Mexican and</br>   I am not able to do nothing if you're in my country and it's terrible. And</br>   that's what I'm going to fight for now. Because if not, I don't know if I'm</br>   going to survive or what am I going to do. My family is not going to be</br>   there forever.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So it's hard, difficult. But thank you very much for doing this.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well, thank you so much. And I think you're a very strong person and</br>   I think you're going to, you know, in another year, hopefully you'll see</br>   your family and find some way to reconcile all this in a positive way.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And I think this is going to give me the strength to, if I go</br>   back and fight more and more for these situations. It's terrible. We need</br>   to do something about it.</br> </div><\p></p>
