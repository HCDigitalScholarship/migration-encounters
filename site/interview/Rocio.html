What was</br>   it like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Well it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">1991</span>. I wasn't working here and I had a friend that came</br>   from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Hawaii</span> and asked me if I want to go for a vacation. And I said yes and</br>   I arrived to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palm Springs</span>. Beautiful place. I just love it. And immediately</br>   he asked me if I want to get a job because across our apartment they were</br>   asking for people who want to work in a hotel. And I went to apply and they</br>   gave me the job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month</span> I already rent my own studio. I get my furniture. So I</br>   was all set up in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month</span>—and of course I compare the payment here in</br>   Mexico over there—and I just stay, I mean without thinking, without</br>   planning, I just stayed. After <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> I came back because I wasn't sure if</br>   I'm going to stay or not in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span>. And I started working again here and</br>   when I was in the job, someone opened my purse and stole my wallet and I</br>   arrived to work and I just saw it and I was like, “No, I don't like this</br>   anymore so I'm going to come back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palm Springs</span>.” And I did. And I stayed</br>   for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18 years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time when you went back, did you go on a tourist visa</br>   as well?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So both times?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you said almost immediately you were offered a job. What kind of</br>   job was it in the hotel?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: I was cleaning rooms. Something very different of course, because I</br>   work here in an office and it was hard for me. But really it was the</br>   difference in the salaries, that just made the difference you know. To have</br>   my studio in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month</span> and furniture and everything I hear is hard to do</br>   that. So, and then I was by myself. I wasn't married, I didn't have kids, I</br>   didn't even plan it, but I stay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And did you feel accepted or did it take time to feel accepted in the</br>   community?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: No, immediately, I always love the language. I studied <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> at my</br>   school here and I immediately loved it. I just love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span> and no, it was</br>   very good for me in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palm Springs</span>. Everybody, it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Filipino</span> people, a lot</br>   of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. And it was welcome. I was very welcome.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's nice. Was it, so you got a job, did you have employment papers</br>   or how did that work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: No, we went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span> to buy a social security card. So I always, for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18   years</span>, I worked with that social security.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And did you pay taxes?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: And I pay taxes. And after that, I work in hotels, in restaurants.</br>   In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">95</span>, I get married and I have a baby daughter, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Karen</span>, and I stay for</br>   three more years in hotels. And after I separated from my husband, I begin</br>   to work in private residence. Of course, they never asked me for papers,</br>   but I still paying my taxes, always I pay taxes. I helped the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palm Springs</span></br>   police for charities and everything. And my daughter have a problem with</br>   her heart. She have a murmur?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes. And I have the best doctors, I have her Medical. So, I start</br>   paying a charity for St. John's hospital for kids because I have the same</br>   problem. Thank God, she's okay. And, of course, these people start paying</br>   me more money because they were rich people. Because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palm Springs</span> is in</br>   summer it's so hot, they go away for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three, four months</span>. So I take care of</br>   their residence. And I mean, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span> for me, was very good. Very good</br>   because I always was welcome. Always have a job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: After <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13 years</span>, I have another kid, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Chris</span>, my son. I didn't get</br>   married, I have been by myself. And then I start working for these</br>   people—the last persons that I worked for. And my boss brings a friend from</br>   Michigan, and we start dating since the beginning. And his family, he just</br>   told me they don't like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. So after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four years</span>—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Of dating?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Dating, they just call immigration and my nightmare starts and my</br>   life just was over, because I lost everything. Thank God my kids weren't</br>   with me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">that day</span>. My daughter was with her dad and my son was with a friend</br>   of mine. So they took me just by myself. But that's when everything</br>   started. I didn't come to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18 years</span>. So it was just a nightmare.</br>   That's when everything started.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you still have contact with that man?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did he?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: No, he never called me. He never answered me again or anything. So I</br>   don't know if he had something to do with it or not or I don't know. I</br>   don't even want to because, I mean if I was by myself, okay. But it was my</br>   family [emphasis]. Even though I rent or everything, I have a very good</br>   apartment and all my furniture, my car—I was paying my car.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Could you get a license in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes, I had a good one. But after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span> here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, they</br>   changed the visa for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span>. Every 10 years you need to change it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: And that's when I started having problems because I didn't change</br>   the visa and so I lost my license, even though I was able to buy cars, to</br>   rent apartments and I never have a problem with that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you get credit cards and—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: No credit card. No, it's just a bank account, but not credit cards.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And your children grew up as <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes. Yes. My daughter speaks <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> because I teach her at the</br>   beginning. And at school, she started speaking <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. My son never want</br>   to speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. Since I start talking to him in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and he never</br>   wanted it. So when I bring him, after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> that I came here, I took him,</br>   I tried to keep him with me, but it was hard because I get a job. So very</br>   early in the morning, I take him with my aunt and I pick him up at night in</br>   pajamas already. So it was crazy for me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I took him to schools to see if I can register him.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And he was how old?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: He was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years old</span>, almost <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three</span>. And he don't speak Spanish or</br>   they don't let me, they just don't take him. So, it was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two months</span></br>   after I bring him, that my friend called me and told me, “We need to think,</br>   he have everything here, you know, he's an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizen. What are you</br>   going to do over there with him? You don't have a place. You live with your</br>   mom.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: So that's when I need to make that decision to let him go, with my</br>   friend. She's everything to me. Of course, she's very, very—a great family.</br>   She just have a son. So, she signed it like a tutor [inquisitive] to keep</br>   him until I was able to come back. Because at the beginning I was fighting</br>   to go back and talking with everybody, but they told me, you have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span></br>   and you need to stay over there. So it was extremely hard for me to make</br>   that decision, but it's not for me. It's his life. He has everything over</br>   there. And I'm not going to take that away from him.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: And my daughter was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span> and of course she was in middle school and I</br>   told her, “No, you need to stay over there and finish your school. You have</br>   your dad.” Of course, after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three or four years</span>, she began to not behave,</br>   you know, and she didn't finish high school. She just finished <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span>. She</br>   just left <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span>, but she didn't finish and she started having problems</br>   with behavior, living with friends, and I didn't know anything. Her dad</br>   can't control her. So it was very hard for me. Very, very hard for me. Even</br>   though my son started peeing the bed for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two or three years</span>, my friend</br>   needs to take him to a psychologist. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Saturday</span> he turns <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span>, but he's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12   years old</span>. We talked with him and try to explain to him, but he really</br>   don't understand why I cannot cross the border. Why he cannot come over</br>   here because it's hard for him to cross without me. And of course he's</br>   still having problems sometimes with behavior or gain weight or lose weight</br>   or depression.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Of course, everything is a disaster. I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> in bed with</br>   depression. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">My first two years</span>, I just don't want to live. So, thanks to my</br>   family, help me and said, “Your kids needs you. You can't just die in bed.”</br>   So I went to see psychiatrist, and they give me medication and I stayed on</br>   medication. And so, after I don't know, like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five years</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six years</span> of</br>   being here, I start like, “Okay, I need to get involved in this, what I can</br>   do to help people and help myself.” You know? Just start doing what I'm</br>   going to do, it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six years</span> already.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers. They took all my money,</br>   thousand dollars every time. Everybody telling me they going to help me to</br>   go back. And of course until I say okay, no more paying to lawyers or</br>   anything. And I met <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Yolanda Verona</span>, the one who wants to create more</br>   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in</br>   Mexico. And I said, “Okay, but I just opened a Facebook page and everybody</br>   are in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>.” So, I was like, “No, I need to meet people here.”</br>   But in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I haven't met anybody, just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ana Laura Lopez</span>, and she's</br>   helping a lot people that came here—she waits for them in the airport and</br>   help them if they don't have place to stay or a job, or anything. But she</br>   lives so far from me, so we met once but we can't even talk, you know to do</br>   something together yet.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And they're called DREAMer moms?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: DREAMers moms.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Does she know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Israel</span> here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New Comienzos</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: I think yes, I think yes. I think <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Israel</span> told me that they need to</br>   meet her, but I don't know if they did already. And they introduced me to</br>   Gretchen—I don't know the last name. The movie director. Do you know it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: They introduced me to her and she's working in Relaciones exteriores</br>   here in the government. So she told me once that I need to contact her</br>   because I'm going to be already <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span> here and she can help me to start</br>   to see what I can have. If I can have a visa to go just for visit or if my</br>   daughter can ask for me because she's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">22</span> already. Or start something to do,</br>   what I’m going to do… and to get my son's passport.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So he can visit you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: So he can come visit me. And the situation here that has been so</br>   difficult for me. That is just unbelievable that even in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span></br>   without papers, I was able to get my car, to rent apartments and here in</br>   Mexico I can't. They asked me for a lot of papers and it's just the doors</br>   close for me here all the time. And because my age. I just been working—in</br>   nine years, I just got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> jobs. And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">last year</span> I broke a bone in my back.</br>   So I stay <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> in bed. After that, I'd been looking for a job for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span></br>   and I'm not able to get a job because my age, so it's just a nightmare. And</br>   so I've been trying to get more involved in these situations, to see if we</br>   can get together, the people that we go through this and help each other</br>   because it's just crazy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: I mean you get in internet to get a job and it's just until you're</br>   35 years old. So what would you want to do here? I mean, I speak enough</br>   English to work in an office and they tell me no because my age. So it's</br>   been hard all this time, even though my friend said, “Well you have already</br>   nine years here.” I said, “For me it's been like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">nine hours</span>.” I mean it's</br>   been very difficult and go through everything. My kids is the worst part.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And is your daughter, does she still live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palm Springs</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: She live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palm Springs</span>. She get a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> boyfriend and he don't</br>   have papers. So, she's helping him to get papers to go with her to the</br>   United States because she got—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is she back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: She's in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">North of Mexico</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Sonora</span>. She crossed the border and</br>   everything and the baby born in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span>, praise God. But she's helping him and</br>   I can't see her because I don't have the money to bring her. Do you know</br>   the flights and everything? I mean, I have very much contact with her and</br>   with my boy. With him I talk—of course he don't have Facebook or</br>   anything—<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every 15 days</span> and with my daughter every time she's on Facebook we</br>   talk. But she have a baby and I haven't meet him. He's going to be already</br>   two years old. So I don't know, it's just a nightmare.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Like a nightmare?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: And for everybody in my family needs to help me. I feel like I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15   years old</span> because they pay my rent. So it's just everything is—I tried to</br>   kill myself <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years ago</span> when I broke my back and they told me I need to</br>   be in bed for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> because I can't have surgery. So it was like, I can't</br>   do this anymore. You know, it's just, I can't, but it wasn't my time. I</br>   hurt myself in every way you can imagine. And at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">night</span>, it was time. I</br>   didn't do it. I can't do it. So I started going to the psychiatrist again,</br>   and everything is money, so it's just, I don't know when this is going to</br>   end you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Well hopefully, at least when <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the 10 years</span> are up, you'll be able to</br>   find some way. It's temporary.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yeah, I hope so. I hope so too. I don't even know, just do think if</br>   I can go back and stay or I just want to for the moment, I just want to go</br>   and be able to cross the border to see my kid every time I'm able to. And</br>   of course I want to stay because the situation here with the jobs is just</br>   crazy and I just can't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You have such good <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, it's really too bad—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes!</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That people don't take advantage of that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: So I'm just starting to get more strength to help people because you</br>   know, hearing the stories and everything—my stories all the time here in my</br>   mind. I'm starting to like it because I love to help people you know? And I</br>   start when the situation with the DACA start in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>, I was like,</br>   “This is not fair, this can't be happening.” I have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">thousands</span> of friends in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span> that took their kids very young, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span>, two years old. And the</br>   future was going to be for them, you know? And if they took the kids, the</br>   parent stay or if they took the parent back, what would the kids going to</br>   do in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>? My kids were so lucky to have my daughter, her</br>   father, and my son, my friend. But even though that's illegal because they</br>   just have a paper, we haven't been able to do nothing really legal because</br>   it's too expensive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: And my friend wants to adopt my kid and I'm not ready to do that</br>   either. I'm not going to take my son away from her because she's been so</br>   nice, but I'm not going to sign that you know [laughs]? So I mean, it's</br>   just a nightmare for everybody. It's just not right. We don't go to steal</br>   nobody's jobs. We go to have a better life. That's it. And we are very</br>   hardworking people. So I don't know what's going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: When you think back about your time, what were your favorite things</br>   about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Oh. Everything. I mean for me it was a very good time. I had very</br>   good jobs. I have time to be with my kids a lot because I worked <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">nine to   </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span>, so I have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">all afternoon</span> with my kids. I was able go to the beach. As</br>   you know, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palm Springs</span> is very close to the beach, the snow, and mountains.</br>   So I love the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span>. I just love that place. So I hope—I mean it's not going</br>   to be the same of course, but it's different. I just always love to be</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think living there changed you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes. In a good way. Very good way. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Tell me how.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: You know I was more involved with the community. Here? Never—just my</br>   friends said that's it. Over there they teach me how to be involved with</br>   the community. Like with the police community when they did in the park,</br>   events. And I always were there. Here, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, it's not like that. And I</br>   like that a lot. And respect for the community, the way we drive over</br>   there. Here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is just crazy. When I used to drive, everybody was</br>   telling me what are you doing? Do you need to stop? You need to drive</br>   carefully. And I just get it immediately. I liked that respect for others.</br>   I just click with everything. I just love it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: And gives me the opportunity to have the best doctors for my kids</br>   and that you have schools that you don't need pay much. When that happened</br>   to me, I thought to bring my daughter and I don't know, going to be able to</br>   pay your school and I'm not going to put her in a public school here</br>   because the difference is going to be too much for her. So I decided to</br>   leave her over there. So everything, I like everything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you said your son has been having difficulties, emotional</br>   problems?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes. Emotional problems. I, of course, keep in touch with my friend</br>   and she's like, well <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">this week</span> he was in a fight at school. He eats when he</br>   is upset or nervous. Sometimes for a month or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> he's okay and they talk</br>   to him a lot. She's like his behavior at school sometimes is—I don't know</br>   because he have dark hair. Or I told her you ought to be careful with</br>   bullying, maybe it's that and she's not that very involved with him at</br>   school and everything. But sometimes, like right now, it's getting better.</br>   But when he's nervous …he gets in middle school already and he told my</br>   friend I'm very afraid to go to school. So he begins to eat and eat and</br>   right now he is very big. But we talked to him a lot so I don't know what's</br>   going to happen. It’s still problems with—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: And my daughter never forgive me. She all the time… I tried to tell</br>   her to know what to do with the baby or something and she said like, “Why</br>   you left me? So what you going to tell me about it?” And I say, “Karen</br>   you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">22</span> you need to understand.” And she is like, “No, you never, [pause]</br>   why'd you sign it for you to leave?” I mean she's very upset with me too, I</br>   don't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You can't win. You said that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of your children, your daughter, had</br>   a heart murmur.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you have health insurance? How did you pay for the medical</br>   procedures?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: I had regular medical, like everybody and I pay like $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">10</span> a month and</br>   they give me the best doctors. And when my son...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was that through the government?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes. And my son too, he have a major surgery because when he born</br>   his penis was inside.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: So his urine conduct was stuck. So they needed a major surgery and I</br>   didn't pay anything. I paid with my medical and they sent me to the best</br>   doctors and he's okay. So for me, that's why I'm so grateful for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span>, I</br>   love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span>. So when this happened I was like, “Why?” I mean, I understand</br>   that not all the people that was to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span> is going to be able because</br>   everyone wants to go over there. But I mean if we are working, we are</br>   paying taxes—they don't give taxes back. Just if you have kids, they give</br>   you $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">1,000</span> a year or something, but they don't give you more. And you still</br>   paying taxes. I mean the people we are without, even driving ticket or</br>   anything why they don't let us stay? Or like this family, they took my life</br>   away without knowing what they doing. It was easy for them to call</br>   immigration without thinking.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: When they made claims about, well obviously you were undocumented,</br>   but they made claims also that you had engaged in a criminal acts as well?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: They needed to call the police <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. They can call the immigration</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. So they called the local police and they say that I was robbing his</br>   home. And they have a fingerprints and I was like, “Yeah, sure. I was over</br>   there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four years</span> or more.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh you lived with him?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: But you dated him. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: I dated him. Yeah. So I mean the police man just told me you know</br>   that is not true. But they did their report because they want immigration</br>   to come to pick you up. They want you out of this. And they just did it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And even though the police did not really agree or think it was a</br>   valid claim, they had no—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: They say I need to follow the report. And even the immigration guy,</br>   he stopped in the middle of the road and he told me, “Who did this to you?”</br>   I mean I told him my kids, my apartment, my car—because the police were</br>   arriving and I was in a towel because I was in the shower and they don't</br>   let me dress, so he took me to the police car and we wait for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">an hour</span>. I</br>   was in my towel and then immigration guy arrived and he told me, “What are</br>   you doing almost naked here?” And I said, “Well he don't even let me get</br>   pants or something.” So he let me get in my house, get dressed and he told</br>   me, get your papers, your birth certificate for your kids and everything</br>   you think you're going to need.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: So I was lucky that he went with me in my home and then just start</br>   driving and he parked and he say, “Who did this to you?” And I was like,</br>   “Please let me go!” And he said, “I can't, I have the report and I need to</br>   arrive with you. But what you did or what is it?” I have my kids, I work, I</br>   paid taxes. He said “Sorry, I just can't let you go.” So they took me out</br>   [pause].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you left voluntarily, I mean it's not really voluntary, but you</br>   signed the papers and you left and they deported you? Was there an option</br>   to fight it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: I call, they tell me to call here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Relaciones exteriors</span> (<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Mexican   Consulate</span>), to the government here. And I did call and they told me, “You</br>   just sign. Because if they take you to the judge and the judge deport you,</br>   you never going to come back.” So in the moment I was like, of course in</br>   shock, I was thinking about my kids. I was like what I need to do to don't</br>   have more problems. Just sign, you need to sign, you don't go to the judge</br>   because they going to deport you or they going to take your kids away and</br>   blah, blah, blah. So I just signed.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I'm so sorry. So sorry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yes, it's hard. I mean, I know my kids is thanks to my family and</br>   the people around me. It's been not crazy like other peoples, other people</br>   it's terrible. Anyway, if you have family, they destroyed your family. Even</br>   though I get back to my kids <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one day</span> is not to be the same never.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: They're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizens. There's no reason that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S</span> Government</br>   should be destroying their lives.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: Yeah. They are destroying an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> citizen because they are</br>   suffering. And it's just not fair. But I'm very glad that people like you</br>   are doing this because what I want is to be able to talk to more people, to</br>   know what this is about. And it's just not because I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span></br>   because I don't like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> or I come back and going to steal jobs because</br>   I speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> because it's not that way. And the way we can help the</br>   people that go through these situations and go to the government and ask</br>   them—I'm here for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nine years</span> and I can't get a job and I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">55</span> or I need to</br>   support myself. I need to support my kids. I need to live. I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> and</br>   I am not able to do nothing if you're in my country and it's terrible. And</br>   that's what I'm going to fight for now. Because if not, I don't know if I'm</br>   going to survive or what am I going to do. My family is not going to be</br>   there forever.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span>: So it's hard, difficult. But thank you very much for doing this.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Well, thank you so much. And I think you're a very strong person and</br>   I think you're going to, you know, in another year, hopefully you'll see</br>   your family and find some way to reconcile all this in a positive way.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Rocio</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife, Living situation">Rocio: Well it was 1991. I wasn't working here and I had a friend that came   from Hawaii and asked me if I want to go for a vacation. And I said yes and   I arrived to Palm Springs. Beautiful place. I just love it. And immediately   he asked me if I want to get a job because across our apartment they were   asking for people who want to work in a hotel. And I went to apply and they   gave me the job.    </span> Rocio: In a month I already rent my own studio. I get my furniture. So I</br>   was all set up in a month—and of course I compare the payment here in</br>   Mexico over there—and I just stay, I mean without thinking, without</br>   planning, I just stayed. After a year I came back because I wasn't sure if</br>   I'm going to stay or not in the USA. And I started working again here and</br>   when I was in the job, someone opened my purse and stole my wallet and I</br>   arrived to work and I just saw it and I was like, “No, I don't like this</br>   anymore so I'm going to come back to Palm Springs.” And I did. And I stayed</br>   for 18 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And that second time when you went back, did you go on a tourist visa</br>   as well?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So both times?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said almost immediately you were offered a job. What kind of</br>   job was it in the hotel?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I was cleaning rooms. Something very different of course, because I</br>   work here in an office and it was hard for me. But really it was the</br>   difference in the salaries, that just made the difference you know. To have</br>   my studio in a month and furniture and everything I hear is hard to do</br>   that. So, and then I was by myself. I wasn't married, I didn't have kids, I</br>   didn't even plan it, but I stay.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you feel accepted or did it take time to feel accepted in the</br>   community?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, immediately, I always love the language. I studied English at my</br>   school here and I immediately loved it. I just love America and no, it was</br>   very good for me in Palm Springs. Everybody, it was Filipino people, a lot</br>   of Mexicans. And it was welcome. I was very welcome.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's nice. Was it, so you got a job, did you have employment papers</br>   or how did that work?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, we went to LA to buy a social security card. So I always, for 18</br>   years, I worked with that social security.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And did you pay taxes?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And I pay taxes. And after that, I work in hotels, in restaurants.</br>   In 95, I get married and I have a baby daughter, Karen, and I stay for</br>   three more years in hotels. And after I separated from my husband, I begin</br>   to work in private residence. Of course, they never asked me for papers,</br>   but I still paying my taxes, always I pay taxes. I helped the Palm Springs</br>   police for charities and everything. And my daughter have a problem with</br>   her heart. She have a murmur?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And I have the best doctors, I have her Medical. So, I start</br>   paying a charity for St. John's hospital for kids because I have the same</br>   problem. Thank God, she's okay. And, of course, these people start paying</br>   me more money because they were rich people. Because Palm Springs is in</br>   summer it's so hot, they go away for three, four months. So I take care of</br>   their residence. And I mean, United States for me, was very good. Very good</br>   because I always was welcome. Always have a job.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: After 13 years, I have another kid, Chris, my son. I didn't get</br>   married, I have been by myself. And then I start working for these</br>   people—the last persons that I worked for. And my boss brings a friend from</br>   Michigan, and we start dating since the beginning. And his family, he just</br>   told me they don't like Mexicans. So after four years—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Of dating?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Dating, they just call immigration and my nightmare starts and my</br>   life just was over, because I lost everything. Thank God my kids weren't</br>   with me that day. My daughter was with her dad and my son was with a friend</br>   of mine. So they took me just by myself. But that's when everything</br>   started. I didn't come to Mexico for 18 years. So it was just a nightmare.</br>   That's when everything started.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you still have contact with that man?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No, he never called me. He never answered me again or anything. So I</br>   don't know if he had something to do with it or not or I don't know. I</br>   don't even want to because, I mean if I was by myself, okay. But it was my</br>   family [emphasis]. Even though I rent or everything, I have a very good</br>   apartment and all my furniture, my car—I was paying my car.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Could you get a license in California?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, I had a good one. But after 10 years here in Mexico, they</br>   changed the visa for 10 years. Every 10 years you need to change it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And that's when I started having problems because I didn't change</br>   the visa and so I lost my license, even though I was able to buy cars, to</br>   rent apartments and I never have a problem with that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you get credit cards and—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No credit card. No, it's just a bank account, but not credit cards.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your children grew up as Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. Yes. My daughter speaks English because I teach her at the</br>   beginning. And at school, she started speaking English. My son never want</br>   to speak Spanish. Since I start talking to him in Spanish and he never</br>   wanted it. So when I bring him, after a year that I came here, I took him,</br>   I tried to keep him with me, but it was hard because I get a job. So very</br>   early in the morning, I take him with my aunt and I pick him up at night in</br>   pajamas already. So it was crazy for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Here in Mexico. I took him to schools to see if I can register him.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And he was how old?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: He was three years old, almost three. And he don't speak Spanish or</br>   they don't let me, they just don't take him. So, it was like two months</br>   after I bring him, that my friend called me and told me, “We need to think,</br>   he have everything here, you know, he's an American citizen. What are you</br>   going to do over there with him? You don't have a place. You live with your</br>   mom.”</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So that's when I need to make that decision to let him go, with my</br>   friend. She's everything to me. Of course, she's very, very—a great family.</br>   She just have a son. So, she signed it like a tutor [inquisitive] to keep</br>   him until I was able to come back. Because at the beginning I was fighting</br>   to go back and talking with everybody, but they told me, you have 10 years</br>   and you need to stay over there. So it was extremely hard for me to make</br>   that decision, but it's not for me. It's his life. He has everything over</br>   there. And I'm not going to take that away from him.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my daughter was 13 and of course she was in middle school and I</br>   told her, “No, you need to stay over there and finish your school. You have</br>   your dad.” Of course, after three or four years, she began to not behave,</br>   you know, and she didn't finish high school. She just finished second. She</br>   just left one year, but she didn't finish and she started having problems</br>   with behavior, living with friends, and I didn't know anything. Her dad</br>   can't control her. So it was very hard for me. Very, very hard for me. Even</br>   though my son started peeing the bed for two or three years, my friend</br>   needs to take him to a psychologist. Saturday he turns 12, but he's 12</br>   years old. We talked with him and try to explain to him, but he really</br>   don't understand why I cannot cross the border. Why he cannot come over</br>   here because it's hard for him to cross without me. And of course he's</br>   still having problems sometimes with behavior or gain weight or lose weight</br>   or depression.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Of course, everything is a disaster. I was two years in bed with</br>   depression. My first two years, I just don't want to live. So, thanks to my</br>   family, help me and said, “Your kids needs you. You can't just die in bed.”</br>   So I went to see psychiatrist, and they give me medication and I stayed on</br>   medication. And so, after I don't know, like five years or six years of</br>   being here, I start like, “Okay, I need to get involved in this, what I can</br>   do to help people and help myself.” You know? Just start doing what I'm</br>   going to do, it's six years already.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers. They took all my money,</br>   thousand dollars every time. Everybody telling me they going to help me to</br>   go back. And of course until I say okay, no more paying to lawyers or</br>   anything. And I met Yolanda Verona, the one who wants to create more</br>   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in</br>   Mexico. And I said, “Okay, but I just opened a Facebook page and everybody</br>   are in United States.” So, I was like, “No, I need to meet people here.”</br>   But in Mexico, I haven't met anybody, just one, Ana Laura Lopez, and she's</br>   helping a lot people that came here—she waits for them in the airport and</br>   help them if they don't have place to stay or a job, or anything. But she</br>   lives so far from me, so we met once but we can't even talk, you know to do</br>   something together yet.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they're called DREAMer moms?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: DREAMers moms.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does she know Israel here in New Comienzos?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I think yes, I think yes. I think Israel told me that they need to</br>   meet her, but I don't know if they did already. And they introduced me to</br>   Gretchen—I don't know the last name. The movie director. Do you know it?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They introduced me to her and she's working in Relaciones exteriores</br>   here in the government. So she told me once that I need to contact her</br>   because I'm going to be already 10 years here and she can help me to start</br>   to see what I can have. If I can have a visa to go just for visit or if my</br>   daughter can ask for me because she's 22 already. Or start something to do,</br>   what I’m going to do… and to get my son's passport.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he can visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So he can come visit me. And the situation here that has been so</br>   difficult for me. That is just unbelievable that even in the United States</br>   without papers, I was able to get my car, to rent apartments and here in</br>   Mexico I can't. They asked me for a lot of papers and it's just the doors</br>   close for me here all the time. And because my age. I just been working—in</br>   nine years, I just got three jobs. And last year I broke a bone in my back.</br>   So I stay a year in bed. After that, I'd been looking for a job for a year</br>   and I'm not able to get a job because my age, so it's just a nightmare. And</br>   so I've been trying to get more involved in these situations, to see if we</br>   can get together, the people that we go through this and help each other</br>   because it's just crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I mean you get in internet to get a job and it's just until you're</br>   35 years old. So what would you want to do here? I mean, I speak enough</br>   English to work in an office and they tell me no because my age. So it's</br>   been hard all this time, even though my friend said, “Well you have already</br>   nine years here.” I said, “For me it's been like nine hours.” I mean it's</br>   been very difficult and go through everything. My kids is the worst part.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And is your daughter, does she still live in Palm Springs?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: She live in Palm Springs. She get a Mexican boyfriend and he don't</br>   have papers. So, she's helping him to get papers to go with her to the</br>   United States because she got—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is she back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: She's in North of Mexico, Sonora. She crossed the border and</br>   everything and the baby born in USA, praise God. But she's helping him and</br>   I can't see her because I don't have the money to bring her. Do you know</br>   the flights and everything? I mean, I have very much contact with her and</br>   with my boy. With him I talk—of course he don't have Facebook or</br>   anything—every 15 days and with my daughter every time she's on Facebook we</br>   talk. But she have a baby and I haven't meet him. He's going to be already</br>   two years old. So I don't know, it's just a nightmare.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like a nightmare?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And for everybody in my family needs to help me. I feel like I'm 15</br>   years old because they pay my rent. So it's just everything is—I tried to</br>   kill myself two years ago when I broke my back and they told me I need to</br>   be in bed for a year because I can't have surgery. So it was like, I can't</br>   do this anymore. You know, it's just, I can't, but it wasn't my time. I</br>   hurt myself in every way you can imagine. And at night, it was time. I</br>   didn't do it. I can't do it. So I started going to the psychiatrist again,</br>   and everything is money, so it's just, I don't know when this is going to</br>   end you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well hopefully, at least when the 10 years are up, you'll be able to</br>   find some way. It's temporary.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yeah, I hope so. I hope so too. I don't even know, just do think if</br>   I can go back and stay or I just want to for the moment, I just want to go</br>   and be able to cross the border to see my kid every time I'm able to. And</br>   of course I want to stay because the situation here with the jobs is just</br>   crazy and I just can't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You have such good English, it's really too bad—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes!</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That people don't take advantage of that.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So I'm just starting to get more strength to help people because you</br>   know, hearing the stories and everything—my stories all the time here in my</br>   mind. I'm starting to like it because I love to help people you know? And I</br>   start when the situation with the DACA start in United States, I was like,</br>   “This is not fair, this can't be happening.” I have thousands of friends in</br>   United States that took their kids very young, one, two years old. And the</br>   future was going to be for them, you know? And if they took the kids, the</br>   parent stay or if they took the parent back, what would the kids going to</br>   do in the United States? My kids were so lucky to have my daughter, her</br>   father, and my son, my friend. But even though that's illegal because they</br>   just have a paper, we haven't been able to do nothing really legal because</br>   it's too expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my friend wants to adopt my kid and I'm not ready to do that</br>   either. I'm not going to take my son away from her because she's been so</br>   nice, but I'm not going to sign that you know [laughs]? So I mean, it's</br>   just a nightmare for everybody. It's just not right. We don't go to steal</br>   nobody's jobs. We go to have a better life. That's it. And we are very</br>   hardworking people. So I don't know what's going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you think back about your time, what were your favorite things</br>   about the U.S?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Oh. Everything. I mean for me it was a very good time. I had very</br>   good jobs. I have time to be with my kids a lot because I worked nine to</br>   four, so I have all afternoon with my kids. I was able go to the beach. As</br>   you know, Palm Springs is very close to the beach, the snow, and mountains.</br>   So I love the USA. I just love that place. So I hope—I mean it's not going</br>   to be the same of course, but it's different. I just always love to be</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think living there changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. In a good way. Very good way. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me how.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: You know I was more involved with the community. Here? Never—just my</br>   friends said that's it. Over there they teach me how to be involved with</br>   the community. Like with the police community when they did in the park,</br>   events. And I always were there. Here, Mexico, it's not like that. And I</br>   like that a lot. And respect for the community, the way we drive over</br>   there. Here in Mexico is just crazy. When I used to drive, everybody was</br>   telling me what are you doing? Do you need to stop? You need to drive</br>   carefully. And I just get it immediately. I liked that respect for others.</br>   I just click with everything. I just love it.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And gives me the opportunity to have the best doctors for my kids</br>   and that you have schools that you don't need pay much. When that happened</br>   to me, I thought to bring my daughter and I don't know, going to be able to</br>   pay your school and I'm not going to put her in a public school here</br>   because the difference is going to be too much for her. So I decided to</br>   leave her over there. So everything, I like everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said your son has been having difficulties, emotional</br>   problems?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. Emotional problems. I, of course, keep in touch with my friend</br>   and she's like, well this week he was in a fight at school. He eats when he</br>   is upset or nervous. Sometimes for a month or two he's okay and they talk</br>   to him a lot. She's like his behavior at school sometimes is—I don't know</br>   because he have dark hair. Or I told her you ought to be careful with</br>   bullying, maybe it's that and she's not that very involved with him at</br>   school and everything. But sometimes, like right now, it's getting better.</br>   But when he's nervous …he gets in middle school already and he told my</br>   friend I'm very afraid to go to school. So he begins to eat and eat and</br>   right now he is very big. But we talked to him a lot so I don't know what's</br>   going to happen. It’s still problems with—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my daughter never forgive me. She all the time… I tried to tell</br>   her to know what to do with the baby or something and she said like, “Why</br>   you left me? So what you going to tell me about it?” And I say, “Karen</br>   you're 22 you need to understand.” And she is like, “No, you never, [pause]</br>   why'd you sign it for you to leave?” I mean she's very upset with me too, I</br>   don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't win. You said that one of your children, your daughter, had</br>   a heart murmur.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have health insurance? How did you pay for the medical</br>   procedures?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I had regular medical, like everybody and I pay like $10 a month and</br>   they give me the best doctors. And when my son...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was that through the government?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And my son too, he have a major surgery because when he born</br>   his penis was inside.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So his urine conduct was stuck. So they needed a major surgery and I</br>   didn't pay anything. I paid with my medical and they sent me to the best</br>   doctors and he's okay. So for me, that's why I'm so grateful for USA, I</br>   love USA. So when this happened I was like, “Why?” I mean, I understand</br>   that not all the people that was to go to USA is going to be able because</br>   everyone wants to go over there. But I mean if we are working, we are</br>   paying taxes—they don't give taxes back. Just if you have kids, they give</br>   you $1,000 a year or something, but they don't give you more. And you still</br>   paying taxes. I mean the people we are without, even driving ticket or</br>   anything why they don't let us stay? Or like this family, they took my life</br>   away without knowing what they doing. It was easy for them to call</br>   immigration without thinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When they made claims about, well obviously you were undocumented,</br>   but they made claims also that you had engaged in a criminal acts as well?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They needed to call the police first. They can call the immigration</br>   first. So they called the local police and they say that I was robbing his</br>   home. And they have a fingerprints and I was like, “Yeah, sure. I was over</br>   there for four years or more.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh you lived with him?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you dated him. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I dated him. Yeah. So I mean the police man just told me you know</br>   that is not true. But they did their report because they want immigration</br>   to come to pick you up. They want you out of this. And they just did it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And even though the police did not really agree or think it was a</br>   valid claim, they had no—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Ice, Treatment by">Rocio: They say I need to follow the report. And even the immigration guy,   he stopped in the middle of the road and he told me, “Who did this to you?”   I mean I told him my kids, my apartment, my car—because the police were   arriving and I was in a towel because I was in the shower and they don't   let me dress, so he took me to the police car and we wait for an hour. I   was in my towel and then immigration guy arrived and he told me, “What are   you doing almost naked here?” And I said, “Well he don't even let me get   pants or something.” So he let me get in my house, get dressed and he told   me, get your papers, your birth certificate for your kids and everything   you think you're going to need.    </span> Rocio: So I was lucky that he went with me in my home and then just start</br>   driving and he parked and he say, “Who did this to you?” And I was like,</br>   “Please let me go!” And he said, “I can't, I have the report and I need to</br>   arrive with you. But what you did or what is it?” I have my kids, I work, I</br>   paid taxes. He said “Sorry, I just can't let you go.” So they took me out</br>   [pause].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you left voluntarily, I mean it's not really voluntary, but you</br>   signed the papers and you left and they deported you? Was there an option</br>   to fight it?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I call, they tell me to call here to Relaciones exteriors (Mexican</br>   Consulate), to the government here. And I did call and they told me, “You</br>   just sign. Because if they take you to the judge and the judge deport you,</br>   you never going to come back.” So in the moment I was like, of course in</br>   shock, I was thinking about my kids. I was like what I need to do to don't</br>   have more problems. Just sign, you need to sign, you don't go to the judge</br>   because they going to deport you or they going to take your kids away and</br>   blah, blah, blah. So I just signed.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I'm so sorry. So sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, it's hard. I mean, I know my kids is thanks to my family and</br>   the people around me. It's been not crazy like other peoples, other people</br>   it's terrible. Anyway, if you have family, they destroyed your family. Even</br>   though I get back to my kids one day is not to be the same never.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They're American citizens. There's no reason that the U.S Government</br>   should be destroying their lives.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Worst parts">Rocio: Yeah. They are destroying an American citizen because they are   suffering. And it's just not fair. But I'm very glad that people like you   are doing this because what I want is to be able to talk to more people, to   know what this is about. And it's just not because I went to United States   because I don't like Mexico or I come back and going to steal jobs because   I speak English because it's not that way. And the way we can help the   people that go through these situations and go to the government and ask   them—I'm here for nine years and I can't get a job and I'm 55 or I need to   support myself. I need to support my kids. I need to live. I'm Mexican and   I am not able to do nothing if you're in my country and it's terrible. And   that's what I'm going to fight for now. Because if not, I don't know if I'm   going to survive or what am I going to do. My family is not going to be   there forever.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in the US">Rocio: Yes, it's hard. I mean, I know my kids is thanks to my family and   the people around me. It's been not crazy like other peoples, other people   it's terrible. Anyway, if you have family, they destroyed your family. Even   though I get back to my kids one day is not to be the same never.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Detention, Court Proceedings">Rocio: I call, they tell me to call here to Relaciones exteriors (Mexican   Consulate), to the government here.

Just sign, you need to sign, you don't go to the judge   because they going to deport you or they going to take your kids away and   blah, blah, blah. So I just signed.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Arrests">Rocio: So I was lucky that he went with me in my home and then just start   driving and he parked and he say, “Who did this to you?” And I was like,   “Please let me go!” And he said, “I can't, I have the report and I need to   arrive with you. But what you did or what is it?” I have my kids, I work, I   paid taxes.

She all the time… I tried to tell   her to know what to do with the baby or something and she said like, “Why   you left me? So what you going to tell me about it?” And I say, “Karen   you're 22 you need to understand.” And she is like, “No, you never, [pause]   why'd you sign it for you to leave?” I mean she's very upset with me too, I   don't know.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Friends">Rocio: Yes. Emotional problems. I, of course, keep in touch with my friend   and she's like, well this week he was in a fight at school. He eats when he   is upset or nervous. Sometimes for a month or two he's okay and they talk   to him a lot. She's like his behavior at school sometimes is—I don't know   because he have dark hair. Or I told her you ought to be careful with   bullying, maybe it's that and she's not that very involved with him at   school and everything. But sometimes, like right now, it's getting better.   But when he's nervous …he gets in middle school already and he told my   friend I'm very afraid to go to school. So he begins to eat and eat and   right now he is very big. But we talked to him a lot so I don't know what's   going to happen. It’s still problems with—    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in the US">Rocio: And gives me the opportunity to have the best doctors for my kids   and that you have schools that you don't need pay much. When that happened   to me, I thought to bring my daughter and I don't know, going to be able to   pay your school and I'm not going to put her in a public school here   because the difference is going to be too much for her. So I decided to   leave her over there. So everything, I like everything.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Cultural differences, Crime and Violence">re in Mexico is just crazy. When I used to drive, everybody was   telling me what are you doing? Do you need to stop? You need to drive   carefully. And I just get it immediately. I liked that respect for others.   I just click with everything. I just love it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Living situation">Rocio: Oh. Everything. I mean for me it was a very good time. I had very   good jobs. I have time to be with my kids a lot because I worked nine to   four, so I have all afternoon with my kids. I was able go to the beach. As   you know, Palm Springs is very close to the beach, the snow, and mountains.   So I love the USA. I just love that place. So I hope—I mean it's not going   to be the same of course, but it's different. I just always love to be   there.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Children">Rocio: And my friend wants to adopt my kid and I'm not ready to do that   either. I'm not going to take my son away from her because she's been so   nice, but I'm not going to sign that you know [laughs]? So I mean, it's   just a nightmare for everybody. It's just not right. We don't go to steal   nobody's jobs. We go to have a better life. That's it. And we are very   hardworking people. So I don't know what's going to happen.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, DACA">Rocio: So I'm just starting to get more strength to help people because you   know, hearing the stories and everything—my stories all the time here in my   mind. I'm starting to like it because I love to help people you know? And I   start when the situation with the DACA start in United States, I was like,   “This is not fair, this can't be happening.” I have thousands of friends in   United States that took their kids very young, one, two years old. And the   future was going to be for them, you know? And if they took the kids, the   parent stay or if they took the parent back, what would the kids going to   do in the United States? My kids were so lucky to have my daughter, her   father, and my son, my friend. But even though that's illegal because they   just have a paper, we haven't been able to do nothing really legal because   it's too expensive.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Illness, Time in the US, Immigration status, Lack of mental health resources">Rocio: And for everybody in my family needs to help me. I feel like I'm 15   years old because they pay my rent. So it's just everything is—I tried to   kill myself two years ago when I broke my back and they told me I need to   be in bed for a year because I can't have surgery. So it was like, I can't   do this anymore. You know, it's just, I can't, but it wasn't my time. I   hurt myself in every way you can imagine. And at night, it was time. I   didn't do it. I can't do it. So I started going to the psychiatrist again,   and everything is money, so it's just, I don't know when this is going to   end you know?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in the US">Rocio: She's in North of Mexico, Sonora. She crossed the border and   everything and the baby born in USA, praise God. But she's helping him and   I can't see her because I don't have the money to bring her. Do you know   the flights and everything? I mean, I have very much contact with her and   with my boy. With him I talk—of course he don't have Facebook or   anything—every 15 days and with my daughter every time she's on Facebook we   talk. But she have a baby and I haven't meet him. He's going to be already   two years old. So I don't know, it's just a nightmare.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work">Rocio: I mean you get in internet to get a job and it's just until you're   35 years old. So what would you want to do here? I mean, I speak enough   English to work in an office and they tell me no because my age. So it's   been hard all this time, even though my friend said, “Well you have already   nine years here.” I said, “For me it's been like nine hours.” I mean it's   been very difficult and go through everything. My kids is the worst part.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work, Time in the US, Illness">And because my age. I just been working—in   nine years, I just got three jobs. And last year I broke a bone in my back.   So I stay a year in bed. After that, I'd been looking for a job for a year   and I'm not able to get a job because my age, so it's just a nightmare. And   so I've been trying to get more involved in these situations, to see if we   can get together, the people that we go through this and help each other   because it's just crazy.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US,  DAVA">Rocio: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers. They took all my money,   thousand dollars every time. Everybody telling me they going to help me to   go back. And of course until I say okay, no more paying to lawyers or   anything. And I met Yolanda Verona, the one who wants to create more   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in   Mexico.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Crime and Violence">Rocio: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers.

And I met Yolanda Verona, the one who wants to create more   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in   Mexico. And I said, “Okay, but I just opened a Facebook page and everybody   are in United States.” So, I was like, “No, I need to meet people here.”   But in Mexico, I haven't met anybody, just one, Ana Laura Lopez, and she's   helping a lot people that came here—she waits for them in the airport and   help them if they don't have place to stay or a job, or anything. But she   lives so far from me, so we met once but we can't even talk, you know to do   something together yet.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Lack of mental health resources">Rocio: Of course, everything is a disaster. I was two years in bed with   depression. My first two years, I just don't want to live. So, thanks to my   family, help me and said, “Your kids needs you. You can't just die in bed.”  </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Rocio: And my daughter was 13 and of course she was in middle school and I   told her, “No, you need to stay over there and finish your school. You have   your dad.” Of course, after three or four years, she began to not behave,   you know, and she didn't finish high school. She just finished second. She   just left one year, but she didn't finish and she started having problems   with behavior, living with friends, and I didn't know anything. Her dad   can't control her. So it was very hard for me. Very, very hard for me. Even   though my son started peeing the bed for two or three years, my friend   needs to take him to a psychologist. Saturday he turns 12, but he's 12   years old. We talked with him and try to explain to him, but he really   don't understand why I cannot cross the border. Why he cannot come over   here because it's hard for him to cross without me. And of course he's   still having problems sometimes with behavior or gain weight or lose weight   or depression.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in the US">Rocio: So that's when I need to make that decision to let him go, with my   friend. She's everything to me. Of course, she's very, very—a great family.   She just have a son. So, she signed it like a tutor [inquisitive] to keep   him until I was able to come back. Because at the beginning I was fighting   to go back and talking with everybody, but they told me, you have 10 years   and you need to stay over there. So it was extremely hard for me to make   that decision, but it's not for me. It's his life. He has everything over   there. And I'm not going to take that away from him.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Rocio: He was three years old, almost three. And he don't speak Spanish or   they don't let me, they just don't take him. So, it was like two months   after I bring him, that my friend called me and told me, “We need to think,   he have everything here, you know, he's an American citizen. What are you   going to do over there with him? You don't have a place. You live with your   mom.”    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Rocio: Yes. Yes. My daughter speaks English because I teach her at the   beginning. And at school, she started speaking English. My son never want   to speak Spanish. Since I start talking to him in Spanish and he never   wanted it. So when I bring him, after a year that I came here, I took him,   I tried to keep him with me, but it was hard because I get a job. So very   early in the morning, I take him with my aunt and I pick him up at night in   pajamas already. So it was crazy for me.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Being secretive">Rocio: And that's when I started having problems because I didn't change   the visa and so I lost my license, even though I was able to buy cars, to   rent apartments and I never have a problem with that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work, Documents, Driver’s license">Rocio: Yes, I had a good one. But after 10 years here in Mexico, they   changed the visa for 10 years. Every 10 years you need to change it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status">Rocio: Dating, they just call immigration and my nightmare starts and my   life just was over, because I lost everything. Thank God my kids weren't   with me that day. My daughter was with her dad and my son was with a friend   of mine. So they took me just by myself. But that's when everything   started. I didn't come to Mexico for 18 years. So it was just a nightmare.   That's when everything started.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Rocio: After 13 years, I have another kid, Chris, my son. I didn't get   married, I have been by myself. And then I start working for these   people—the last persons that I worked for. And my boss brings a friend from   Michigan, and we start dating since the beginning. And his family, he just   told me they don't like Mexicans. So after four years—    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work">Because Palm Springs is in   summer it's so hot, they go away for three, four months.

Thank God my kids weren't</br>   with me that day. My daughter was with her dad and my son was with a friend</br>   of mine. So they took me just by myself. But that's when everything</br>   started. I didn't come to Mexico for 18 years.

He never answered me again or anything. So I</br>   don't know if he had something to do with it or not or I don't know. I</br>   don't even want to because, I mean if I was by myself, okay. But it was my</br>   family [emphasis].

But after 10 years here in Mexico, they</br>   changed the visa for 10 years. Every 10 years you need to change it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And that's when I started having problems because I didn't change</br>   the visa and so I lost my license, even though I was able to buy cars, to</br>   rent apartments and I never have a problem with that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you get credit cards and—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No credit card. No, it's just a bank account, but not credit cards.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your children grew up as Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. Yes. My daughter speaks English because I teach her at the</br>   beginning. And at school, she started speaking English. My son never want</br>   to speak Spanish. Since I start talking to him in Spanish and he never</br>   wanted it. So when I bring him, after a year that I came here, I took him,</br>   I tried to keep him with me, but it was hard because I get a job. So very</br>   early in the morning, I take him with my aunt and I pick him up at night in</br>   pajamas already. So it was crazy for me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Here in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Here in Mexico. I took him to schools to see if I can register him.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And he was how old?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: He was three years old, almost three. And he don't speak Spanish or</br>   they don't let me, they just don't take him. So, it was like two months</br>   after I bring him, that my friend called me and told me, “We need to think,</br>   he have everything here, you know, he's an American citizen. What are you</br>   going to do over there with him? You don't have a place. You live with your</br>   mom.”</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So that's when I need to make that decision to let him go, with my</br>   friend. She's everything to me. Of course, she's very, very—a great family.</br>   She just have a son. So, she signed it like a tutor [inquisitive] to keep</br>   him until I was able to come back. Because at the beginning I was fighting</br>   to go back and talking with everybody, but they told me, you have 10 years</br>   and you need to stay over there. So it was extremely hard for me to make</br>   that decision, but it's not for me. It's his life. He has everything over</br>   there. And I'm not going to take that away from him.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my daughter was 13 and of course she was in middle school and I</br>   told her, “No, you need to stay over there and finish your school. You have</br>   your dad.” Of course, after three or four years, she began to not behave,</br>   you know, and she didn't finish high school. She just finished second. She</br>   just left one year, but she didn't finish and she started having problems</br>   with behavior, living with friends, and I didn't know anything. Her dad</br>   can't control her. So it was very hard for me. Very, very hard for me. Even</br>   though my son started peeing the bed for two or three years, my friend</br>   needs to take him to a psychologist. Saturday he turns 12, but he's 12</br>   years old. We talked with him and try to explain to him, but he really</br>   don't understand why I cannot cross the border. Why he cannot come over</br>   here because it's hard for him to cross without me. And of course he's</br>   still having problems sometimes with behavior or gain weight or lose weight</br>   or depression.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Of course, everything is a disaster. I was two years in bed with</br>   depression. My first two years, I just don't want to live. So, thanks to my</br>   family, help me and said, “Your kids needs you. You can't just die in bed.”</br>   So I went to see psychiatrist, and they give me medication and I stayed on</br>   medication. And so, after I don't know, like five years or six years of</br>   being here, I start like, “Okay, I need to get involved in this, what I can</br>   do to help people and help myself.” You know? Just start doing what I'm</br>   going to do, it's six years already.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers. They took all my money,</br>   thousand dollars every time. Everybody telling me they going to help me to</br>   go back. And of course until I say okay, no more paying to lawyers or</br>   anything. And I met Yolanda Verona, the one who wants to create more</br>   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in</br>   Mexico. And I said, “Okay, but I just opened a Facebook page and everybody</br>   are in United States.” So, I was like, “No, I need to meet people here.”</br>   But in Mexico, I haven't met anybody, just one, Ana Laura Lopez, and she's</br>   helping a lot people that came here—she waits for them in the airport and</br>   help them if they don't have place to stay or a job, or anything. But she</br>   lives so far from me, so we met once but we can't even talk, you know to do</br>   something together yet.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they're called DREAMer moms?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: DREAMers moms.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does she know Israel here in New Comienzos?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I think yes, I think yes. I think Israel told me that they need to</br>   meet her, but I don't know if they did already. And they introduced me to</br>   Gretchen—I don't know the last name. The movie director. Do you know it?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They introduced me to her and she's working in Relaciones exteriores</br>   here in the government. So she told me once that I need to contact her</br>   because I'm going to be already 10 years here and she can help me to start</br>   to see what I can have. If I can have a visa to go just for visit or if my</br>   daughter can ask for me because she's 22 already. Or start something to do,</br>   what I’m going to do… and to get my son's passport.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he can visit you?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So he can come visit me. And the situation here that has been so</br>   difficult for me. That is just unbelievable that even in the United States</br>   without papers, I was able to get my car, to rent apartments and here in</br>   Mexico I can't. They asked me for a lot of papers and it's just the doors</br>   close for me here all the time. And because my age. I just been working—in</br>   nine years, I just got three jobs. And last year I broke a bone in my back.</br>   So I stay a year in bed. After that, I'd been looking for a job for a year</br>   and I'm not able to get a job because my age, so it's just a nightmare. And</br>   so I've been trying to get more involved in these situations, to see if we</br>   can get together, the people that we go through this and help each other</br>   because it's just crazy.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I mean you get in internet to get a job and it's just until you're</br>   35 years old. So what would you want to do here? I mean, I speak enough</br>   English to work in an office and they tell me no because my age. So it's</br>   been hard all this time, even though my friend said, “Well you have already</br>   nine years here.” I said, “For me it's been like nine hours.” I mean it's</br>   been very difficult and go through everything. My kids is the worst part.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And is your daughter, does she still live in Palm Springs?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: She live in Palm Springs. She get a Mexican boyfriend and he don't</br>   have papers. So, she's helping him to get papers to go with her to the</br>   United States because she got—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is she back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: She's in North of Mexico, Sonora. She crossed the border and</br>   everything and the baby born in USA, praise God. But she's helping him and</br>   I can't see her because I don't have the money to bring her. Do you know</br>   the flights and everything? I mean, I have very much contact with her and</br>   with my boy. With him I talk—of course he don't have Facebook or</br>   anything—every 15 days and with my daughter every time she's on Facebook we</br>   talk. But she have a baby and I haven't meet him. He's going to be already</br>   two years old. So I don't know, it's just a nightmare.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like a nightmare?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And for everybody in my family needs to help me. I feel like I'm 15</br>   years old because they pay my rent. So it's just everything is—I tried to</br>   kill myself two years ago when I broke my back and they told me I need to</br>   be in bed for a year because I can't have surgery. So it was like, I can't</br>   do this anymore. You know, it's just, I can't, but it wasn't my time. I</br>   hurt myself in every way you can imagine. And at night, it was time. I</br>   didn't do it. I can't do it. So I started going to the psychiatrist again,</br>   and everything is money, so it's just, I don't know when this is going to</br>   end you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well hopefully, at least when the 10 years are up, you'll be able to</br>   find some way. It's temporary.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yeah, I hope so. I hope so too. I don't even know, just do think if</br>   I can go back and stay or I just want to for the moment, I just want to go</br>   and be able to cross the border to see my kid every time I'm able to. And</br>   of course I want to stay because the situation here with the jobs is just</br>   crazy and I just can't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You have such good English, it's really too bad—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes!</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That people don't take advantage of that.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So I'm just starting to get more strength to help people because you</br>   know, hearing the stories and everything—my stories all the time here in my</br>   mind. I'm starting to like it because I love to help people you know? And I</br>   start when the situation with the DACA start in United States, I was like,</br>   “This is not fair, this can't be happening.” I have thousands of friends in</br>   United States that took their kids very young, one, two years old. And the</br>   future was going to be for them, you know? And if they took the kids, the</br>   parent stay or if they took the parent back, what would the kids going to</br>   do in the United States? My kids were so lucky to have my daughter, her</br>   father, and my son, my friend. But even though that's illegal because they</br>   just have a paper, we haven't been able to do nothing really legal because</br>   it's too expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my friend wants to adopt my kid and I'm not ready to do that</br>   either. I'm not going to take my son away from her because she's been so</br>   nice, but I'm not going to sign that you know [laughs]? So I mean, it's</br>   just a nightmare for everybody. It's just not right. We don't go to steal</br>   nobody's jobs. We go to have a better life. That's it. And we are very</br>   hardworking people. So I don't know what's going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you think back about your time, what were your favorite things</br>   about the U.S?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Oh. Everything. I mean for me it was a very good time. I had very</br>   good jobs. I have time to be with my kids a lot because I worked nine to</br>   four, so I have all afternoon with my kids. I was able go to the beach. As</br>   you know, Palm Springs is very close to the beach, the snow, and mountains.</br>   So I love the USA. I just love that place. So I hope—I mean it's not going</br>   to be the same of course, but it's different. I just always love to be</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think living there changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. In a good way. Very good way. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me how.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: You know I was more involved with the community. Here? Never—just my</br>   friends said that's it. Over there they teach me how to be involved with</br>   the community. Like with the police community when they did in the park,</br>   events. And I always were there. Here, Mexico, it's not like that. And I</br>   like that a lot. And respect for the community, the way we drive over</br>   there. Here in Mexico is just crazy. When I used to drive, everybody was</br>   telling me what are you doing? Do you need to stop? You need to drive</br>   carefully. And I just get it immediately. I liked that respect for others.</br>   I just click with everything. I just love it.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And gives me the opportunity to have the best doctors for my kids</br>   and that you have schools that you don't need pay much. When that happened</br>   to me, I thought to bring my daughter and I don't know, going to be able to</br>   pay your school and I'm not going to put her in a public school here</br>   because the difference is going to be too much for her. So I decided to</br>   leave her over there. So everything, I like everything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said your son has been having difficulties, emotional</br>   problems?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. Emotional problems. I, of course, keep in touch with my friend</br>   and she's like, well this week he was in a fight at school. He eats when he</br>   is upset or nervous. Sometimes for a month or two he's okay and they talk</br>   to him a lot. She's like his behavior at school sometimes is—I don't know</br>   because he have dark hair. Or I told her you ought to be careful with</br>   bullying, maybe it's that and she's not that very involved with him at</br>   school and everything. But sometimes, like right now, it's getting better.</br>   But when he's nervous …he gets in middle school already and he told my</br>   friend I'm very afraid to go to school. So he begins to eat and eat and</br>   right now he is very big. But we talked to him a lot so I don't know what's</br>   going to happen. It’s still problems with—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: And my daughter never forgive me. She all the time… I tried to tell</br>   her to know what to do with the baby or something and she said like, “Why</br>   you left me? So what you going to tell me about it?” And I say, “Karen</br>   you're 22 you need to understand.” And she is like, “No, you never, [pause]</br>   why'd you sign it for you to leave?” I mean she's very upset with me too, I</br>   don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't win. You said that one of your children, your daughter, had</br>   a heart murmur.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have health insurance? How did you pay for the medical</br>   procedures?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I had regular medical, like everybody and I pay like $10 a month and</br>   they give me the best doctors. And when my son...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was that through the government?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And my son too, he have a major surgery because when he born</br>   his penis was inside.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So his urine conduct was stuck. So they needed a major surgery and I</br>   didn't pay anything. I paid with my medical and they sent me to the best</br>   doctors and he's okay. So for me, that's why I'm so grateful for USA, I</br>   love USA. So when this happened I was like, “Why?” I mean, I understand</br>   that not all the people that was to go to USA is going to be able because</br>   everyone wants to go over there. But I mean if we are working, we are</br>   paying taxes—they don't give taxes back. Just if you have kids, they give</br>   you $1,000 a year or something, but they don't give you more. And you still</br>   paying taxes. I mean the people we are without, even driving ticket or</br>   anything why they don't let us stay? Or like this family, they took my life</br>   away without knowing what they doing. It was easy for them to call</br>   immigration without thinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When they made claims about, well obviously you were undocumented,</br>   but they made claims also that you had engaged in a criminal acts as well?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They needed to call the police first. They can call the immigration</br>   first. So they called the local police and they say that I was robbing his</br>   home. And they have a fingerprints and I was like, “Yeah, sure. I was over</br>   there for four years or more.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh you lived with him?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you dated him. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I dated him. Yeah. So I mean the police man just told me you know</br>   that is not true. But they did their report because they want immigration</br>   to come to pick you up. They want you out of this. And they just did it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And even though the police did not really agree or think it was a</br>   valid claim, they had no—</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: They say I need to follow the report. And even the immigration guy,</br>   he stopped in the middle of the road and he told me, “Who did this to you?”</br>   I mean I told him my kids, my apartment, my car—because the police were</br>   arriving and I was in a towel because I was in the shower and they don't</br>   let me dress, so he took me to the police car and we wait for an hour. I</br>   was in my towel and then immigration guy arrived and he told me, “What are</br>   you doing almost naked here?” And I said, “Well he don't even let me get</br>   pants or something.” So he let me get in my house, get dressed and he told</br>   me, get your papers, your birth certificate for your kids and everything</br>   you think you're going to need.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So I was lucky that he went with me in my home and then just start</br>   driving and he parked and he say, “Who did this to you?” And I was like,</br>   “Please let me go!” And he said, “I can't, I have the report and I need to</br>   arrive with you. But what you did or what is it?” I have my kids, I work, I</br>   paid taxes. He said “Sorry, I just can't let you go.” So they took me out</br>   [pause].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you left voluntarily, I mean it's not really voluntary, but you</br>   signed the papers and you left and they deported you? Was there an option</br>   to fight it?</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: I call, they tell me to call here to Relaciones exteriors (Mexican</br>   Consulate), to the government here. And I did call and they told me, “You</br>   just sign. Because if they take you to the judge and the judge deport you,</br>   you never going to come back.” So in the moment I was like, of course in</br>   shock, I was thinking about my kids. I was like what I need to do to don't</br>   have more problems. Just sign, you need to sign, you don't go to the judge</br>   because they going to deport you or they going to take your kids away and</br>   blah, blah, blah. So I just signed.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I'm so sorry. So sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes, it's hard. I mean, I know my kids is thanks to my family and</br>   the people around me. It's been not crazy like other peoples, other people</br>   it's terrible. Anyway, if you have family, they destroyed your family. Even</br>   though I get back to my kids one day is not to be the same never.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They're American citizens. There's no reason that the U.S Government</br>   should be destroying their lives.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yeah. They are destroying an American citizen because they are</br>   suffering. And it's just not fair. But I'm very glad that people like you</br>   are doing this because what I want is to be able to talk to more people, to</br>   know what this is about. And it's just not because I went to United States</br>   because I don't like Mexico or I come back and going to steal jobs because</br>   I speak English because it's not that way. And the way we can help the</br>   people that go through these situations and go to the government and ask</br>   them—I'm here for nine years and I can't get a job and I'm 55 or I need to</br>   support myself. I need to support my kids. I need to live. I'm Mexican and</br>   I am not able to do nothing if you're in my country and it's terrible. And</br>   that's what I'm going to fight for now. Because if not, I don't know if I'm</br>   going to survive or what am I going to do. My family is not going to be</br>   there forever.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: So it's hard, difficult. But thank you very much for doing this.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well, thank you so much. And I think you're a very strong person and</br>   I think you're going to, you know, in another year, hopefully you'll see</br>   your family and find some way to reconcile all this in a positive way.</br> </br> </br>   Rocio: Yes. And I think this is going to give me the strength to, if I go</br>   back and fight more and more for these situations. It's terrible. We need</br>   to do something about it.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
