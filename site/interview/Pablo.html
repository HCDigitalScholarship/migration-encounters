I don’t know. What else?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you end up crossing the border or did you get a visa?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I actually used somebody else's papers, somebody else's documents.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Mhm [affirmative].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: So I basically...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: That's how you got over?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. I didn't cross the border or anything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Do you remember your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> moments in the US?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. I remember that this lady, the one that took me over there,</br>   she just told me to go to sleep so I wouldn't have to talk or anything. And</br>   I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; It wasn't hard for me to go to sleep, so I just fell</br>   asleep. And when I woke up, I was over there, everything was so different.</br>   So I was surprised... I don't know. I felt good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What was different?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I mean, you can see everything... It was just… the city was just</br>   more clean, or I don't know, it's just a lot of different stuff. The stores</br>   and buildings and everything was just different.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. A lot of people mentioned the air or the smell, even, was</br>   different.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And where did you end up living when you moved to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I grew up in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>. Before that, when I crossed over there, I</br>   stayed in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Houston</span> for like two months. And then we also went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Florida</span> for</br>   another like two months.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And then <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Houston</span> was where you put in your roots a bit. And what</br>   was it like growing up in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Houston</span>? Did you know you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I did know. I mean, pretty much I grew up in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, sorry, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: At the beginning it was hard, going to school and not speaking</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, everybody making fun of you, and it was hard. But then after a</br>   while you get used to it, and get the hang of it, started making friends</br>   and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you take ESL classes?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What were those like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: They were boring.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: But they were cool because we were all <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> people, so it felt</br>   good, than just being with a bunch of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>. They didn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span></br>   that well, so it was better to be with our ESL team.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. More comfortable probably. Did you like school? Did you like</br>   any particular teachers, or not really for you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Not really. Yeah, I didn't really like school, honestly.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What did you like outside of school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I liked playing soccer, I liked playing soccer, but there's a lot of</br>   stuff going out there that gets your attention, all this partying and</br>   stuff. So yeah, I pretty much got into all that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: How old were you when you got into all that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14</span> when I started hanging out with those friends and-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Were these friends just partying or were they also doing illegal</br>   activities?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, they were actually doing illegal activities, also. I got</br>   involved. I mean, I lived right there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Were these gangs or just casual groups?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. Yeah, some of them. Well actually, a few of my cousins they</br>   were already involved in gangs, so it was pretty easy for me to get used to</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, slip into that lifestyle, I bet.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And that was when you were around <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14 years old</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So did you stop playing soccer then, around there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative). I stopped playing soccer, then I left school</br>   When I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span> I dropped out of school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What grade was that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: That was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">eighth</span> grade, middle school, the last grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did your parents have anything to say about that or were they</br>   not...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: My mom she did not really say anything about that because I actually</br>   told her that I wanted to get a job because I was not doing good in school.</br>   So she was like, &quot;Okay, well, if you're going to do better by having a job,</br>   then just get a job. I'll help you get a job.&quot; Then she basically talked to</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of her friends that she had, and he helped me to get a job. So I</br>   started working when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>. It was at a carpet mill.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What did you do there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: We would get, how do you call them, big rolls of carpet? We would</br>   just have machines to cut them in different sizes and...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Big machines?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Were they dangerous?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, because they're cutting machines and...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did they know you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>? Or did you have to say?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: They didn't know I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span> because I was obviously using a fake ID.</br>   So I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>, but on that fake ID, I would supposedly be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">27</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I mean they knew, but that's just how it is.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you make any friends at work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, I did have a lot of friends at work. Most of them just</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span> people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Around your age, too?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: A few, like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> that were my age. But I think I was the</br>   youngest one.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And this time you were also... Were you in the gang or just</br>   affiliated around it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, I was in the gang.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: In the gang as well?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And what do you think drew you to that? Because one thing my</br>   professor's interested in is the sort of factors that draw or bring kids</br>   into gangs and that kind of activity, away from school and stuff, what the</br>   trends are. What was it in your case?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques</br>   that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say?</br>   Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that</br>   you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So would you say it was a pride thing or more protection?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, it's a pride thing. It's a pride thing. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, especially if you had family members who were already in it.</br>   That's on top of being sort of like brothers through that. You're also</br>   already by blood, as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. So you were working and also doing this when you weren't</br>   working. So you were doing both simultaneously?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: When I started working, I didn't get to hang around with them that</br>   much, that’s when I didn't used to work, that’s when I was in school. But</br>   there was times, for example, on the weekends and everything, every weekend</br>   there would be someone there to pick me up and &quot;You know what? Let's go do</br>   this and that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What was this and that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we</br>   would go to the bars, we would go to the parks. And if you see a rival</br>   gang, then we would just... Like we say, hit them up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Hit them up. Is that just start a fight?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. Basically, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And that was from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15 years old</span> to...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: To like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17, 18</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: To <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17</span>. And then what happened when you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Well, I kind of came down a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Why was that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I got with a girl. She came to live with me. I dedicated more time</br>   to her. She didn't really let me go out that much because she knew what I</br>   was doing. Basically, it was for her that I came down.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you have a child with her or anything?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: No. Well she got pregnant one time, something went wrong, and she</br>   lost it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Like a miscarriage?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. She had a miscarriage.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you want the baby?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, no I did want the baby. Yeah. It was messed up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: I'm sorry. I know, that's difficult.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So then how old were you when you left the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, or how did you leave</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">22</span>. I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">22. 21</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">22</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What led to you leaving the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Well, I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What were the events leading up to deportation? What caused it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I was driving without a license.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Driving without a license. And did they have any other record of</br>   you because of your affiliation when you were younger with gangs, or...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, gang-related.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So this was your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> infraction or whatever you want to call it,</br>   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you</br>   treated? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I was taken in by the police and then the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> officer would come</br>   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal</br>   people, make you sign your deportation.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with</br>   any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You're going to sign this so you</br>   can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,</br>   also. I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17</span> by then.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Why were you arrested that time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually</br>   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took</br>   me to jail.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were</br>   taken to jail at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">17</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Okay. So then they had you in the system beforehand?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And then when you were arrested for driving without a license, they</br>   looked that up. You weren't given the chance to fight your case or</br>   anything?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yes, I was, but I didn't want to.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Why was that? Just didn't want to spend that much time in</br>   detention or anything?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. Yeah, because I would see a lot of people that they'd be</br>   fighting their case and they would be in jail for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span>. And then after</br>   that, they'd still get deported. So might as well just deport me right</br>   away. I don't want to spend a lot of time just here, so that at the end you</br>   can just go and deport me anyways.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Right. Were you still like with your girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: With what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, sorry, you didn't have a child. I'm sorry. [inaudible 00:12:22]</br>   sensitive. So you were still with your girlfriend at the time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And then, soon you're deported. Was that difficult to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, it was. She used to tell me that she wanted to come down here</br>   with me, but I was like... I was struggling over here, and it was not easy.</br>   So, I told her, &quot;You know what? I don't think it's a good idea. Because</br>   things are different, and you're not going to like it, and I don't want to</br>   tell you, 'Yes, come on over here and we're going to be fine.' And then</br>   what if you don't like it and then you get mad and you're going to be like,</br>   'It's your fault I came over here.'&quot; I didn't want none of that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: It's a big risk.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Was she also undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, so if she came, she would have to probably stay as well.</br>   Could you tell me about, you said it was difficult reintegrating. Can you</br>   tell me a bit about your deportation? How you were deported and then what</br>   it was like being in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, because again, it's almost like a new country.</br>   You spent so much time in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. Just how is reintegrating into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   society?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. Well, it is kind of difficult, because it was hard for me to</br>   get a job at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, because I didn't have any documents or any papers or</br>   anything. And my parents wouldn't help me, either because I was... I used</br>   to dress weird.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Weird?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. They always tell me I got a mean face. I don't know why, but</br>   everybody always tells me that. And since I used to dress baggy, they would</br>   look at me like…</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Oh, thinking that you were becoming dangerous or something, or</br>   untrustworthy?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Because we've talked to a lot of people who have had similar</br>   experiences, were affiliated or part of gangs in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> and then were like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I want a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> chance. I want to get the job here, do different</br>   things.&quot; And then maybe because of their tattoos and the way they present</br>   themselves, are then stereotyped as that way here, as well. So that was a</br>   bit of your experience?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So when you were reintegrating back, was it difficult? What were</br>   some of the biggest challenges finding a job, being separated from your</br>   girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Well, being separated from my mom, because actually I was over there</br>   with my mom and my mom's still over there. She's still living over there in</br>   Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And you're close with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah. We talk a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Do you talk a lot now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: By the phone, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Does she check in with you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What do you talk about? Just anything?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, just how she's doing, how I'm doing, how things are over here,</br>   how things are over there. Kids over there, my little brothers and sisters.</br>   How they’re doing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So pretty much your whole family is back in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And how long have you been back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Six years</span> now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Six years</span>. Do you feel like it's gotten easier since you <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> came</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: What's gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Well, I got a better job now and that's basically... I live on my</br>   own now, I can pay my own things. Then when I got here, I had to be moving</br>   around with my aunts and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: With your family members.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: With my family members, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So you had a bit of a support system, or... A little bit?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Did you get any help from any other organizations or anything?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Do you feel like you were treated differently here because you</br>   lived in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> for some time? Or do you feel different than other people</br>   here? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: No. I don't feel different. I'm from here you know. I mean what gets</br>   me kind of upset is like you know, like I've seen people around here, some</br>   guys that I work with, they grew up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, and when they come here,</br>   they be like, &quot;Hey, where you from?&quot; They try to bring like the stuff from</br>   over there, over here. For example, I had some guys the other day come up</br>   to me and they're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; Because they come with the... How</br>   can I say it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: When you're in a gang in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, you come up to see another gang</br>   member, you're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; And then you start all that stuff,</br>   you know. That upsets me kind of because we're in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, and we're</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>. I seen some people here, they'll be like, &quot;Ah, Well, I'm from</br>   Chicago, or I'm from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span> or...&quot; Like that. I'm going to be like, “well then</br>   why are you here if you were from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span> or if you were from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">LA</span>? Or</br>   whatever you say you're from, you wouldn't be here, you know” I don't like</br>   saying that, because like I said, I do see people here that be like that.</br>   &quot;Well, I come from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Chicago</span> or I come from...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Okay, you come from over there, you grew up over there. But I mean,</br>   you're not even from over there. You're from here. I mean, that's something</br>   that just I don't...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: So do you feel like you're more in touch with your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> roots or</br>   identity here than some other people you know coming in?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah, yeah. I mean, if somebody comes up to me and be like, &quot;Where</br>   you from?&quot; I'm not going to be like, &quot;Well I'm from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>.&quot; No, I'm from</br>   here. I was born here. I lived over there, but that's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Some people will say like, &quot;Oh, well, you're either like too</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or too <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>.&quot; What's your response</br>   to that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I don't think I have a response to that. I'm just <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, that's</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: That's who I am.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: If you were in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> still, what do you think you'd be doing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Working.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Working. Do you know what job you'd want?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Well, you don't really have an option over there. You still illegal,</br>   so you got pretty much got to adapt to whatever there is. I don't mind. As</br>   long as I'm working, as long as I have a job, it don't really matter.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Nice. And what are your plans for, now that you're in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>? What</br>   do you hope to do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: I just want to keep working. I don't know. Just in the future, maybe</br>   get a house, have my Mom come over here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah. Be with your mother. Nice. Well, is there anything else you'd</br>   want people to know or experiences you should share?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: No, I think that's about it. It is pretty hard. And once you get</br>   deported, especially when you get deported, when you come by your own</br>   decision, you know, you're good. But when you get deported and you just get</br>   arrested with no money in your pocket and then they let you out like that.</br>   And it is pretty hard because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is dangerous. There's a lot of things</br>   that can happen to you and stuff. I'm glad I made it. I'm glad I'm here</br>   now. I'm glad I got a job. I'm not into that much trouble anymore. I have</br>   my kid.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: And now you have a child here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: How old is your kid here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: He's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">Two</span>. Are there any values or things that you feel like you want</br>   your kid to have, or what do you hope?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Yes, I do want my kid to- I want him to in the future, grow up,</br>   study as much as he can, get a career, be someone not like me. I want him</br>   to --That's why I only want one, so I can give him everything. I don't want</br>   any more kids. I mean, I'm not going to be able to give him everything.</br>   Might as well just keep one and give him all that I can.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you'd ever want your kid to go to</br>   the US and visit your family?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: Of course, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Do any education in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, do everything here, or...?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: No. I mean, I think he can do it here. I don't think there's no need</br>   for you to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. You can be someone here. You can study here, you can</br>   make a career.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Pablo</span>: You don't necessarily need to go somewhere else. In the future, you</br>   never know if there would be an opportunity. I'm not going to stop him</br>   from... I don't know. There's a chance that in the future he decides that</br>   he wants to go over somewhere else or he wants... It just depends on him.</br>   I'm just going to support him through whatever he wants to do. As long as</br>   it's something good, I'm always going to just be there and support him.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Isabel</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Economic">Isabel: Can you tell me a bit about how old you were when you migrated,   what the reasons were?     Pablo: I was five years old, and the reason was because my Dad died when I   was five, so my Mom decided to go to the States and work for a better life.    </span> Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: So, I think that's why. I don’t know. What else?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you end up crossing the border or did you get a visa?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I actually used somebody else's papers, somebody else's documents.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Mhm [affirmative].</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: So I basically...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's how you got over?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. I didn't cross the border or anything.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you remember your first moments in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. I remember that this lady, the one that took me over there,</br>   she just told me to go to sleep so I wouldn't have to talk or anything. And</br>   I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; It wasn't hard for me to go to sleep, so I just fell</br>   asleep. And when I woke up, I was over there, everything was so different.</br>   So I was surprised... I don't know. I felt good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was different?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I mean, you can see everything... It was just… the city was just</br>   more clean, or I don't know, it's just a lot of different stuff. The stores</br>   and buildings and everything was just different.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. A lot of people mentioned the air or the smell, even, was</br>   different.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And where did you end up living when you moved to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I grew up in Georgia. Before that, when I crossed over there, I</br>   stayed in Houston for like two months. And then we also went to Florida for</br>   another like two months.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then Houston was where you put in your roots a bit. And what</br>   was it like growing up in Houston? Did you know you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I did know. I mean, pretty much I grew up in Georgia...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, sorry, Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: At the beginning it was hard, going to school and not speaking</br>   English, everybody making fun of you, and it was hard. But then after a</br>   while you get used to it, and get the hang of it, started making friends</br>   and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you take ESL classes?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were those like?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: They were boring.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: But they were cool because we were all Hispanic people, so it felt</br>   good, than just being with a bunch of Americans. They didn't speak English</br>   that well, so it was better to be with our ESL team.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. More comfortable probably. Did you like school? Did you like</br>   any particular teachers, or not really for you?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Not really. Yeah, I didn't really like school, honestly.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What did you like outside of school?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I liked playing soccer, I liked playing soccer, but there's a lot of</br>   stuff going out there that gets your attention, all this partying and</br>   stuff. So yeah, I pretty much got into all that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old were you when you got into all that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was 14 when I started hanging out with those friends and-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were these friends just partying or were they also doing illegal</br>   activities?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, they were actually doing illegal activities, also. I got</br>   involved. I mean, I lived right there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Were these gangs or just casual groups?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, some of them. Well actually, a few of my cousins they</br>   were already involved in gangs, so it was pretty easy for me to get used to</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, slip into that lifestyle, I bet.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And that was when you were around 14 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So did you stop playing soccer then, around there?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Mm-hmm (affirmative). I stopped playing soccer, then I left school</br>   When I was 15 I dropped out of school.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What grade was that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: That was in eighth grade, middle school, the last grade.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did your parents have anything to say about that or were they</br>   not...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: My mom she did not really say anything about that because I actually</br>   told her that I wanted to get a job because I was not doing good in school.</br>   So she was like, &quot;Okay, well, if you're going to do better by having a job,</br>   then just get a job. I'll help you get a job.&quot; Then she basically talked to</br>   one of her friends that she had, and he helped me to get a job. So I</br>   started working when I was 15. It was at a carpet mill.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What did you do there?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: We would get, how do you call them, big rolls of carpet? We would</br>   just have machines to cut them in different sizes and...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Big machines?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were they dangerous?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, because they're cutting machines and...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did they know you were 15? Or did you have to say?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: They didn't know I was 15 because I was obviously using a fake ID.</br>   So I was 15, but on that fake ID, I would supposedly be 27.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I mean they knew, but that's just how it is.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you make any friends at work?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I did have a lot of friends at work. Most of them just</br>   Hispanic people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Around your age, too?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: A few, like one or two that were my age. But I think I was the</br>   youngest one.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And this time you were also... Were you in the gang or just</br>   affiliated around it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I was in the gang.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the gang as well?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And what do you think drew you to that? Because one thing my</br>   professor's interested in is the sort of factors that draw or bring kids</br>   into gangs and that kind of activity, away from school and stuff, what the</br>   trends are. What was it in your case?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques</br>   that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say?</br>   Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that</br>   you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So would you say it was a pride thing or more protection?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, it's a pride thing. It's a pride thing. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, especially if you had family members who were already in it.</br>   That's on top of being sort of like brothers through that. You're also</br>   already by blood, as well.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So you were working and also doing this when you weren't</br>   working. So you were doing both simultaneously?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: When I started working, I didn't get to hang around with them that</br>   much, that’s when I didn't used to work, that’s when I was in school. But</br>   there was times, for example, on the weekends and everything, every weekend</br>   there would be someone there to pick me up and &quot;You know what? Let's go do</br>   this and that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was this and that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we</br>   would go to the bars, we would go to the parks. And if you see a rival</br>   gang, then we would just... Like we say, hit them up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Hit them up. Is that just start a fight?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Basically, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And that was from 15 years old to...</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: To like 17, 18.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: To 17. And then what happened when you were 17 or 18?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I kind of came down a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why was that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I got with a girl. She came to live with me. I dedicated more time</br>   to her. She didn't really let me go out that much because she knew what I</br>   was doing. Basically, it was for her that I came down.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have a child with her or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. Well she got pregnant one time, something went wrong, and she</br>   lost it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Like a miscarriage?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. She had a miscarriage.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you want the baby?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, no I did want the baby. Yeah. It was messed up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm sorry. I know, that's difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So then how old were you when you left the US, or how did you leave</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was 22. I was 22. 21 or 22.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What led to you leaving the US? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were the events leading up to deportation? What caused it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was driving without a license.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Driving without a license. And did they have any other record of</br>   you because of your affiliation when you were younger with gangs, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, gang-related.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it,</br>   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you</br>   treated? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come</br>   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal</br>   people, make you sign your deportation.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with</br>   any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You're going to sign this so you</br>   can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,</br>   also. I was 17 by then.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why were you arrested that time?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually</br>   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took</br>   me to jail.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were</br>   taken to jail at 17?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So then they had you in the system beforehand?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Arrest, Deportation, Prison, Challenges">Isabel: And then when you were arrested for driving without a license, they   looked that up. You weren't given the chance to fight your case or   anything?     Pablo: Yes, I was, but I didn't want to.     Isabel: Yeah. Why was that? Just didn't want to spend that much time in   detention or anything?     Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, because I would see a lot of people that they'd be   fighting their case and they would be in jail for a year. And then after   that, they'd still get deported. So might as well just deport me right   away. I don't want to spend a lot of time just here, so that at the end you   can just go and deport me anyways.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Border crossing, Time in the US, First impressions">Pablo: Yeah.

I'm sorry. [inaudible 00:12:22]</br>   sensitive. So you were still with your girlfriend at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then, soon you're deported. Was that difficult to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, it was. She used to tell me that she wanted to come down here</br>   with me, but I was like... I was struggling over here, and it was not easy.</br>   So, I told her, &quot;You know what? I don't think it's a good idea. Because</br>   things are different, and you're not going to like it, and I don't want to</br>   tell you, 'Yes, come on over here and we're going to be fine.' And then</br>   what if you don't like it and then you get mad and you're going to be like,</br>   'It's your fault I came over here.'&quot; I didn't want none of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a big risk.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was she also undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, so if she came, she would have to probably stay as well.</br>   Could you tell me about, you said it was difficult reintegrating. Can you</br>   tell me a bit about your deportation? How you were deported and then what</br>   it was like being in Mexico, because again, it's almost like a new country.</br>   You spent so much time in the US. Just how is reintegrating into Mexican</br>   society?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Well, it is kind of difficult, because it was hard for me to</br>   get a job at first, because I didn't have any documents or any papers or</br>   anything. And my parents wouldn't help me, either because I was... I used</br>   to dress weird.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Weird?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. They always tell me I got a mean face. I don't know why, but</br>   everybody always tells me that. And since I used to dress baggy, they would</br>   look at me like…</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, thinking that you were becoming dangerous or something, or</br>   untrustworthy?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Because we've talked to a lot of people who have had similar</br>   experiences, were affiliated or part of gangs in the US and then were like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I want a second chance. I want to get the job here, do different</br>   things.&quot; And then maybe because of their tattoos and the way they present</br>   themselves, are then stereotyped as that way here, as well. So that was a</br>   bit of your experience?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So when you were reintegrating back, was it difficult? What were</br>   some of the biggest challenges finding a job, being separated from your</br>   girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, being separated from my mom, because actually I was over there</br>   with my mom and my mom's still over there. She's still living over there in</br>   Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And you're close with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. We talk a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you talk a lot now?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: By the phone, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Does she check in with you?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What do you talk about? Just anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, just how she's doing, how I'm doing, how things are over here,</br>   how things are over there. Kids over there, my little brothers and sisters.</br>   How they’re doing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So pretty much your whole family is back in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And how long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Six years now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Six years. Do you feel like it's gotten easier since you first came</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What's gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I got a better job now and that's basically... I live on my</br>   own now, I can pay my own things. Then when I got here, I had to be moving</br>   around with my aunts and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With your family members.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: With my family members, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So you had a bit of a support system, or... A little bit?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you get any help from any other organizations or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you were treated differently here because you</br>   lived in the US for some time? Or do you feel different than other people</br>   here? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. I don't feel different. I'm from here you know. I mean what gets</br>   me kind of upset is like you know, like I've seen people around here, some</br>   guys that I work with, they grew up in the US, and when they come here,</br>   they be like, &quot;Hey, where you from?&quot; They try to bring like the stuff from</br>   over there, over here. For example, I had some guys the other day come up</br>   to me and they're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; Because they come with the... How</br>   can I say it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: When you're in a gang in the US, you come up to see another gang</br>   member, you're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; And then you start all that stuff,</br>   you know. That upsets me kind of because we're in Mexico, and we're</br>   Mexican. I seen some people here, they'll be like, &quot;Ah, Well, I'm from</br>   Chicago, or I'm from LA or...&quot; Like that. I'm going to be like, “well then</br>   why are you here if you were from Chicago or if you were from LA? Or</br>   whatever you say you're from, you wouldn't be here, you know” I don't like</br>   saying that, because like I said, I do see people here that be like that.</br>   &quot;Well, I come from Chicago or I come from...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Okay, you come from over there, you grew up over there. But I mean,</br>   you're not even from over there. You're from here. I mean, that's something</br>   that just I don't...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So do you feel like you're more in touch with your Mexican roots or</br>   identity here than some other people you know coming in?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, yeah. I mean, if somebody comes up to me and be like, &quot;Where</br>   you from?&quot; I'm not going to be like, &quot;Well I'm from Georgia.&quot; No, I'm from</br>   here. I was born here. I lived over there, but that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Some people will say like, &quot;Oh, well, you're either like too</br>   American to be Mexican or too Mexican to be American.&quot; What's your response</br>   to that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I don't think I have a response to that. I'm just Mexican, that's</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's who I am.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: If you were in the US still, what do you think you'd be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Working.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Working. Do you know what job you'd want?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, you don't really have an option over there. You still illegal,</br>   so you got pretty much got to adapt to whatever there is. I don't mind. As</br>   long as I'm working, as long as I have a job, it don't really matter.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. And what are your plans for, now that you're in Mexico? What</br>   do you hope to do?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I just want to keep working. I don't know. Just in the future, maybe</br>   get a house, have my Mom come over here.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Be with your mother. Nice. Well, is there anything else you'd</br>   want people to know or experiences you should share?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, I think that's about it. It is pretty hard. And once you get</br>   deported, especially when you get deported, when you come by your own</br>   decision, you know, you're good. But when you get deported and you just get</br>   arrested with no money in your pocket and then they let you out like that.</br>   And it is pretty hard because Mexico is dangerous. There's a lot of things</br>   that can happen to you and stuff. I'm glad I made it. I'm glad I'm here</br>   now. I'm glad I got a job. I'm not into that much trouble anymore. I have</br>   my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And now you have a child here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old is your kid here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: He's two.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Two. Are there any values or things that you feel like you want</br>   your kid to have, or what do you hope?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes, I do want my kid to- I want him to in the future, grow up,</br>   study as much as he can, get a career, be someone not like me. I want him</br>   to --That's why I only want one, so I can give him everything. I don't want</br>   any more kids. I mean, I'm not going to be able to give him everything.</br>   Might as well just keep one and give him all that I can.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you'd ever want your kid to go to</br>   the US and visit your family?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Of course, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do any education in the US, do everything here, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. I mean, I think he can do it here. I don't think there's no need</br>   for you to go to US. You can be someone here. You can study here, you can</br>   make a career.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Dreams, Children">Pablo: You don't necessarily need to go somewhere else. In the future, you   never know if there would be an opportunity. I'm not going to stop him   from... I don't know. There's a chance that in the future he decides that   he wants to go over somewhere else or he wants... It just depends on him.   I'm just going to support him through whatever he wants to do.

So, I told her, &quot;You know what? I don't think it's a good idea. Because   things are different, and you're not going to like it, and I don't want to   tell you, 'Yes, come on over here and we're going to be fine.' And then   what if you don't like it and then you get mad and you're going to be like,   'It's your fault I came over here.'&quot; I didn't want none of that.     Isabel: It's a big risk.

Isabel: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?     Pablo: No.     Isabel: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it,   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you   treated? What happened?     Pablo: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal   people, make you sign your deportation.     Isabel: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?     Pablo: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with   any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You're going to sign this so you   can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,   also. I was 17 by then.     Isabel: Why were you arrested that time?     Pablo: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took   me to jail.     Isabel: They got like physical, then?

Let's go do   this and that.&quot;     Isabel: What was this and that?     Pablo: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we   would go to the bars, we would go to the parks.

Because one thing my   professor's interested in is the sort of factors that draw or bring kids   into gangs and that kind of activity, away from school and stuff, what the   trends are. What was it in your case?     Pablo: In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques   that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say?   Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that   you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that's it.     Isabel: So would you say it was a pride thing or more protection?     Pablo: Yeah, it's a pride thing. It's a pride thing. Yeah.

I'll help you get a job.&quot; Then she basically talked to   one of her friends that she had, and he helped me to get a job. So I   started working when I was 15. It was at a carpet mill.     Isabel: What did you do there?     Pablo: We would get, how do you call them, big rolls of carpet? We would   just have machines to cut them in different sizes and...     Isabel: Big machines?

Or did you have to say?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: They didn't know I was 15 because I was obviously using a fake ID.</br>   So I was 15, but on that fake ID, I would supposedly be 27.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I mean they knew, but that's just how it is.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you make any friends at work?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I did have a lot of friends at work. Most of them just</br>   Hispanic people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Around your age, too?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: A few, like one or two that were my age. But I think I was the</br>   youngest one.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And this time you were also... Were you in the gang or just</br>   affiliated around it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I was in the gang.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the gang as well?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And what do you think drew you to that? Because one thing my</br>   professor's interested in is the sort of factors that draw or bring kids</br>   into gangs and that kind of activity, away from school and stuff, what the</br>   trends are. What was it in your case?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques</br>   that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say?</br>   Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that</br>   you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So would you say it was a pride thing or more protection?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, it's a pride thing. It's a pride thing. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, especially if you had family members who were already in it.</br>   That's on top of being sort of like brothers through that. You're also</br>   already by blood, as well.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So you were working and also doing this when you weren't</br>   working. So you were doing both simultaneously?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: When I started working, I didn't get to hang around with them that</br>   much, that’s when I didn't used to work, that’s when I was in school. But</br>   there was times, for example, on the weekends and everything, every weekend</br>   there would be someone there to pick me up and &quot;You know what? Let's go do</br>   this and that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was this and that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we</br>   would go to the bars, we would go to the parks. And if you see a rival</br>   gang, then we would just... Like we say, hit them up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Hit them up. Is that just start a fight?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Basically, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And that was from 15 years old to...</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: To like 17, 18.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: To 17. And then what happened when you were 17 or 18?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I kind of came down a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why was that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I got with a girl. She came to live with me. I dedicated more time</br>   to her. She didn't really let me go out that much because she knew what I</br>   was doing. Basically, it was for her that I came down.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have a child with her or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. Well she got pregnant one time, something went wrong, and she</br>   lost it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Like a miscarriage?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. She had a miscarriage.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you want the baby?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, no I did want the baby. Yeah. It was messed up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm sorry. I know, that's difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So then how old were you when you left the US, or how did you leave</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was 22. I was 22. 21 or 22.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What led to you leaving the US? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were the events leading up to deportation? What caused it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was driving without a license.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Driving without a license. And did they have any other record of</br>   you because of your affiliation when you were younger with gangs, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, gang-related.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it,</br>   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you</br>   treated? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come</br>   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal</br>   people, make you sign your deportation.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with</br>   any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You're going to sign this so you</br>   can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,</br>   also. I was 17 by then.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why were you arrested that time?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually</br>   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took</br>   me to jail.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were</br>   taken to jail at 17?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So then they had you in the system beforehand?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then when you were arrested for driving without a license, they</br>   looked that up. You weren't given the chance to fight your case or</br>   anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes, I was, but I didn't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why was that? Just didn't want to spend that much time in</br>   detention or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, because I would see a lot of people that they'd be</br>   fighting their case and they would be in jail for a year. And then after</br>   that, they'd still get deported. So might as well just deport me right</br>   away. I don't want to spend a lot of time just here, so that at the end you</br>   can just go and deport me anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Were you still like with your girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: With what?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, sorry, you didn't have a child. I'm sorry. [inaudible 00:12:22]</br>   sensitive. So you were still with your girlfriend at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then, soon you're deported. Was that difficult to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, it was. She used to tell me that she wanted to come down here</br>   with me, but I was like... I was struggling over here, and it was not easy.</br>   So, I told her, &quot;You know what? I don't think it's a good idea. Because</br>   things are different, and you're not going to like it, and I don't want to</br>   tell you, 'Yes, come on over here and we're going to be fine.' And then</br>   what if you don't like it and then you get mad and you're going to be like,</br>   'It's your fault I came over here.'&quot; I didn't want none of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a big risk.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was she also undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, so if she came, she would have to probably stay as well.</br>   Could you tell me about, you said it was difficult reintegrating. Can you</br>   tell me a bit about your deportation? How you were deported and then what</br>   it was like being in Mexico, because again, it's almost like a new country.</br>   You spent so much time in the US. Just how is reintegrating into Mexican</br>   society?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Well, it is kind of difficult, because it was hard for me to</br>   get a job at first, because I didn't have any documents or any papers or</br>   anything. And my parents wouldn't help me, either because I was... I used</br>   to dress weird.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Weird?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. They always tell me I got a mean face. I don't know why, but</br>   everybody always tells me that. And since I used to dress baggy, they would</br>   look at me like…</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, thinking that you were becoming dangerous or something, or</br>   untrustworthy?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Because we've talked to a lot of people who have had similar</br>   experiences, were affiliated or part of gangs in the US and then were like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I want a second chance. I want to get the job here, do different</br>   things.&quot; And then maybe because of their tattoos and the way they present</br>   themselves, are then stereotyped as that way here, as well. So that was a</br>   bit of your experience?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So when you were reintegrating back, was it difficult? What were</br>   some of the biggest challenges finding a job, being separated from your</br>   girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, being separated from my mom, because actually I was over there</br>   with my mom and my mom's still over there. She's still living over there in</br>   Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And you're close with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. We talk a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you talk a lot now?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: By the phone, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Does she check in with you?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What do you talk about? Just anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, just how she's doing, how I'm doing, how things are over here,</br>   how things are over there. Kids over there, my little brothers and sisters.</br>   How they’re doing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So pretty much your whole family is back in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And how long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Six years now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Six years. Do you feel like it's gotten easier since you first came</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What's gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I got a better job now and that's basically... I live on my</br>   own now, I can pay my own things. Then when I got here, I had to be moving</br>   around with my aunts and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With your family members.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: With my family members, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So you had a bit of a support system, or... A little bit?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you get any help from any other organizations or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you were treated differently here because you</br>   lived in the US for some time? Or do you feel different than other people</br>   here? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. I don't feel different. I'm from here you know. I mean what gets</br>   me kind of upset is like you know, like I've seen people around here, some</br>   guys that I work with, they grew up in the US, and when they come here,</br>   they be like, &quot;Hey, where you from?&quot; They try to bring like the stuff from</br>   over there, over here. For example, I had some guys the other day come up</br>   to me and they're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; Because they come with the... How</br>   can I say it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: When you're in a gang in the US, you come up to see another gang</br>   member, you're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; And then you start all that stuff,</br>   you know. That upsets me kind of because we're in Mexico, and we're</br>   Mexican. I seen some people here, they'll be like, &quot;Ah, Well, I'm from</br>   Chicago, or I'm from LA or...&quot; Like that. I'm going to be like, “well then</br>   why are you here if you were from Chicago or if you were from LA? Or</br>   whatever you say you're from, you wouldn't be here, you know” I don't like</br>   saying that, because like I said, I do see people here that be like that.</br>   &quot;Well, I come from Chicago or I come from...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Okay, you come from over there, you grew up over there. But I mean,</br>   you're not even from over there. You're from here. I mean, that's something</br>   that just I don't...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So do you feel like you're more in touch with your Mexican roots or</br>   identity here than some other people you know coming in?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, yeah. I mean, if somebody comes up to me and be like, &quot;Where</br>   you from?&quot; I'm not going to be like, &quot;Well I'm from Georgia.&quot; No, I'm from</br>   here. I was born here. I lived over there, but that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Some people will say like, &quot;Oh, well, you're either like too</br>   American to be Mexican or too Mexican to be American.&quot; What's your response</br>   to that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I don't think I have a response to that. I'm just Mexican, that's</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's who I am.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: If you were in the US still, what do you think you'd be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Working.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Working. Do you know what job you'd want?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, you don't really have an option over there. You still illegal,</br>   so you got pretty much got to adapt to whatever there is. I don't mind. As</br>   long as I'm working, as long as I have a job, it don't really matter.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. And what are your plans for, now that you're in Mexico? What</br>   do you hope to do?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I just want to keep working. I don't know. Just in the future, maybe</br>   get a house, have my Mom come over here.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Be with your mother. Nice. Well, is there anything else you'd</br>   want people to know or experiences you should share?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, I think that's about it. It is pretty hard. And once you get</br>   deported, especially when you get deported, when you come by your own</br>   decision, you know, you're good. But when you get deported and you just get</br>   arrested with no money in your pocket and then they let you out like that.</br>   And it is pretty hard because Mexico is dangerous. There's a lot of things</br>   that can happen to you and stuff. I'm glad I made it. I'm glad I'm here</br>   now. I'm glad I got a job. I'm not into that much trouble anymore. I have</br>   my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And now you have a child here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old is your kid here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: He's two.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Two. Are there any values or things that you feel like you want</br>   your kid to have, or what do you hope?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes, I do want my kid to- I want him to in the future, grow up,</br>   study as much as he can, get a career, be someone not like me. I want him</br>   to --That's why I only want one, so I can give him everything. I don't want</br>   any more kids. I mean, I'm not going to be able to give him everything.</br>   Might as well just keep one and give him all that I can.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you'd ever want your kid to go to</br>   the US and visit your family?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Of course, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do any education in the US, do everything here, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. I mean, I think he can do it here. I don't think there's no need</br>   for you to go to US. You can be someone here. You can study here, you can</br>   make a career.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: You don't necessarily need to go somewhere else. In the future, you</br>   never know if there would be an opportunity. I'm not going to stop him</br>   from... I don't know. There's a chance that in the future he decides that</br>   he wants to go over somewhere else or he wants... It just depends on him.</br>   I'm just going to support him through whatever he wants to do. As long as</br>   it's something good, I'm always going to just be there and support him.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's great. Yeah. That's what I wanted to hear from you, just</br>   your own personal experience, how you've changed because of it. That's a</br>   good note to end on.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
