 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: So, I think that's why. I don’t know. What else?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you end up crossing the border or did you get a visa?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I actually used somebody else's papers, somebody else's documents.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Mhm [affirmative].</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: So I basically...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's how you got over?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. I didn't cross the border or anything.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you remember your first moments in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. I remember that this lady, the one that took me over there,</br>   she just told me to go to sleep so I wouldn't have to talk or anything. And</br>   I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; It wasn't hard for me to go to sleep, so I just fell</br>   asleep. And when I woke up, I was over there, everything was so different.</br>   So I was surprised... I don't know. I felt good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was different?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I mean, you can see everything... It was just… the city was just</br>   more clean, or I don't know, it's just a lot of different stuff. The stores</br>   and buildings and everything was just different.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. A lot of people mentioned the air or the smell, even, was</br>   different.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And where did you end up living when you moved to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I grew up in Georgia. Before that, when I crossed over there, I</br>   stayed in Houston for like two months. And then we also went to Florida for</br>   another like two months.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then Houston was where you put in your roots a bit. And what</br>   was it like growing up in Houston? Did you know you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I did know. I mean, pretty much I grew up in Georgia...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, sorry, Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: At the beginning it was hard, going to school and not speaking</br>   English, everybody making fun of you, and it was hard. But then after a</br>   while you get used to it, and get the hang of it, started making friends</br>   and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you take ESL classes?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were those like?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: They were boring.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: But they were cool because we were all Hispanic people, so it felt</br>   good, than just being with a bunch of Americans. They didn't speak English</br>   that well, so it was better to be with our ESL team.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. More comfortable probably. Did you like school? Did you like</br>   any particular teachers, or not really for you?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Not really. Yeah, I didn't really like school, honestly.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What did you like outside of school?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I liked playing soccer, I liked playing soccer, but there's a lot of</br>   stuff going out there that gets your attention, all this partying and</br>   stuff. So yeah, I pretty much got into all that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old were you when you got into all that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was 14 when I started hanging out with those friends and-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were these friends just partying or were they also doing illegal</br>   activities?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, they were actually doing illegal activities, also. I got</br>   involved. I mean, I lived right there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Were these gangs or just casual groups?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, some of them. Well actually, a few of my cousins they</br>   were already involved in gangs, so it was pretty easy for me to get used to</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, slip into that lifestyle, I bet.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And that was when you were around 14 years old?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So did you stop playing soccer then, around there?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Mm-hmm (affirmative). I stopped playing soccer, then I left school</br>   When I was 15 I dropped out of school.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What grade was that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: That was in eighth grade, middle school, the last grade.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did your parents have anything to say about that or were they</br>   not...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: My mom she did not really say anything about that because I actually</br>   told her that I wanted to get a job because I was not doing good in school.</br>   So she was like, &quot;Okay, well, if you're going to do better by having a job,</br>   then just get a job. I'll help you get a job.&quot; Then she basically talked to</br>   one of her friends that she had, and he helped me to get a job. So I</br>   started working when I was 15. It was at a carpet mill.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What did you do there?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: We would get, how do you call them, big rolls of carpet? We would</br>   just have machines to cut them in different sizes and...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Big machines?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were they dangerous?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, because they're cutting machines and...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did they know you were 15? Or did you have to say?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: They didn't know I was 15 because I was obviously using a fake ID.</br>   So I was 15, but on that fake ID, I would supposedly be 27.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I mean they knew, but that's just how it is.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you make any friends at work?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I did have a lot of friends at work. Most of them just</br>   Hispanic people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Around your age, too?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: A few, like one or two that were my age. But I think I was the</br>   youngest one.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And this time you were also... Were you in the gang or just</br>   affiliated around it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I was in the gang.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the gang as well?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And what do you think drew you to that? Because one thing my</br>   professor's interested in is the sort of factors that draw or bring kids</br>   into gangs and that kind of activity, away from school and stuff, what the</br>   trends are. What was it in your case?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques</br>   that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say?</br>   Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that</br>   you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So would you say it was a pride thing or more protection?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, it's a pride thing. It's a pride thing. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, especially if you had family members who were already in it.</br>   That's on top of being sort of like brothers through that. You're also</br>   already by blood, as well.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So you were working and also doing this when you weren't</br>   working. So you were doing both simultaneously?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: When I started working, I didn't get to hang around with them that</br>   much, that’s when I didn't used to work, that’s when I was in school. But</br>   there was times, for example, on the weekends and everything, every weekend</br>   there would be someone there to pick me up and &quot;You know what? Let's go do</br>   this and that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was this and that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we</br>   would go to the bars, we would go to the parks. And if you see a rival</br>   gang, then we would just... Like we say, hit them up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Hit them up. Is that just start a fight?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Basically, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And that was from 15 years old to...</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: To like 17, 18.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: To 17. And then what happened when you were 17 or 18?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I kind of came down a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why was that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I got with a girl. She came to live with me. I dedicated more time</br>   to her. She didn't really let me go out that much because she knew what I</br>   was doing. Basically, it was for her that I came down.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have a child with her or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. Well she got pregnant one time, something went wrong, and she</br>   lost it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Like a miscarriage?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. She had a miscarriage.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you want the baby?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, no I did want the baby. Yeah. It was messed up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm sorry. I know, that's difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So then how old were you when you left the US, or how did you leave</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was 22. I was 22. 21 or 22.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What led to you leaving the US? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were the events leading up to deportation? What caused it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was driving without a license.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Driving without a license. And did they have any other record of</br>   you because of your affiliation when you were younger with gangs, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, gang-related.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it,</br>   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you</br>   treated? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come</br>   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal</br>   people, make you sign your deportation.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with</br>   any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You're going to sign this so you</br>   can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,</br>   also. I was 17 by then.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why were you arrested that time?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually</br>   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took</br>   me to jail.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were</br>   taken to jail at 17?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So then they had you in the system beforehand?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="4c9dcd3d-6023-4972-8a48-6f1f34cb0b89" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Arrest, Deportation, Prison, Challenges">Isabel: And then when you were arrested for driving without a license, they<br>
   looked that up. You weren't given the chance to fight your case or<br>
   anything?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Pablo: Yes, I was, but I didn't want to.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Yeah. Why was that? Just didn't want to spend that much time in<br>
   detention or anything?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, because I would see a lot of people that they'd be<br>
   fighting their case and they would be in jail for a year. And then after<br>
   that, they'd still get deported. So might as well just deport me right<br>
   away. I don't want to spend a lot of time just here, so that at the end you<br>
   can just go and deport me anyways.<br>

Or did you have to say?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: They didn't know I was 15 because I was obviously using a fake ID.</br>   So I was 15, but on that fake ID, I would supposedly be 27.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I mean they knew, but that's just how it is.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you make any friends at work?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I did have a lot of friends at work. Most of them just</br>   Hispanic people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Around your age, too?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: A few, like one or two that were my age. But I think I was the</br>   youngest one.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And this time you were also... Were you in the gang or just</br>   affiliated around it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, I was in the gang.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In the gang as well?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And what do you think drew you to that? Because one thing my</br>   professor's interested in is the sort of factors that draw or bring kids</br>   into gangs and that kind of activity, away from school and stuff, what the</br>   trends are. What was it in your case?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques</br>   that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say?</br>   Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that</br>   you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So would you say it was a pride thing or more protection?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, it's a pride thing. It's a pride thing. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, especially if you had family members who were already in it.</br>   That's on top of being sort of like brothers through that. You're also</br>   already by blood, as well.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. So you were working and also doing this when you weren't</br>   working. So you were doing both simultaneously?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: When I started working, I didn't get to hang around with them that</br>   much, that’s when I didn't used to work, that’s when I was in school. But</br>   there was times, for example, on the weekends and everything, every weekend</br>   there would be someone there to pick me up and &quot;You know what? Let's go do</br>   this and that.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was this and that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we</br>   would go to the bars, we would go to the parks. And if you see a rival</br>   gang, then we would just... Like we say, hit them up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Hit them up. Is that just start a fight?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Basically, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And that was from 15 years old to...</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: To like 17, 18.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: To 17. And then what happened when you were 17 or 18?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I kind of came down a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why was that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I got with a girl. She came to live with me. I dedicated more time</br>   to her. She didn't really let me go out that much because she knew what I</br>   was doing. Basically, it was for her that I came down.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have a child with her or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. Well she got pregnant one time, something went wrong, and she</br>   lost it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Like a miscarriage?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. She had a miscarriage.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you want the baby?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, no I did want the baby. Yeah. It was messed up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm sorry. I know, that's difficult.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So then how old were you when you left the US, or how did you leave</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was 22. I was 22. 21 or 22.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What led to you leaving the US? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were the events leading up to deportation? What caused it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was driving without a license.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Driving without a license. And did they have any other record of</br>   you because of your affiliation when you were younger with gangs, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, gang-related.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it,</br>   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you</br>   treated? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come</br>   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal</br>   people, make you sign your deportation.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with</br>   any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You're going to sign this so you</br>   can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,</br>   also. I was 17 by then.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why were you arrested that time?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually</br>   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took</br>   me to jail.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were</br>   taken to jail at 17?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So then they had you in the system beforehand?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then when you were arrested for driving without a license, they</br>   looked that up. You weren't given the chance to fight your case or</br>   anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes, I was, but I didn't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why was that? Just didn't want to spend that much time in</br>   detention or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, because I would see a lot of people that they'd be</br>   fighting their case and they would be in jail for a year. And then after</br>   that, they'd still get deported. So might as well just deport me right</br>   away. I don't want to spend a lot of time just here, so that at the end you</br>   can just go and deport me anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Were you still like with your girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: With what?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, sorry, you didn't have a child. I'm sorry. [inaudible 00:12:22]</br>   sensitive. So you were still with your girlfriend at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then, soon you're deported. Was that difficult to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, it was. She used to tell me that she wanted to come down here</br>   with me, but I was like... I was struggling over here, and it was not easy.</br>   So, I told her, &quot;You know what? I don't think it's a good idea. Because</br>   things are different, and you're not going to like it, and I don't want to</br>   tell you, 'Yes, come on over here and we're going to be fine.' And then</br>   what if you don't like it and then you get mad and you're going to be like,</br>   'It's your fault I came over here.'&quot; I didn't want none of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a big risk.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was she also undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, so if she came, she would have to probably stay as well.</br>   Could you tell me about, you said it was difficult reintegrating. Can you</br>   tell me a bit about your deportation? How you were deported and then what</br>   it was like being in Mexico, because again, it's almost like a new country.</br>   You spent so much time in the US. Just how is reintegrating into Mexican</br>   society?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Well, it is kind of difficult, because it was hard for me to</br>   get a job at first, because I didn't have any documents or any papers or</br>   anything. And my parents wouldn't help me, either because I was... I used</br>   to dress weird.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Weird?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. They always tell me I got a mean face. I don't know why, but</br>   everybody always tells me that. And since I used to dress baggy, they would</br>   look at me like…</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, thinking that you were becoming dangerous or something, or</br>   untrustworthy?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Because we've talked to a lot of people who have had similar</br>   experiences, were affiliated or part of gangs in the US and then were like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I want a second chance. I want to get the job here, do different</br>   things.&quot; And then maybe because of their tattoos and the way they present</br>   themselves, are then stereotyped as that way here, as well. So that was a</br>   bit of your experience?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So when you were reintegrating back, was it difficult? What were</br>   some of the biggest challenges finding a job, being separated from your</br>   girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, being separated from my mom, because actually I was over there</br>   with my mom and my mom's still over there. She's still living over there in</br>   Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And you're close with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. We talk a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you talk a lot now?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: By the phone, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Does she check in with you?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What do you talk about? Just anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, just how she's doing, how I'm doing, how things are over here,</br>   how things are over there. Kids over there, my little brothers and sisters.</br>   How they’re doing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So pretty much your whole family is back in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And how long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Six years now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Six years. Do you feel like it's gotten easier since you first came</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What's gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I got a better job now and that's basically... I live on my</br>   own now, I can pay my own things. Then when I got here, I had to be moving</br>   around with my aunts and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With your family members.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: With my family members, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So you had a bit of a support system, or... A little bit?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you get any help from any other organizations or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you were treated differently here because you</br>   lived in the US for some time? Or do you feel different than other people</br>   here? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. I don't feel different. I'm from here you know. I mean what gets</br>   me kind of upset is like you know, like I've seen people around here, some</br>   guys that I work with, they grew up in the US, and when they come here,</br>   they be like, &quot;Hey, where you from?&quot; They try to bring like the stuff from</br>   over there, over here. For example, I had some guys the other day come up</br>   to me and they're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; Because they come with the... How</br>   can I say it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: When you're in a gang in the US, you come up to see another gang</br>   member, you're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; And then you start all that stuff,</br>   you know. That upsets me kind of because we're in Mexico, and we're</br>   Mexican. I seen some people here, they'll be like, &quot;Ah, Well, I'm from</br>   Chicago, or I'm from LA or...&quot; Like that. I'm going to be like, “well then</br>   why are you here if you were from Chicago or if you were from LA? Or</br>   whatever you say you're from, you wouldn't be here, you know” I don't like</br>   saying that, because like I said, I do see people here that be like that.</br>   &quot;Well, I come from Chicago or I come from...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Okay, you come from over there, you grew up over there. But I mean,</br>   you're not even from over there. You're from here. I mean, that's something</br>   that just I don't...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So do you feel like you're more in touch with your Mexican roots or</br>   identity here than some other people you know coming in?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, yeah. I mean, if somebody comes up to me and be like, &quot;Where</br>   you from?&quot; I'm not going to be like, &quot;Well I'm from Georgia.&quot; No, I'm from</br>   here. I was born here. I lived over there, but that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Some people will say like, &quot;Oh, well, you're either like too</br>   American to be Mexican or too Mexican to be American.&quot; What's your response</br>   to that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I don't think I have a response to that. I'm just Mexican, that's</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's who I am.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: If you were in the US still, what do you think you'd be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Working.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Working. Do you know what job you'd want?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, you don't really have an option over there. You still illegal,</br>   so you got pretty much got to adapt to whatever there is. I don't mind. As</br>   long as I'm working, as long as I have a job, it don't really matter.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. And what are your plans for, now that you're in Mexico? What</br>   do you hope to do?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I just want to keep working. I don't know. Just in the future, maybe</br>   get a house, have my Mom come over here.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Be with your mother. Nice. Well, is there anything else you'd</br>   want people to know or experiences you should share?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, I think that's about it. It is pretty hard. And once you get</br>   deported, especially when you get deported, when you come by your own</br>   decision, you know, you're good. But when you get deported and you just get</br>   arrested with no money in your pocket and then they let you out like that.</br>   And it is pretty hard because Mexico is dangerous. There's a lot of things</br>   that can happen to you and stuff. I'm glad I made it. I'm glad I'm here</br>   now. I'm glad I got a job. I'm not into that much trouble anymore. I have</br>   my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And now you have a child here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old is your kid here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: He's two.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Two. Are there any values or things that you feel like you want</br>   your kid to have, or what do you hope?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes, I do want my kid to- I want him to in the future, grow up,</br>   study as much as he can, get a career, be someone not like me. I want him</br>   to --That's why I only want one, so I can give him everything. I don't want</br>   any more kids. I mean, I'm not going to be able to give him everything.</br>   Might as well just keep one and give him all that I can.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you'd ever want your kid to go to</br>   the US and visit your family?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Of course, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do any education in the US, do everything here, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. I mean, I think he can do it here. I don't think there's no need</br>   for you to go to US. You can be someone here. You can study here, you can</br>   make a career.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="157d88e7-7a22-4cdf-a4cc-f58ec4665d37" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Dreams, Children">Pablo: You don't necessarily need to go somewhere else.

   Pablo: Yeah, gang-related.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Pablo: No.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it,<br>
   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you<br>
   treated? What happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Pablo: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come<br>
   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal<br>
   people, make you sign your deportation.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Pablo: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with<br>
   any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You're going to sign this so you<br>
   can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,<br>
   also. I was 17 by then.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Why were you arrested that time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Pablo: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually<br>
   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took<br>
   me to jail.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were<br>
   taken to jail at 17?<br>

   much, that’s when I didn't used to work, that’s when I was in school. But<br>
   there was times, for example, on the weekends and everything, every weekend<br>
   there would be someone there to pick me up and &quot;You know what? Let's go do<br>
   this and that.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: What was this and that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Pablo: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we<br>
   would go to the bars, we would go to the parks. And if you see a rival<br>
   gang, then we would just... Like we say, hit them up.<br>
 <br>

   trends are. What was it in your case?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Pablo: In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques<br>
   that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say?<br>
   Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that<br>
   you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that's it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

She came to live with me. I dedicated more time</br>   to her. She didn't really let me go out that much because she knew what I</br>   was doing. Basically, it was for her that I came down.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have a child with her or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. Well she got pregnant one time, something went wrong, and she</br>   lost it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Like a miscarriage?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. She had a miscarriage.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you want the baby?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, no I did want the baby. Yeah. It was messed up.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm sorry.

I was 22. 21 or 22.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What led to you leaving the US?

What caused it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was driving without a license.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Driving without a license. And did they have any other record of</br>   you because of your affiliation when you were younger with gangs, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, gang-related.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it,</br>   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you</br>   treated? What happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come</br>   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal</br>   people, make you sign your deportation.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with</br>   any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You're going to sign this so you</br>   can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,</br>   also. I was 17 by then.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why were you arrested that time?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually</br>   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took</br>   me to jail.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were</br>   taken to jail at 17?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. So then they had you in the system beforehand?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then when you were arrested for driving without a license, they</br>   looked that up. You weren't given the chance to fight your case or</br>   anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes, I was, but I didn't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Why was that? Just didn't want to spend that much time in</br>   detention or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, because I would see a lot of people that they'd be</br>   fighting their case and they would be in jail for a year. And then after</br>   that, they'd still get deported. So might as well just deport me right</br>   away. I don't want to spend a lot of time just here, so that at the end you</br>   can just go and deport me anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Were you still like with your girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And your daughter?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: With what?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, sorry, you didn't have a child. I'm sorry. [inaudible 00:12:22]</br>   sensitive. So you were still with your girlfriend at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And then, soon you're deported. Was that difficult to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, it was. She used to tell me that she wanted to come down here</br>   with me, but I was like... I was struggling over here, and it was not easy.</br>   So, I told her, &quot;You know what? I don't think it's a good idea. Because</br>   things are different, and you're not going to like it, and I don't want to</br>   tell you, 'Yes, come on over here and we're going to be fine.' And then</br>   what if you don't like it and then you get mad and you're going to be like,</br>   'It's your fault I came over here.'&quot; I didn't want none of that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's a big risk.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was she also undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, so if she came, she would have to probably stay as well.</br>   Could you tell me about, you said it was difficult reintegrating. Can you</br>   tell me a bit about your deportation? How you were deported and then what</br>   it was like being in Mexico, because again, it's almost like a new country.</br>   You spent so much time in the US. Just how is reintegrating into Mexican</br>   society?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. Well, it is kind of difficult, because it was hard for me to</br>   get a job at first, because I didn't have any documents or any papers or</br>   anything. And my parents wouldn't help me, either because I was... I used</br>   to dress weird.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Weird?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. They always tell me I got a mean face. I don't know why, but</br>   everybody always tells me that. And since I used to dress baggy, they would</br>   look at me like…</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, thinking that you were becoming dangerous or something, or</br>   untrustworthy?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Because we've talked to a lot of people who have had similar</br>   experiences, were affiliated or part of gangs in the US and then were like,</br>   &quot;Okay, I want a second chance. I want to get the job here, do different</br>   things.&quot; And then maybe because of their tattoos and the way they present</br>   themselves, are then stereotyped as that way here, as well. So that was a</br>   bit of your experience?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So when you were reintegrating back, was it difficult? What were</br>   some of the biggest challenges finding a job, being separated from your</br>   girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, being separated from my mom, because actually I was over there</br>   with my mom and my mom's still over there. She's still living over there in</br>   Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And you're close with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah. We talk a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you talk a lot now?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: By the phone, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Does she check in with you?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What do you talk about? Just anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, just how she's doing, how I'm doing, how things are over here,</br>   how things are over there. Kids over there, my little brothers and sisters.</br>   How they’re doing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So pretty much your whole family is back in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And how long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Six years now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Six years. Do you feel like it's gotten easier since you first came</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What's gotten better?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, I got a better job now and that's basically... I live on my</br>   own now, I can pay my own things. Then when I got here, I had to be moving</br>   around with my aunts and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: With your family members.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: With my family members, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So you had a bit of a support system, or... A little bit?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you get any help from any other organizations or anything?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you feel like you were treated differently here because you</br>   lived in the US for some time? Or do you feel different than other people</br>   here? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. I don't feel different. I'm from here you know. I mean what gets</br>   me kind of upset is like you know, like I've seen people around here, some</br>   guys that I work with, they grew up in the US, and when they come here,</br>   they be like, &quot;Hey, where you from?&quot; They try to bring like the stuff from</br>   over there, over here. For example, I had some guys the other day come up</br>   to me and they're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; Because they come with the... How</br>   can I say it?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: When you're in a gang in the US, you come up to see another gang</br>   member, you're like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; And then you start all that stuff,</br>   you know. That upsets me kind of because we're in Mexico, and we're</br>   Mexican. I seen some people here, they'll be like, &quot;Ah, Well, I'm from</br>   Chicago, or I'm from LA or...&quot; Like that. I'm going to be like, “well then</br>   why are you here if you were from Chicago or if you were from LA? Or</br>   whatever you say you're from, you wouldn't be here, you know” I don't like</br>   saying that, because like I said, I do see people here that be like that.</br>   &quot;Well, I come from Chicago or I come from...&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Okay, you come from over there, you grew up over there. But I mean,</br>   you're not even from over there. You're from here. I mean, that's something</br>   that just I don't...</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So do you feel like you're more in touch with your Mexican roots or</br>   identity here than some other people you know coming in?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah, yeah. I mean, if somebody comes up to me and be like, &quot;Where</br>   you from?&quot; I'm not going to be like, &quot;Well I'm from Georgia.&quot; No, I'm from</br>   here. I was born here. I lived over there, but that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Some people will say like, &quot;Oh, well, you're either like too</br>   American to be Mexican or too Mexican to be American.&quot; What's your response</br>   to that?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I don't think I have a response to that. I'm just Mexican, that's</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's who I am.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: If you were in the US still, what do you think you'd be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Working.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Working. Do you know what job you'd want?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Well, you don't really have an option over there. You still illegal,</br>   so you got pretty much got to adapt to whatever there is. I don't mind. As</br>   long as I'm working, as long as I have a job, it don't really matter.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. And what are your plans for, now that you're in Mexico? What</br>   do you hope to do?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: I just want to keep working. I don't know. Just in the future, maybe</br>   get a house, have my Mom come over here.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Be with your mother. Nice. Well, is there anything else you'd</br>   want people to know or experiences you should share?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No, I think that's about it. It is pretty hard. And once you get</br>   deported, especially when you get deported, when you come by your own</br>   decision, you know, you're good. But when you get deported and you just get</br>   arrested with no money in your pocket and then they let you out like that.</br>   And it is pretty hard because Mexico is dangerous. There's a lot of things</br>   that can happen to you and stuff. I'm glad I made it. I'm glad I'm here</br>   now. I'm glad I got a job. I'm not into that much trouble anymore. I have</br>   my kid.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And now you have a child here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old is your kid here?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: He's two.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Two. Are there any values or things that you feel like you want</br>   your kid to have, or what do you hope?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Yes, I do want my kid to- I want him to in the future, grow up,</br>   study as much as he can, get a career, be someone not like me. I want him</br>   to --That's why I only want one, so I can give him everything. I don't want</br>   any more kids. I mean, I'm not going to be able to give him everything.</br>   Might as well just keep one and give him all that I can.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you'd ever want your kid to go to</br>   the US and visit your family?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: Of course, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do any education in the US, do everything here, or...?</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: No. I mean, I think he can do it here. I don't think there's no need</br>   for you to go to US. You can be someone here. You can study here, you can</br>   make a career.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Pablo: You don't necessarily need to go somewhere else. In the future, you</br>   never know if there would be an opportunity. I'm not going to stop him</br>   from... I don't know. There's a chance that in the future he decides that</br>   he wants to go over somewhere else or he wants... It just depends on him.</br>   I'm just going to support him through whatever he wants to do. As long as</br>   it's something good, I'm always going to just be there and support him.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's great. Yeah. That's what I wanted to hear from you, just</br>   your own personal experience, how you've changed because of it. That's a</br>   good note to end on.</br> </div><\p>
