They would stay at a specific job. Usually,<br>
   at first, they started off working in like el campo, which is like land<br>
   fields. So it was like picking up apples and peaches, cherries. But<br>
   Immigration would be there often. So you would just see like people scream,<br>
   &quot;la migra.&quot; And everybody would like run.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: So, they started looking for other things that weren't as dangerous<br>
   as that. So we moved to a different state where mostly the jobs there were<br>
   like fabricas.[factories] They stayed there, but then you would notice that<br>
   la migra también llegaba a las fábricas, [immigration authorities also went<br>
   to factories] So, they started migrating very often. Basically, just<br>
   keeping a down low on that and not trying to like be caught by La Migra.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Tim: You started school in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you remember where you started?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Honestly, I don't remember. I remember that every three, four</br>   months, five months, I was always the new girl. I would be changed from</br>   school super often. So I've been to a whole bunch of schools. The only</br>   school I remember that I went three years straight was Shiloh Park</br>   Elementary School. I went there three years straight, which was from third</br>   to sixth grade. But then when I was going to go middle school, we ended up</br>   changing to another city.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And when you started school, if you remember, did you know English?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No. It was really hard for me. I would get mad because I didn't</br>   want to go to school. I didn't understand what the teacher said to me. I</br>   didn't like going to school because I didn't understand anything. Then they</br>   started giving me like, &quot;Okay, you are going to be half your time here and</br>   half your time in a Spanish class.&quot; So that kind of helped me understand.</br>   And then when I was like in second grade, then they're like, &quot;Okay, you're</br>   ready to be in a full English class.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did you feel like people treated you differently when you didn't</br>   really know any English, or?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, actually that school in specific, I felt like there was a lot</br>   of help and they were – nos estaban apoyando mucho. [they helped us a lot.]</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Were there any specific people that you remember that really reached</br>   out and helped you?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes, but I don't even remember their names.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you remember what they did?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I guess there were social teachers, because this lady, she was</br>   bilingual so she would teach me in English and Spanish. So, she would teach</br>   me in English and if I didn't understand, she would just tell me in Spanish</br>   and then showed me what it was or how to say it in English.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And were you able to make friends moving around so frequently?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, there were friends, but it was like, &quot;Oh okay. I have to go</br>   now. Bye.&quot; So I never actually grew up with a best friend.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: How did that make you feel that you are missing out on such an</br>   important part of childhood, having one or a couple of good friends?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, you get used to it. Because here in Mexico, I've been here</br>   for like nine years, and I still don't have like one best friend. So it's</br>   like, &quot;Okay, friends come and go.&quot; I mean, they're always going to be</br>   there, but you're always going to meet new people.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did you finish school in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I got to seventh grade, then when I was 14, my parents decided to</br>   come back to Mexico. So, here, I had to go back to middle school for like</br>   four months and then to high school again.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: You guys came back voluntarily?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And going to school in Mexico when you started?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Were people mean to you because you had spent time in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes, but I mean, okay. The first thing I noticed in Mexican school</br>   is that they don't even have toilet paper in the bathrooms. So it's like,</br>   &quot;Okay. Did somebody forget to put toilet paper?&quot; &quot;No, you have to bring</br>   your own.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay, that's so weird.&quot; And then it's like, everybody</br>   would think, I guess it's like they make themselves feel less because they</br>   think that you think that you’re better than them just because you know</br>   English and you were in the States and so on.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So they would be like, &quot;ay la gringa se cree mucho porque viene de</br>   los Estados Unidos y habla inglés.” [the gringa is full of herself because</br>   she’s come from the United States and speaks English] It's like, &quot;No bro,</br>   I'm nothing like that.&quot; So yeah, that was like ignorant children. But then</br>   you'll see that the teachers are just as ignorant because they're like, “Ay</br>   Jeimmy, lee la página tal&quot; [Ay Jeimmy, read this page] I can't read. I</br>   don't know. I can barely speak Spanish. You want me to read it?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So I would be like, &quot;el carro” [the car] and everybody would start</br>   laughing because I can't roll my R's. It's like, a ver di carro, di carro,</br>   di ferrocarril,&quot; [let’s see, say car, say car, say train] (In American</br>   accent) and I can't roll my R's. So, they'll make fun of my accent. And</br>   yeah, the teacher was horrible, and the students were also. In the four</br>   months that I was just in middle school, I saw how a teacher grabbed his</br>   seatbelt and whooped the student [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Oh my God,</br>   this would not happen in the States.&quot; So it's really, really different.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you mentioned right there that there's like the teachers act very</br>   differently.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Can you explain that a little bit more? Do they teach differently too,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I would say they don't even teach you it. They just go to waste</br>   their time on you and get paid off of it. Because in the three months that</br>   I was there, I honestly don't remember learning anything. Like nothing. It</br>   was just like going and wasting my time because I was going for like two</br>   weeks and then this teacher, she -- se fracturó la mano and so le dieron</br>   incapacidad. [she broke her arm and was put on disability]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And they were trying to look for a substitute teacher. So while</br>   they were looking for a substitute teacher, we were like three weeks</br>   without a teacher. So you could imagine kids just coming in and out of the</br>   classroom, throwing stuff. Everybody was doing whatever they wanted. And</br>   then they found a substitute teacher, but the kids were so horrible that</br>   the substitute teacher left crying and didn't come back.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So this other teacher, le decian el padrino, [they called him the</br>   godfather] because literally, era el padrino [he was the godfather] like</br>   everybody there. So, he comes in with like typical macho Mexicano with his</br>   mustache beard, bien cabron. [a right bastard] And he comes in there and</br>   everybody's like, “oh el padrino viene el padrino.” [oh, the godfather, the</br>   godfather’s coming] So like Everybody's like quiet. And one of them, he was</br>   just like, &quot;I don't care, que esto y el otro&quot; [this and that] He was</br>   fucking ... I'm sorry. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He was from one table to another. He was literally like on top of</br>   the tables jumping from one table to another. So el padrino comes in and</br>   he's like, &quot;Get down from there.&quot; And he's like, &quot;No, que esto y el otro.&quot;</br>   He's like, &quot;Get down from there.&quot; &quot;No, I'm not going to get down. What are</br>   you going to do about it?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He takes his belt off and he's like, “One, two, three.” And you</br>   just see him just sit down. Like nothing happened. And then he starts</br>   putting order. Like, &quot;I'm tired of you guys always doing whatever you guys</br>   want, que esto y el otro.&quot; And everybody's like, &quot;Oh my God. Did he just</br>   whoop him?” “Yeah, he did.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So it stayed quiet for a while, but then he left. Then everybody</br>   started making fun of the kid that got whooped by a teacher. And yeah, that</br>   was basically like the most impact made during my middle school experience</br>   here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And then you went to high school after?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I went to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Was that similar to what middle school was?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, nothing. Kids or teenagers were more open minded. Instead of</br>   making fun of me because I knew English, they would be like, &quot;Oh, you know</br>   English. Okay, let's hang out. I can teach you Spanish, you can teach me</br>   English. I can teach you math and you can teach me English.&quot; So they were</br>   more like, &quot;Okay, let's help out each other.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And the teachers, they were all so different. The English teacher</br>   was like, &quot;Oh, okay, you know English. Perfect. Just do one examen [exam]</br>   and whatever you get on that examen, va ser tu calificación para todo el</br>   semestre.&quot; [exam will be your grade for the semester]And I'm like, &quot;Okay,</br>   10, there you go.&quot; A 10 for the whole semester. I didn't have to go to the</br>   classes because the teacher already knew that I knew English.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So she was like, &quot;If you want to be here, to help the other</br>   students, it's fine with me.&quot; So yeah, I would just go whenever I wanted to</br>   and help out the other students, and basically that's it. So my experience</br>   in high school was a lot better. A lot better than middle school.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Besides school when you came back, was it hard to like reintegrate</br>   yourself in Mexican culture after living in the US first for long?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. I think it took me like about two years to integrate into</br>   myself. Because specifically in high school, I started... there's Spanish</br>   and there's Chilango. So, Chilango is way different than Spanish. They're</br>   like, &quot;y tienes carnales?” &quot; And I'm like, &quot;carnales, what's that?&quot; &quot;si</br>   tienes hermanos?” And I'm like, &quot;Oh yeah, I have two brothers.&quot; Oh, okay.</br>   And they would use those words, no?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, I started like learning them. “Oh yeah. carnal significa</br>   [carnal means] brother.” What other words did they use? They would use</br>   expressions like, “ay ese hombre es un Don Juan,” [that man is a Don Juan]</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Who's Don Juan?&quot; And they're like, &quot;Oh no. It just means</br>   that he's a player,&quot; and words like that. So I was like, &quot;Oh, okay. This is</br>   like pretty weird, but I like it. It's cool.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So when I was in high school, this kid, he was like the most—I</br>   don't know, he was very hyperactive, but he was cool. He's like, &quot;Hey</br>   Jeimmy,&quot; because everybody was like in break, &quot;Hey Jeimmy.&quot; I'm like,</br>   “que?” He's like, &quot;ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre,&quot; [did you manage to ring</br>   the doorbell] and I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, Jeimmy,</br>   ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre?&quot; and everybody's laughing, and I'm like, “I</br>   don't know what you're talking about.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: &quot;Si Jeimmy si ya tocas el timbre, el timbre de tu casa?.&quot; [have you</br>   rung the doorbell of your house] And I'm like, &quot;mi casa no tiene timbre.”</br>   [my house doesn’t have a doorbell] So everybody just starts laughing at me,</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Oh my God, what did I say?&quot; So later on, I tell my friend,</br>   I'm like, &quot;What did he mean?&quot; And she's laughing at me and she can't stop</br>   laughing at me. And then she's like, &quot;Okay, he basically asked you if</br>   you've already had sex. But your response was, my house doesn't have a</br>   doorbell. So, it's pretty funny.&quot; And I was like, “Oh, okay.”</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So yeah, you start learning all these expressions, all these some</br>   double centered words. And I mean it took me a while to learn it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And coming back, the food is different in Mexico than it is in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. You know what I hate about Mexican stores? They never fridge</br>   milk. It's like you'd go and ask for a leche, y te dan una leche al tiempo</br>   [milk, and they give you milk at room temperature] It's like, “Bro, why</br>   don't you put it in the fridge. It tastes so good when it's cold.” [Tim</br>   laughs]. Sugar tastes different. Even water tastes different. Everything's</br>   so different.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Are there any like specific American foods that you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: That I miss? Not really. A couple years back, I used to miss like</br>   cranberry sauce, I used to miss gravy, I used to miss candies, like salt</br>   water taffy, like a whole bunch of candies that here in Mexico don't exist.</br>   But then the years pass by and you stop, I don't know, ya no se te antoja,</br>   [you don’t crave it] You're like, &quot;Okay, it's fine.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Okay. So besides the food, is there anything that you miss a lot about</br>   the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I miss the cleanness. It's true that it's greener on the other</br>   side. Everybody can notice that. I miss how you could go to the park and</br>   everything was like, the grass was all green. You would see like—well at</br>   least where I used to live, there was a small pond where you can go throw</br>   bread at ducks. I miss the security that you feel when you call 911 and in</br>   five minutes, the cops are there.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think that's something I really miss a lot, because here, you</br>   could say, &quot;Oh my God, if something happens to me and they call the cops,</br>   they are going to be here like an hour later, and they're not even going to</br>   be here prepared. They're just going to like, nada mas es presencia</br>   [they’re just present] because they're not even prepared for it.&quot; So I</br>   guess that's something that I missed too.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, did you trust the police in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. I always grew up believing that police were good men. Police</br>   are different from ICE. So, La Migra was different from a regular cop. So I</br>   would always trust cops.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And here you don't trust?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, no. No, aqui no. [no, no, here no.] At least I haven't seen a</br>   cop do a good deed. You usually see them like trying to stop people just to</br>   check them and see if they have anything on them.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Is there anything that you don't miss about the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something I don't miss about the States?</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Is there something that you hated about it when you were there?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, no, not really. I enjoyed the time I was there, and they</br>   would tell me, &quot;Do you want to go back?&quot; I would probably say no, but I</br>   mean it was nice.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Why wouldn't you want to go?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Because I feel free here. I have my family here. I might not see a</br>   grass and ponds and so what, but I see my city and el Monumento de la</br>   Revolución , el Angel. I've been to other states like Cancun. Cancun is</br>   beautiful. I would rather be in Cancun than in the States. And you also</br>   make dollars in Cancun. So I mean it's nice.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, do you see yourself as more American or more Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I would say both. [Chuckles]. That was a tough one. Yeah. Both.</br>   Because I mean, I have Mexican blood. You can see me physically and I look</br>   Mexican. But my taste in music isn't that Mexican. My ideal isn't as the</br>   same as a Mexican mind. And well, yeah, I mean you can say I'm like an</br>   Oreo. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What music do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I like electronic music. For example, I like Adela, I like Amy</br>   Winehouse. I love a lot of, well like Charlie Puth, I don't know. I like</br>   that type of music. But I also like not necessarily Mexican, but Latina.</br>   For example, I like Calle Trece. Calle Trece I think is like Puerto Rican</br>   or something like that. I love Calle Trece. What I don't like that's</br>   Mexican, and people criticize me for that, is I don't like Banda. I don't</br>   like Nortenas, I don't like soccer, for example. [Interview laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Right now, this month has been horrible for me. I can't listen. I</br>   can't go on Facebook without seeing memes about soccer. Yeah. So it's</br>   basically that.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you like American sports?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I like football. Yes, I like football. I love it. Because I also</br>   have that. I prefer American men than Mexican men. So if you look at like</br>   ... I mean guys make fun of girls because of this. Girls only see soccer</br>   because they see the guy. But it's true. I mean honestly, it is true. I</br>   like seeing football because I mean it's a savage game where you see men</br>   pushing each other and throwing them against each other, and it's pretty</br>   cool.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But you also see really handsome men. And for me, it's hard to find</br>   a handsome man in Mexico. Don't you agree? [Everyone laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What American football players do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Honestly, I don't know them. I don't. No, let me see if I remember.</br>   When I was in fifth grade, that was when I was like mostly into football</br>   because my teacher, she used to love football. So she's the one that</br>   involved me in all that. I don't remember the player. There was a player</br>   that she loved, and she was like, &quot;Oh my God, he's so cute.&quot; And I started,</br>   I'm like, &quot;Yeah, he is cute.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But honestly, I don't even remember their names. I just know</br>   they're cute. And that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: If you had children, would you raise them in an American way or the</br>   Mexican way, or both?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Both. Because it would be like you would pick the best out of both</br>   sides. For example, in America, if you have garbage, pick it up and take it</br>   with you until you find the garbage can.” And the Mexican version would be</br>   like—how can I say it? I don't know. It's just that my parents raised me</br>   like… I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: American people are more like anti-violence, I guess. Like if your</br>   kid comes to you and they tell you that they're being bullied, you would go</br>   directly to the principal and you would speak with the principal, right? So</br>   it's like, &quot;Okay, my kid's being bullied in your school, what are you going</br>   to do about it?&quot; And the director would try to find a solution or what so</br>   on. And here in Mexico, if you go and tell, &quot;les van haciendo burla a tu</br>   hijo” [they are teasing/picking on your son] he would be like, &quot;Okay, well,</br>   I can't do anything about it. I can’t be just behind your kid all day.&quot; So</br>   what happened here in Mexico would be like, “mira mi amor si te pega,</br>   [listen my love if they hit you] you better whoop their butt. Because if</br>   not, coming home, I'm going to whoop your butt.” So that would be like the</br>   Mexican part. So yeah, I guess I would get like on both sides.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Okay. So now going away from that, because I messed up. [Both laugh].</br>   Are you happy that you spent time in the United States, or do you wish—</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, I'm glad. My life was always like up and down and from left to</br>   right because I never had a stable home, never had a stable school, and</br>   never with stable people. But at the end of the day, that affected me in a</br>   way that right now, as an adult, I can't stay more than two years in one</br>   place. I'm like, &quot;Okay, I need to go. I need to either get a new job or go</br>   live somewhere else.”</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: That's why I've been to Cancun and Veracruz and all these places.</br>   And I'm glad, I mean that. My parents had that dream and followed it. And</br>   they made me part of it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And so, were you happy that they brought you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: At the beginning? I was super happy because I was like, &quot;Oh yes, I</br>   will see my abuelita.&quot; [grandmother] Because in the States, I would always</br>   adopt grandmas. For example, we used to live in this black neighborhood.</br>   So, there was this black lady who I always would call her “Abuelita.” And</br>   she was like, &quot;mi abuelita negra.&quot; It was pretty cool. But after so many</br>   years of not actually seeing your grandma, it's like the best.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Earlier you mentioned like right when you got back, people were mean</br>   to you about how you spoke and things like that. How did it make you feel</br>   at the time that people from your home country, that this was where you</br>   were born, weren't treating you nicely?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, I always thought that knowing English wasn't something bad. I</br>   always considered it like, &quot;Okay, I'm not wrong. You guys are the ones that</br>   are wrong. And I want to see you guys in 10 years and see what you got to</br>   tell me about that.&quot; And yeah, I mean, nine years later, eight years later,</br>   I'm here working at a bilingual call center.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think my life isn't that bad. And I see my middle school people</br>   that were making fun of me, they're like pregnant, mamas luchonas</br> </br> </br>   Tim: But you don't have kids?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Right. [Both laugh]. You would see mamas luchonas, you would see</br>   people ... It's not ningún trabajo es malo [no job is bad]as long as it's a</br>   decent job. But I mean like, why would you make fun of my English? You're</br>   going to end up like that. Right? Time speaks for itself.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: You mentioned a while ago, when you were talking about differences</br>   between US and Mexico, that you think your ideals are American and you</br>   think like an American. Can you speak a little more about that?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: For example, here in Mexico, it's always like, primero yo, después</br>   yo y al ultimo yo. [first me, next me, and last me] So everybody's like, yo</br>   te chingo a ti antes de que tu me chingas a mi. [ I’ll fuck you before you</br>   can fuck me] You can speak to any Mexican and that's basically their</br>   mentality. And I'm not like that. I'm like, &quot;I'll help you, hoy por mi,</br>   manana por ti.” [today from me, tomorrow from you] So I'll help you today</br>   and I expect, or I hope, that you help me tomorrow. So, that's one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something else, I don't know why. This isn’t general, but the</br>   majority of women in Mexico or girls these days, they're 14, 15 years old,</br>   and they're already getting pregnant and having kids when they barely</br>   finished middle school. So it's like everybody looks at me, or at least in</br>   my family, and it's like, &quot;Oh, Jeimmy, why haven't you gotten married yet?&quot;</br>   Like, &quot;I'm 22 years old. I still live with my parents. Why would I get</br>   married?&quot; [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I have like cousins, siblings, that they're 14, 15 years old and</br>   they already had kids. They have a horrible life because they can barely</br>   get a job, they can barely feed their kids. I don't know for what reason.</br>   For them, it was urgent to just get pregnant. So, that's not general, but</br>   at least that's what I've noticed here in Mexico: that the majority of</br>   teenage girls just want to get pregnant as soon as possible.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So do you think your views on getting pregnant and starting a</br>   family were formed by your experiences in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. Because in the States, you see women that are 30 years, and</br>   they're getting married at 30 years.. So, you're like, &quot;Oh, she enjoyed her</br>   teenage years, she enjoyed her life, she already did, and so on, whatever</br>   she wanted to. And now that she's ready, she's going to get married, she's</br>   going to have kids, and everything's going to be perfect.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But here in Mexico, they get pregnant at 16, they leave their kids</br>   with their grandma, and go party and do whatever they wanted to do during</br>   their age. And then it's like the little changes goes on. Then they're like</br>   30 years old, their kids are 15 years old, and they're already like</br>   grandmas. So it's like a little cycle that just goes on and on.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And I have a neighbor that's 32 and she's already a grandma with</br>   four nietos, four grandkids. So, it's like, “Wow.”</br> </br> </br>   Briana: Do you think that in the US there is more of an allowance for</br>   having your life before you start having kids? Do you think there's more</br>   opportunities for that and that's why women don't get pregnant this early?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think it's because when you're a teenager over there, it's like</br>   your parents, they worry on giving you material stuff. In the States, the</br>   government helps you with food vouchers, there's Goodwill, there's</br>   Salvation Army where you can go to the store and buy Levi jeans for a</br>   dollar or two. So it's like the government actually helps you. Like, &quot;If</br>   you're poor, it's fine. We'll help you feed yourself and we'll help you</br>   with clothes. All you have to do is like, I don't know, just put in $20 for</br>   a cell phone.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And here, it's not like that. It's like the government doesn't help</br>   you in anything. So people don't care about a cell phone. They don't care</br>   about a computer. They just want to feed their kids. So these kids just</br>   grow up thinking that they're always limited. They're always limited to not</br>   being able to have this because their parents can't afford it.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, they start getting a boyfriend, their boyfriend buys them</br>   clothes, buys them this, buys them that. They believe that moving in with</br>   their boyfriends at 15 years old is going to remove them from that</br>   poorness, or their boyfriend is going to give them better opportunities</br>   than their parents.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But then they start actually taking a taste of life. Like, &quot;Oh no</br>   sweetie, it's not just this. We got to pay rent, we got to pay food, we got</br>   to pay the baby's diapers.&quot; So at the end, they're worse than if they</br>   would've just stayed with their parents. And I guess a lot of teens take</br>   that decision and make that error because they don't really know what life</br>   is.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, I have another question about school, if it's okay to go back to</br>   that for a second. So when you came back to Mexico, did you know anything</br>   about Mexican history?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Nothing hasta la fecha, [still today] I don't know el himno</br>   nacional, [the national anthem]I don't know who Pancho Villa is, I don't</br>   know who Benito Juarez is, I don't know who Sor Juana is. The only time I</br>   heard about Sor Juana is when my dad was listening to a Nortena song from</br>   Los Tigres del Norte which says something about narcotraficantes [drug</br>   traffickers] and stuff and a mi me dicen Sor Juana a mi me dicen sorpresa.</br>   [they call me Sor Juana, they call me surprise] And they take out their</br>   cuernos de chivo [guns] and start shooting everybody. So that's the only</br>   thing I ever heard about Sor Juana.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   And I come here in Mexico, and they're like, &quot;Oh vas a ir a la</br>   telesecundaria.&quot; [oh you are going to tele - high school] And I'm like,</br>   &quot;Okay, first of all, what's a telesecundaria?&quot; &quot;No, es que allí te enseñan</br>   con pura tele.&quot; So, aqui te ensenan con pura tele, [no, it’s that they</br>   teach you only by TV there] there's no teachers?&quot; &quot; And I'm like, &quot;Okay. So</br>   there’s no teachers? “Si pero, pues las maestras prenden la tele y te</br>   enseñan con la tele.”. [yes, but the teachers turn on the TV and teach you</br>   by TV] And I’m like, so if we learn off of the TV, then how are we like “de</br>   que me sirve tener la maestra allí.” [what’s the point of having a teacher</br>   there?] So, it's like super complicated. It was the worst thing ever.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you mentioned you didn't know the national anthem of Mexico or the</br>   national song. Do you know the pledge of allegiance of the US, the national</br>   anthem of the US? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. I know the pledge of allegiance.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: Did you say it in school?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. For eight years? No, for 12 years? Well I was 12 years in the</br>   States. So I guess like from kindergarten to seventh grade, every day.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you still remember it?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes, but I don't want to sing it. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: [Laughs]. So, let me see. Do you have anything else that you want to</br>   add? I'm still thinking if I have more questions, but I want to give you an</br>   opportunity.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something to add? Well no, not really. [Laughs]. It's just so many</br>   stories I could tell you, but right now I can't think of any.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: You still live with your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What is that like? I know you mentioned that just about everyone else</br>   has moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, it's pretty funny. It's weird I guess because everybody's</br>   independent. But I love living with my parents. I help them pay, because</br>   it's their own house—they don't rent, it's their house. So, it's just like</br>   paying maintenance, paying water, paying the internet. And I get my own</br>   room. I'm comfortable, but I do have occasions where I just want to move</br>   out.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Because, if I ever have a boyfriend—I'm a loner so I've been single</br>   for like two years. [Chuckles]. But if I ever have a boyfriend, it’s going</br>   to be like how am I going to go in my house with my parents and my</br>   boyfriend there? And so, I do have occasions where I do want to be</br>   independent and rent my own place.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did your parents learn English in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: My dad, he understands it and he speaks it. Pero su inglés es un</br>   inglés paisa, like real paisa, [his English is a real paisa English] like</br>   what time is it?, Like, open the dooro or I'll break the window.” (In</br>   Spanish accents) And my mom, she can understand it like 70% and speak it</br>   like 30%. But if I speak to my dad, he'll understand and he'll respond.</br>   Very mocho, but he'll respond.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did they become American too?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. My dad did. My dad here in Mexico, he's very like esos son mis</br>   derechos [these are my rights] very contra-. I don't know. He's always—</br> </br> </br>   Briana: You think it is an American mindset?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. Yes. Because in the States, you're always—I mean, it's not bad</br>   [Laughs]—but you're always complaining about everything. Like, you give me</br>   bad customer service? I'm complaining about it. You gave me this one cent</br>   higher? I'm complaining about it. And it's perfectly fine because that way</br>   you know your human rights. And nobody can come in to ruin it.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: My dad got that mentality, like esta va contra mis derechos, [this</br>   is against my rights] like, &quot;You can't do this.&quot; Or when we had a huge</br>   trouble subscribing my brothers to school because they're American. They</br>   needed like infinity of paperwork. And my dad's like, &quot;Okay. So me estas</br>   diciendo que les estas negando los estudios a mi hijo por esto, esto y lo</br>   otro,” [you are denying my son his studies for this, that and the other]</br>   And they're like, &quot;No, we're not denying him.&quot; -&quot;No entonces?.&quot;[no, so?]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Like, &quot;Okay they would be like esto y lo otro&quot; He's like, &quot;No, no.</br>   Okay. Tell me once again, are you denying my ...&quot; So, he would like se pone</br>   en ese plan, [he’d get like that] and teachers would be like, &quot;Okay. Esta</br>   bien meta a tus hijos.” [it’s fine, enroll your sons]</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, do you think it's really beneficial that he has this mentality?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. Yes, it is.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So your brothers were born in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. I have two brothers that were born in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: What is it like for them having citizenship here as well as US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: For them, it was really hard. I have two brothers. Currently, one</br>   is 19 and the other one is 15. So, nos llevamos todos por [we hadn’t been</br>   together] four years. So my brother, when he came back, it was like… he's</br>   tall and he's like handsome. So Mexican girls weren't used to tall,</br>   handsome guys. Because everybody here's like chaparritos, morenitos.</br>   [small, dark]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: They might be cute, but they're chaparritos and morenitos. So,</br>   everybody was like, &quot;Alexis, Alexis&quot;—because his name is Eduardo Alexis.</br>   But he's like, &quot;I'm going to tell them my name is Alexis.&quot; [Laughs]. So, it</br>   was like, &quot;Oh, Alexis&quot; [High pitched voice]. And his friends, or the other</br>   guys around him, would start getting jealous and they would be like, &quot; que?</br>   te sientes muy chingon, que este y el otro.” [you feel really cool, this</br>   and that]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: This is where the Mexican mentality comes in, where my dad always</br>   taught them, &quot;If you're going to fight with somebody, you better whoop</br>   their butt or else, I'm going to whoop yours.&quot; So my brother was always</br>   like, &quot;You're never going to make me feel less, and we'll fight before you</br>   make me feel less.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, my brother for like two months was fighting at least three</br>   times a week with somebody because they were always like, &quot;te sientes muy</br>   chingon porque eres gringo.&quot; [you feel really cool because you are a</br>   gringo] Like, &quot;Like no no me siento, pero si quieres te lo demuestro.” [no,</br>   I don’t but I if you want I can show you] And he was always like, ganando</br>   territorio, ganando barrio, [gaining territory, gaining neighborhood] I</br>   guess it would be?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He went through a hard time because he was actually having to prove</br>   that he was worth enough to be in the hood with all these people. Because</br>   in Mexico or, well, at least where I live, it’s cerro [mountains (rural)].</br>   So the first generation is our grandparents. Our grandparents first got</br>   there. Then my parents grew up there and they had their kids.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So all these generations have been there for years. When I got to</br>   Mexico, I would see this old lady: &quot;Oh I remember you. You were like two</br>   years old when I met you,&quot; or, they would ask me a lot, “tu de quien eres?”</br>   [whose are you?] and I would be like, &quot;soy hija de Keto” I am Keto’s</br>   daughter] Because they use like—how do you say it—apodos? [nicknames]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, a mi papá le decían el Keto, [my dad was called Keto] So, I</br>   would be like, “soy hija de Keto.” [I am Keto’s daughter] And they're like,</br>   &quot;oh, eres nieta de Emilia.” [you are Emilia’s granddaughter] And I'm like,</br>   yeah. So, that's how they identify like who you are.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: By your family?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: It's basically that. That my brother had to prove to everybody else</br>   that he was worth being there, that he was also Mexican, and that he could</br>   be as good as them for just living there.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So did they view his living in the United States and his being born</br>   in the United States as something negative?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: They see it as something higher than them, and they just can't</br>   accept it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you're happy to be back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Are your parents too?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. My dad, he still has that mentality of wanting to go back.</br>   And it's because when he left Mexico, he may have a -- una profesion. [a</br>   profession] He got over there and, like I told you, he was pitching</br>   peaches, cherries. Then he was working at a fabric. But then, one day, he</br>   saw a sign that said, &quot;We need welders.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Oh, necesitan</br>   soldadores, [the need welders] but I don't know how to weld. But I'm going</br>   to go anyway.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, he found the supervisor and he's like, &quot;Oh, you're Mexican,</br>   huh?&quot; He's like, “Yeah.” &quot;Oh, okay. Well then.&quot; And my dad is like,</br>   “[Nervous noise].’ It was horrible, but he's like, &quot;Okay, I'm going to show</br>   you how to weld.&quot; So my dad started learning how to be a welder and became</br>   an ingeniero industrial. [industrial engineer] So, he knows a lot of things</br>   that is not very common here in Mexico. He knows how to do it.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, he would start looking for jobs where he said, “If I weld this,</br>   just to do it, because this whole thing costs like 10,000 pesos, they're</br>   already like, ‘I'm getting paid, I don't know, 3000 for it. Y nada mas’”</br>   Like 10 minutes of doing it, the company was already getting paid thousands</br>   of pesos for it. And he was only getting paid like 1,000 and change a week.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, he's like, &quot;I'm working for this company that's making</br>   thousands of pesos, y a mi nada mas me pagan 1000 pesos a la semana. &quot;</br>   [they are only paying me 1000 pesos a week] So he didn't like that. He's</br>   like, &quot;They're not paying me enough for what I know how to do.&quot; So he</br>   started looking for more and more jobs, and he started noticing that jobs</br>   that have nothing to do what he does pay more than what he actually knows</br>   how to do.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So he became like chofer de metrobus,[bus driver] he became like</br>   taxista, [taxi driver] and he's like, &quot;I don't like this. I don't like</br>   being a chofer. [driver] I want to do what I like doing. But it's not paid</br>   well here, so I want to go back to the States and work over there.&quot; So</br>   yeah, that's basically why he wants to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: If your parents do go back, do you think you might or you—</br> </br> </br>   <span id="1476b4e0-66f6-4405-b8d8-f09d311e03d6" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in the US">Jeimmy: Oh no.

 <br>
   Tim: Your brothers who are both American citizens have they considered<br>
   going back or do they?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: Yes. My 19 -year old brother, I don't know why he hasn't left yet.<br>
   He would have already left. But I guess he doesn't want to, I don't know.<br>
   And my 15- year old brother, he's like indeciso. [undecided] Because he was<br>
   like five years old when we came back. So he forgot English. He understands<br>
   it, but he doesn't speak it well. So he's like, &quot;If I do go back, I want to<br>
   go back with someone because I don't know much English.&quot; So yeah, he's<br>

   about a computer. They just want to feed their kids. So these kids just<br>

   Salvation Army where you can go to the store and buy Levi jeans for a<br>
   dollar or two. So it's like the government actually helps you. Like, &quot;If<br>
   you're poor, it's fine. We'll help you feed yourself and we'll help you<br>

   For them, it was urgent to just get pregnant. So, that's not general, but<br>

  </span> Tim: So, do you see yourself as more American or more Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I would say both. [Chuckles]. That was a tough one. Yeah. Both.</br>   Because I mean, I have Mexican blood. You can see me physically and I look</br>   Mexican. But my taste in music isn't that Mexican. My ideal isn't as the</br>   same as a Mexican mind. And well, yeah, I mean you can say I'm like an</br>   Oreo. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What music do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I like electronic music. For example, I like Adela, I like Amy</br>   Winehouse. I love a lot of, well like Charlie Puth, I don't know. I like</br>   that type of music. But I also like not necessarily Mexican, but Latina.</br>   For example, I like Calle Trece. Calle Trece I think is like Puerto Rican</br>   or something like that. I love Calle Trece. What I don't like that's</br>   Mexican, and people criticize me for that, is I don't like Banda. I don't</br>   like Nortenas, I don't like soccer, for example. [Interview laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Right now, this month has been horrible for me. I can't listen. I</br>   can't go on Facebook without seeing memes about soccer. Yeah. So it's</br>   basically that.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you like American sports?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I like football. Yes, I like football. I love it. Because I also</br>   have that. I prefer American men than Mexican men. So if you look at like</br>   ... I mean guys make fun of girls because of this. Girls only see soccer</br>   because they see the guy. But it's true. I mean honestly, it is true. I</br>   like seeing football because I mean it's a savage game where you see men</br>   pushing each other and throwing them against each other, and it's pretty</br>   cool.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But you also see really handsome men. And for me, it's hard to find</br>   a handsome man in Mexico. Don't you agree?

The first thing I noticed in Mexican school</br>   is that they don't even have toilet paper in the bathrooms. So it's like,</br>   &quot;Okay. Did somebody forget to put toilet paper?&quot; &quot;No, you have to bring</br>   your own.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay, that's so weird.&quot; And then it's like, everybody</br>   would think, I guess it's like they make themselves feel less because they</br>   think that you think that you’re better than them just because you know</br>   English and you were in the States and so on.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So they would be like, &quot;ay la gringa se cree mucho porque viene de</br>   los Estados Unidos y habla inglés.” [the gringa is full of herself because</br>   she’s come from the United States and speaks English] It's like, &quot;No bro,</br>   I'm nothing like that.&quot; So yeah, that was like ignorant children. But then</br>   you'll see that the teachers are just as ignorant because they're like, “Ay</br>   Jeimmy, lee la página tal&quot; [Ay Jeimmy, read this page] I can't read. I</br>   don't know. I can barely speak Spanish. You want me to read it?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So I would be like, &quot;el carro” [the car] and everybody would start</br>   laughing because I can't roll my R's. It's like, a ver di carro, di carro,</br>   di ferrocarril,&quot; [let’s see, say car, say car, say train] (In American</br>   accent) and I can't roll my R's. So, they'll make fun of my accent. And</br>   yeah, the teacher was horrible, and the students were also. In the four</br>   months that I was just in middle school, I saw how a teacher grabbed his</br>   seatbelt and whooped the student [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Oh my God,</br>   this would not happen in the States.&quot; So it's really, really different.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you mentioned right there that there's like the teachers act very</br>   differently.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Can you explain that a little bit more? Do they teach differently too,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I would say they don't even teach you it. They just go to waste</br>   their time on you and get paid off of it. Because in the three months that</br>   I was there, I honestly don't remember learning anything. Like nothing. It</br>   was just like going and wasting my time because I was going for like two</br>   weeks and then this teacher, she -- se fracturó la mano and so le dieron</br>   incapacidad. [she broke her arm and was put on disability]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And they were trying to look for a substitute teacher. So while</br>   they were looking for a substitute teacher, we were like three weeks</br>   without a teacher. So you could imagine kids just coming in and out of the</br>   classroom, throwing stuff. Everybody was doing whatever they wanted. And</br>   then they found a substitute teacher, but the kids were so horrible that</br>   the substitute teacher left crying and didn't come back.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So this other teacher, le decian el padrino, [they called him the</br>   godfather] because literally, era el padrino [he was the godfather] like</br>   everybody there. So, he comes in with like typical macho Mexicano with his</br>   mustache beard, bien cabron. [a right bastard] And he comes in there and</br>   everybody's like, “oh el padrino viene el padrino.” [oh, the godfather, the</br>   godfather’s coming] So like Everybody's like quiet. And one of them, he was</br>   just like, &quot;I don't care, que esto y el otro&quot; [this and that] He was</br>   fucking ... I'm sorry. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He was from one table to another. He was literally like on top of</br>   the tables jumping from one table to another. So el padrino comes in and</br>   he's like, &quot;Get down from there.&quot; And he's like, &quot;No, que esto y el otro.&quot;</br>   He's like, &quot;Get down from there.&quot; &quot;No, I'm not going to get down. What are</br>   you going to do about it?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He takes his belt off and he's like, “One, two, three.” And you</br>   just see him just sit down. Like nothing happened. And then he starts</br>   putting order. Like, &quot;I'm tired of you guys always doing whatever you guys</br>   want, que esto y el otro.&quot; And everybody's like, &quot;Oh my God. Did he just</br>   whoop him?” “Yeah, he did.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So it stayed quiet for a while, but then he left. Then everybody</br>   started making fun of the kid that got whooped by a teacher. And yeah, that</br>   was basically like the most impact made during my middle school experience</br>   here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And then you went to high school after?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I went to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Was that similar to what middle school was?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, nothing. Kids or teenagers were more open minded.

They're</br>   like, &quot;y tienes carnales?” &quot; And I'm like, &quot;carnales, what's that?&quot; &quot;si</br>   tienes hermanos?” And I'm like, &quot;Oh yeah, I have two brothers.&quot; Oh, okay.</br>   And they would use those words, no?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, I started like learning them. “Oh yeah. carnal significa</br>   [carnal means] brother.” What other words did they use? They would use</br>   expressions like, “ay ese hombre es un Don Juan,” [that man is a Don Juan]</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Who's Don Juan?&quot; And they're like, &quot;Oh no. It just means</br>   that he's a player,&quot; and words like that. So I was like, &quot;Oh, okay. This is</br>   like pretty weird, but I like it. It's cool.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So when I was in high school, this kid, he was like the most—I</br>   don't know, he was very hyperactive, but he was cool. He's like, &quot;Hey</br>   Jeimmy,&quot; because everybody was like in break, &quot;Hey Jeimmy.&quot; I'm like,</br>   “que?” He's like, &quot;ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre,&quot; [did you manage to ring</br>   the doorbell] and I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, Jeimmy,</br>   ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre?&quot; and everybody's laughing, and I'm like, “I</br>   don't know what you're talking about.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: &quot;Si Jeimmy si ya tocas el timbre, el timbre de tu casa?.&quot; [have you</br>   rung the doorbell of your house] And I'm like, &quot;mi casa no tiene timbre.”</br>   [my house doesn’t have a doorbell] So everybody just starts laughing at me,</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Oh my God, what did I say?&quot; So later on, I tell my friend,</br>   I'm like, &quot;What did he mean?&quot; And she's laughing at me and she can't stop</br>   laughing at me. And then she's like, &quot;Okay, he basically asked you if</br>   you've already had sex. But your response was, my house doesn't have a</br>   doorbell. So, it's pretty funny.&quot; And I was like, “Oh, okay.”</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So yeah, you start learning all these expressions, all these some</br>   double centered words. And I mean it took me a while to learn it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And coming back, the food is different in Mexico than it is in the US?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="d0bd2cca-242a-423e-ae0e-d56e6e02659a" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges">Jeimmy: Yes.

After that, we</br>   went to Chicago where my mom's brother was at. Then we went to Buffalo, New</br>   York. A couple of years later, we went to Illinois, and Racine, Wisconsin.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you moved around a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: We were migrating very often. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you know why that was?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: My parents were afraid. They would stay at a specific job. Usually,</br>   at first, they started off working in like el campo, which is like land</br>   fields. So it was like picking up apples and peaches, cherries. But</br>   Immigration would be there often. So you would just see like people scream,</br>   &quot;la migra.&quot; And everybody would like run.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, they started looking for other things that weren't as dangerous</br>   as that. So we moved to a different state where mostly the jobs there were</br>   like fabricas.[factories] They stayed there, but then you would notice that</br>   la migra también llegaba a las fábricas, [immigration authorities also went</br>   to factories] So, they started migrating very often. Basically, just</br>   keeping a down low on that and not trying to like be caught by La Migra.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: You started school in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you remember where you started?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Honestly, I don't remember. I remember that every three, four</br>   months, five months, I was always the new girl. I would be changed from</br>   school super often. So I've been to a whole bunch of schools. The only</br>   school I remember that I went three years straight was Shiloh Park</br>   Elementary School. I went there three years straight, which was from third</br>   to sixth grade. But then when I was going to go middle school, we ended up</br>   changing to another city.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And when you started school, if you remember, did you know English?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No. It was really hard for me. I would get mad because I didn't</br>   want to go to school. I didn't understand what the teacher said to me. I</br>   didn't like going to school because I didn't understand anything. Then they</br>   started giving me like, &quot;Okay, you are going to be half your time here and</br>   half your time in a Spanish class.&quot; So that kind of helped me understand.</br>   And then when I was like in second grade, then they're like, &quot;Okay, you're</br>   ready to be in a full English class.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did you feel like people treated you differently when you didn't</br>   really know any English, or?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, actually that school in specific, I felt like there was a lot</br>   of help and they were – nos estaban apoyando mucho. [they helped us a lot.]</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Were there any specific people that you remember that really reached</br>   out and helped you?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes, but I don't even remember their names.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you remember what they did?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I guess there were social teachers, because this lady, she was</br>   bilingual so she would teach me in English and Spanish. So, she would teach</br>   me in English and if I didn't understand, she would just tell me in Spanish</br>   and then showed me what it was or how to say it in English.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And were you able to make friends moving around so frequently?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, there were friends, but it was like, &quot;Oh okay. I have to go</br>   now. Bye.&quot; So I never actually grew up with a best friend.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: How did that make you feel that you are missing out on such an</br>   important part of childhood, having one or a couple of good friends?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, you get used to it. Because here in Mexico, I've been here</br>   for like nine years, and I still don't have like one best friend. So it's</br>   like, &quot;Okay, friends come and go.&quot; I mean, they're always going to be</br>   there, but you're always going to meet new people.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did you finish school in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I got to seventh grade, then when I was 14, my parents decided to</br>   come back to Mexico. So, here, I had to go back to middle school for like</br>   four months and then to high school again.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: You guys came back voluntarily?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And going to school in Mexico when you started?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: It was horrible.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Were people mean to you because you had spent time in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes, but I mean, okay. The first thing I noticed in Mexican school</br>   is that they don't even have toilet paper in the bathrooms. So it's like,</br>   &quot;Okay. Did somebody forget to put toilet paper?&quot; &quot;No, you have to bring</br>   your own.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay, that's so weird.&quot; And then it's like, everybody</br>   would think, I guess it's like they make themselves feel less because they</br>   think that you think that you’re better than them just because you know</br>   English and you were in the States and so on.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So they would be like, &quot;ay la gringa se cree mucho porque viene de</br>   los Estados Unidos y habla inglés.” [the gringa is full of herself because</br>   she’s come from the United States and speaks English] It's like, &quot;No bro,</br>   I'm nothing like that.&quot; So yeah, that was like ignorant children. But then</br>   you'll see that the teachers are just as ignorant because they're like, “Ay</br>   Jeimmy, lee la página tal&quot; [Ay Jeimmy, read this page] I can't read. I</br>   don't know. I can barely speak Spanish. You want me to read it?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So I would be like, &quot;el carro” [the car] and everybody would start</br>   laughing because I can't roll my R's. It's like, a ver di carro, di carro,</br>   di ferrocarril,&quot; [let’s see, say car, say car, say train] (In American</br>   accent) and I can't roll my R's. So, they'll make fun of my accent. And</br>   yeah, the teacher was horrible, and the students were also. In the four</br>   months that I was just in middle school, I saw how a teacher grabbed his</br>   seatbelt and whooped the student [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Oh my God,</br>   this would not happen in the States.&quot; So it's really, really different.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you mentioned right there that there's like the teachers act very</br>   differently.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Can you explain that a little bit more? Do they teach differently too,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I would say they don't even teach you it. They just go to waste</br>   their time on you and get paid off of it. Because in the three months that</br>   I was there, I honestly don't remember learning anything. Like nothing. It</br>   was just like going and wasting my time because I was going for like two</br>   weeks and then this teacher, she -- se fracturó la mano and so le dieron</br>   incapacidad.

[Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He was from one table to another. He was literally like on top of</br>   the tables jumping from one table to another. So el padrino comes in and</br>   he's like, &quot;Get down from there.&quot; And he's like, &quot;No, que esto y el otro.&quot;</br>   He's like, &quot;Get down from there.&quot; &quot;No, I'm not going to get down. What are</br>   you going to do about it?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He takes his belt off and he's like, “One, two, three.” And you</br>   just see him just sit down. Like nothing happened. And then he starts</br>   putting order. Like, &quot;I'm tired of you guys always doing whatever you guys</br>   want, que esto y el otro.&quot; And everybody's like, &quot;Oh my God. Did he just</br>   whoop him?” “Yeah, he did.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So it stayed quiet for a while, but then he left. Then everybody</br>   started making fun of the kid that got whooped by a teacher. And yeah, that</br>   was basically like the most impact made during my middle school experience</br>   here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And then you went to high school after?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I went to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Was that similar to what middle school was?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, nothing. Kids or teenagers were more open minded. Instead of</br>   making fun of me because I knew English, they would be like, &quot;Oh, you know</br>   English. Okay, let's hang out. I can teach you Spanish, you can teach me</br>   English. I can teach you math and you can teach me English.&quot; So they were</br>   more like, &quot;Okay, let's help out each other.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And the teachers, they were all so different. The English teacher</br>   was like, &quot;Oh, okay, you know English. Perfect. Just do one examen [exam]</br>   and whatever you get on that examen, va ser tu calificación para todo el</br>   semestre.&quot; [exam will be your grade for the semester]And I'm like, &quot;Okay,</br>   10, there you go.&quot; A 10 for the whole semester. I didn't have to go to the</br>   classes because the teacher already knew that I knew English.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So she was like, &quot;If you want to be here, to help the other</br>   students, it's fine with me.&quot; So yeah, I would just go whenever I wanted to</br>   and help out the other students, and basically that's it. So my experience</br>   in high school was a lot better. A lot better than middle school.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Besides school when you came back, was it hard to like reintegrate</br>   yourself in Mexican culture after living in the US first for long?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. I think it took me like about two years to integrate into</br>   myself. Because specifically in high school, I started... there's Spanish</br>   and there's Chilango. So, Chilango is way different than Spanish. They're</br>   like, &quot;y tienes carnales?” &quot; And I'm like, &quot;carnales, what's that?&quot; &quot;si</br>   tienes hermanos?” And I'm like, &quot;Oh yeah, I have two brothers.&quot; Oh, okay.</br>   And they would use those words, no?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, I started like learning them. “Oh yeah. carnal significa</br>   [carnal means] brother.” What other words did they use? They would use</br>   expressions like, “ay ese hombre es un Don Juan,” [that man is a Don Juan]</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Who's Don Juan?&quot; And they're like, &quot;Oh no. It just means</br>   that he's a player,&quot; and words like that. So I was like, &quot;Oh, okay. This is</br>   like pretty weird, but I like it. It's cool.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So when I was in high school, this kid, he was like the most—I</br>   don't know, he was very hyperactive, but he was cool. He's like, &quot;Hey</br>   Jeimmy,&quot; because everybody was like in break, &quot;Hey Jeimmy.&quot; I'm like,</br>   “que?” He's like, &quot;ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre,&quot; [did you manage to ring</br>   the doorbell] and I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, Jeimmy,</br>   ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre?&quot; and everybody's laughing, and I'm like, “I</br>   don't know what you're talking about.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: &quot;Si Jeimmy si ya tocas el timbre, el timbre de tu casa?.&quot; [have you</br>   rung the doorbell of your house] And I'm like, &quot;mi casa no tiene timbre.”</br>   [my house doesn’t have a doorbell] So everybody just starts laughing at me,</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Oh my God, what did I say?&quot; So later on, I tell my friend,</br>   I'm like, &quot;What did he mean?&quot; And she's laughing at me and she can't stop</br>   laughing at me. And then she's like, &quot;Okay, he basically asked you if</br>   you've already had sex. But your response was, my house doesn't have a</br>   doorbell. So, it's pretty funny.&quot; And I was like, “Oh, okay.”</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So yeah, you start learning all these expressions, all these some</br>   double centered words. And I mean it took me a while to learn it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And coming back, the food is different in Mexico than it is in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. You know what I hate about Mexican stores? They never fridge</br>   milk. It's like you'd go and ask for a leche, y te dan una leche al tiempo</br>   [milk, and they give you milk at room temperature] It's like, “Bro, why</br>   don't you put it in the fridge. It tastes so good when it's cold.” [Tim</br>   laughs]. Sugar tastes different. Even water tastes different. Everything's</br>   so different.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Are there any like specific American foods that you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: That I miss? Not really. A couple years back, I used to miss like</br>   cranberry sauce, I used to miss gravy, I used to miss candies, like salt</br>   water taffy, like a whole bunch of candies that here in Mexico don't exist.</br>   But then the years pass by and you stop, I don't know, ya no se te antoja,</br>   [you don’t crave it] You're like, &quot;Okay, it's fine.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Okay. So besides the food, is there anything that you miss a lot about</br>   the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I miss the cleanness. It's true that it's greener on the other</br>   side. Everybody can notice that. I miss how you could go to the park and</br>   everything was like, the grass was all green. You would see like—well at</br>   least where I used to live, there was a small pond where you can go throw</br>   bread at ducks. I miss the security that you feel when you call 911 and in</br>   five minutes, the cops are there.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think that's something I really miss a lot, because here, you</br>   could say, &quot;Oh my God, if something happens to me and they call the cops,</br>   they are going to be here like an hour later, and they're not even going to</br>   be here prepared. They're just going to like, nada mas es presencia</br>   [they’re just present] because they're not even prepared for it.&quot; So I</br>   guess that's something that I missed too.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, did you trust the police in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. I always grew up believing that police were good men. Police</br>   are different from ICE. So, La Migra was different from a regular cop. So I</br>   would always trust cops.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And here you don't trust?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, no. No, aqui no. [no, no, here no.] At least I haven't seen a</br>   cop do a good deed. You usually see them like trying to stop people just to</br>   check them and see if they have anything on them.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Is there anything that you don't miss about the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something I don't miss about the States?</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Is there something that you hated about it when you were there?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, no, not really. I enjoyed the time I was there, and they</br>   would tell me, &quot;Do you want to go back?&quot; I would probably say no, but I</br>   mean it was nice.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Why wouldn't you want to go?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Because I feel free here. I have my family here. I might not see a</br>   grass and ponds and so what, but I see my city and el Monumento de la</br>   Revolución , el Angel. I've been to other states like Cancun. Cancun is</br>   beautiful. I would rather be in Cancun than in the States. And you also</br>   make dollars in Cancun. So I mean it's nice.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, do you see yourself as more American or more Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I would say both. [Chuckles]. That was a tough one. Yeah. Both.</br>   Because I mean, I have Mexican blood. You can see me physically and I look</br>   Mexican. But my taste in music isn't that Mexican. My ideal isn't as the</br>   same as a Mexican mind. And well, yeah, I mean you can say I'm like an</br>   Oreo. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What music do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I like electronic music. For example, I like Adela, I like Amy</br>   Winehouse. I love a lot of, well like Charlie Puth, I don't know. I like</br>   that type of music. But I also like not necessarily Mexican, but Latina.</br>   For example, I like Calle Trece. Calle Trece I think is like Puerto Rican</br>   or something like that. I love Calle Trece. What I don't like that's</br>   Mexican, and people criticize me for that, is I don't like Banda. I don't</br>   like Nortenas, I don't like soccer, for example. [Interview laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Right now, this month has been horrible for me. I can't listen. I</br>   can't go on Facebook without seeing memes about soccer. Yeah. So it's</br>   basically that.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you like American sports?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I like football. Yes, I like football. I love it. Because I also</br>   have that. I prefer American men than Mexican men. So if you look at like</br>   ... I mean guys make fun of girls because of this. Girls only see soccer</br>   because they see the guy. But it's true. I mean honestly, it is true. I</br>   like seeing football because I mean it's a savage game where you see men</br>   pushing each other and throwing them against each other, and it's pretty</br>   cool.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But you also see really handsome men. And for me, it's hard to find</br>   a handsome man in Mexico. Don't you agree? [Everyone laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What American football players do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Honestly, I don't know them. I don't. No, let me see if I remember.</br>   When I was in fifth grade, that was when I was like mostly into football</br>   because my teacher, she used to love football. So she's the one that</br>   involved me in all that. I don't remember the player. There was a player</br>   that she loved, and she was like, &quot;Oh my God, he's so cute.&quot; And I started,</br>   I'm like, &quot;Yeah, he is cute.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But honestly, I don't even remember their names. I just know</br>   they're cute. And that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: If you had children, would you raise them in an American way or the</br>   Mexican way, or both?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Both. Because it would be like you would pick the best out of both</br>   sides. For example, in America, if you have garbage, pick it up and take it</br>   with you until you find the garbage can.” And the Mexican version would be</br>   like—how can I say it? I don't know. It's just that my parents raised me</br>   like… I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: American people are more like anti-violence, I guess. Like if your</br>   kid comes to you and they tell you that they're being bullied, you would go</br>   directly to the principal and you would speak with the principal, right? So</br>   it's like, &quot;Okay, my kid's being bullied in your school, what are you going</br>   to do about it?&quot; And the director would try to find a solution or what so</br>   on. And here in Mexico, if you go and tell, &quot;les van haciendo burla a tu</br>   hijo” [they are teasing/picking on your son] he would be like, &quot;Okay, well,</br>   I can't do anything about it. I can’t be just behind your kid all day.&quot; So</br>   what happened here in Mexico would be like, “mira mi amor si te pega,</br>   [listen my love if they hit you] you better whoop their butt. Because if</br>   not, coming home, I'm going to whoop your butt.” So that would be like the</br>   Mexican part. So yeah, I guess I would get like on both sides.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Okay. So now going away from that, because I messed up. [Both laugh].</br>   Are you happy that you spent time in the United States, or do you wish—</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, I'm glad. My life was always like up and down and from left to</br>   right because I never had a stable home, never had a stable school, and</br>   never with stable people. But at the end of the day, that affected me in a</br>   way that right now, as an adult, I can't stay more than two years in one</br>   place. I'm like, &quot;Okay, I need to go. I need to either get a new job or go</br>   live somewhere else.”</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: That's why I've been to Cancun and Veracruz and all these places.</br>   And I'm glad, I mean that. My parents had that dream and followed it. And</br>   they made me part of it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And so, were you happy that they brought you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: At the beginning? I was super happy because I was like, &quot;Oh yes, I</br>   will see my abuelita.&quot; [grandmother] Because in the States, I would always</br>   adopt grandmas. For example, we used to live in this black neighborhood.</br>   So, there was this black lady who I always would call her “Abuelita.” And</br>   she was like, &quot;mi abuelita negra.&quot; It was pretty cool. But after so many</br>   years of not actually seeing your grandma, it's like the best.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Earlier you mentioned like right when you got back, people were mean</br>   to you about how you spoke and things like that. How did it make you feel</br>   at the time that people from your home country, that this was where you</br>   were born, weren't treating you nicely?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, I always thought that knowing English wasn't something bad. I</br>   always considered it like, &quot;Okay, I'm not wrong. You guys are the ones that</br>   are wrong. And I want to see you guys in 10 years and see what you got to</br>   tell me about that.&quot; And yeah, I mean, nine years later, eight years later,</br>   I'm here working at a bilingual call center.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think my life isn't that bad. And I see my middle school people</br>   that were making fun of me, they're like pregnant, mamas luchonas</br> </br> </br>   Tim: But you don't have kids?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Right. [Both laugh]. You would see mamas luchonas, you would see</br>   people ... It's not ningún trabajo es malo [no job is bad]as long as it's a</br>   decent job. But I mean like, why would you make fun of my English? You're</br>   going to end up like that. Right? Time speaks for itself.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: You mentioned a while ago, when you were talking about differences</br>   between US and Mexico, that you think your ideals are American and you</br>   think like an American. Can you speak a little more about that?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: For example, here in Mexico, it's always like, primero yo, después</br>   yo y al ultimo yo. [first me, next me, and last me] So everybody's like, yo</br>   te chingo a ti antes de que tu me chingas a mi. [ I’ll fuck you before you</br>   can fuck me] You can speak to any Mexican and that's basically their</br>   mentality. And I'm not like that. I'm like, &quot;I'll help you, hoy por mi,</br>   manana por ti.” [today from me, tomorrow from you] So I'll help you today</br>   and I expect, or I hope, that you help me tomorrow. So, that's one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something else, I don't know why. This isn’t general, but the</br>   majority of women in Mexico or girls these days, they're 14, 15 years old,</br>   and they're already getting pregnant and having kids when they barely</br>   finished middle school. So it's like everybody looks at me, or at least in</br>   my family, and it's like, &quot;Oh, Jeimmy, why haven't you gotten married yet?&quot;</br>   Like, &quot;I'm 22 years old. I still live with my parents. Why would I get</br>   married?&quot; [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I have like cousins, siblings, that they're 14, 15 years old and</br>   they already had kids. They have a horrible life because they can barely</br>   get a job, they can barely feed their kids. I don't know for what reason.</br>   For them, it was urgent to just get pregnant. So, that's not general, but</br>   at least that's what I've noticed here in Mexico: that the majority of</br>   teenage girls just want to get pregnant as soon as possible.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So do you think your views on getting pregnant and starting a</br>   family were formed by your experiences in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. Because in the States, you see women that are 30 years, and</br>   they're getting married at 30 years.. So, you're like, &quot;Oh, she enjoyed her</br>   teenage years, she enjoyed her life, she already did, and so on, whatever</br>   she wanted to. And now that she's ready, she's going to get married, she's</br>   going to have kids, and everything's going to be perfect.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But here in Mexico, they get pregnant at 16, they leave their kids</br>   with their grandma, and go party and do whatever they wanted to do during</br>   their age. And then it's like the little changes goes on. Then they're like</br>   30 years old, their kids are 15 years old, and they're already like</br>   grandmas. So it's like a little cycle that just goes on and on.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And I have a neighbor that's 32 and she's already a grandma with</br>   four nietos, four grandkids. So, it's like, “Wow.”</br> </br> </br>   Briana: Do you think that in the US there is more of an allowance for</br>   having your life before you start having kids? Do you think there's more</br>   opportunities for that and that's why women don't get pregnant this early?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think it's because when you're a teenager over there, it's like</br>   your parents, they worry on giving you material stuff. In the States, the</br>   government helps you with food vouchers, there's Goodwill, there's</br>   Salvation Army where you can go to the store and buy Levi jeans for a</br>   dollar or two. So it's like the government actually helps you. Like, &quot;If</br>   you're poor, it's fine. We'll help you feed yourself and we'll help you</br>   with clothes. All you have to do is like, I don't know, just put in $20 for</br>   a cell phone.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And here, it's not like that. It's like the government doesn't help</br>   you in anything. So people don't care about a cell phone. They don't care</br>   about a computer. They just want to feed their kids. So these kids just</br>   grow up thinking that they're always limited. They're always limited to not</br>   being able to have this because their parents can't afford it.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, they start getting a boyfriend, their boyfriend buys them</br>   clothes, buys them this, buys them that. They believe that moving in with</br>   their boyfriends at 15 years old is going to remove them from that</br>   poorness, or their boyfriend is going to give them better opportunities</br>   than their parents.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But then they start actually taking a taste of life. Like, &quot;Oh no</br>   sweetie, it's not just this. We got to pay rent, we got to pay food, we got</br>   to pay the baby's diapers.&quot; So at the end, they're worse than if they</br>   would've just stayed with their parents. And I guess a lot of teens take</br>   that decision and make that error because they don't really know what life</br>   is.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, I have another question about school, if it's okay to go back to</br>   that for a second. So when you came back to Mexico, did you know anything</br>   about Mexican history?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Nothing hasta la fecha, [still today] I don't know el himno</br>   nacional, [the national anthem]I don't know who Pancho Villa is, I don't</br>   know who Benito Juarez is, I don't know who Sor Juana is. The only time I</br>   heard about Sor Juana is when my dad was listening to a Nortena song from</br>   Los Tigres del Norte which says something about narcotraficantes [drug</br>   traffickers] and stuff and a mi me dicen Sor Juana a mi me dicen sorpresa.</br>   [they call me Sor Juana, they call me surprise] And they take out their</br>   cuernos de chivo [guns] and start shooting everybody. So that's the only</br>   thing I ever heard about Sor Juana.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   And I come here in Mexico, and they're like, &quot;Oh vas a ir a la</br>   telesecundaria.&quot; [oh you are going to tele - high school] And I'm like,</br>   &quot;Okay, first of all, what's a telesecundaria?&quot; &quot;No, es que allí te enseñan</br>   con pura tele.&quot; So, aqui te ensenan con pura tele, [no, it’s that they</br>   teach you only by TV there] there's no teachers?&quot; &quot; And I'm like, &quot;Okay. So</br>   there’s no teachers? “Si pero, pues las maestras prenden la tele y te</br>   enseñan con la tele.”. [yes, but the teachers turn on the TV and teach you</br>   by TV] And I’m like, so if we learn off of the TV, then how are we like “de</br>   que me sirve tener la maestra allí.” [what’s the point of having a teacher</br>   there?] So, it's like super complicated. It was the worst thing ever.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you mentioned you didn't know the national anthem of Mexico or the</br>   national song. Do you know the pledge of allegiance of the US, the national</br>   anthem of the US? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. I know the pledge of allegiance.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: Did you say it in school?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. For eight years? No, for 12 years? Well I was 12 years in the</br>   States. So I guess like from kindergarten to seventh grade, every day.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you still remember it?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes, but I don't want to sing it. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: [Laughs]. So, let me see. Do you have anything else that you want to</br>   add? I'm still thinking if I have more questions, but I want to give you an</br>   opportunity.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something to add? Well no, not really. [Laughs]. It's just so many</br>   stories I could tell you, but right now I can't think of any.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: You still live with your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What is that like? I know you mentioned that just about everyone else</br>   has moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, it's pretty funny. It's weird I guess because everybody's</br>   independent. But I love living with my parents. I help them pay, because</br>   it's their own house—they don't rent, it's their house. So, it's just like</br>   paying maintenance, paying water, paying the internet. And I get my own</br>   room. I'm comfortable, but I do have occasions where I just want to move</br>   out.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Because, if I ever have a boyfriend—I'm a loner so I've been single</br>   for like two years. [Chuckles]. But if I ever have a boyfriend, it’s going</br>   to be like how am I going to go in my house with my parents and my</br>   boyfriend there? And so, I do have occasions where I do want to be</br>   independent and rent my own place.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did your parents learn English in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: My dad, he understands it and he speaks it. Pero su inglés es un</br>   inglés paisa, like real paisa, [his English is a real paisa English] like</br>   what time is it?, Like, open the dooro or I'll break the window.” (In</br>   Spanish accents) And my mom, she can understand it like 70% and speak it</br>   like 30%. But if I speak to my dad, he'll understand and he'll respond.</br>   Very mocho, but he'll respond.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did they become American too?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. My dad did. My dad here in Mexico, he's very like esos son mis</br>   derechos [these are my rights] very contra-. I don't know. He's always—</br> </br> </br>   Briana: You think it is an American mindset?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. Yes. Because in the States, you're always—I mean, it's not bad</br>   [Laughs]—but you're always complaining about everything. Like, you give me</br>   bad customer service? I'm complaining about it. You gave me this one cent</br>   higher? I'm complaining about it. And it's perfectly fine because that way</br>   you know your human rights. And nobody can come in to ruin it.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: My dad got that mentality, like esta va contra mis derechos, [this</br>   is against my rights] like, &quot;You can't do this.&quot; Or when we had a huge</br>   trouble subscribing my brothers to school because they're American. They</br>   needed like infinity of paperwork. And my dad's like, &quot;Okay. So me estas</br>   diciendo que les estas negando los estudios a mi hijo por esto, esto y lo</br>   otro,” [you are denying my son his studies for this, that and the other]</br>   And they're like, &quot;No, we're not denying him.&quot; -&quot;No entonces?.&quot;[no, so?]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Like, &quot;Okay they would be like esto y lo otro&quot; He's like, &quot;No, no.</br>   Okay. Tell me once again, are you denying my ...&quot; So, he would like se pone</br>   en ese plan, [he’d get like that] and teachers would be like, &quot;Okay. Esta</br>   bien meta a tus hijos.” [it’s fine, enroll your sons]</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, do you think it's really beneficial that he has this mentality?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. Yes, it is.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So your brothers were born in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. I have two brothers that were born in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: What is it like for them having citizenship here as well as US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: For them, it was really hard. I have two brothers. Currently, one</br>   is 19 and the other one is 15. So, nos llevamos todos por [we hadn’t been</br>   together] four years. So my brother, when he came back, it was like… he's</br>   tall and he's like handsome. So Mexican girls weren't used to tall,</br>   handsome guys. Because everybody here's like chaparritos, morenitos.</br>   [small, dark]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: They might be cute, but they're chaparritos and morenitos. So,</br>   everybody was like, &quot;Alexis, Alexis&quot;—because his name is Eduardo Alexis.</br>   But he's like, &quot;I'm going to tell them my name is Alexis.&quot; [Laughs]. So, it</br>   was like, &quot;Oh, Alexis&quot; [High pitched voice]. And his friends, or the other</br>   guys around him, would start getting jealous and they would be like, &quot; que?</br>   te sientes muy chingon, que este y el otro.” [you feel really cool, this</br>   and that]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: This is where the Mexican mentality comes in, where my dad always</br>   taught them, &quot;If you're going to fight with somebody, you better whoop</br>   their butt or else, I'm going to whoop yours.&quot; So my brother was always</br>   like, &quot;You're never going to make me feel less, and we'll fight before you</br>   make me feel less.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, my brother for like two months was fighting at least three</br>   times a week with somebody because they were always like, &quot;te sientes muy</br>   chingon porque eres gringo.&quot; [you feel really cool because you are a</br>   gringo] Like, &quot;Like no no me siento, pero si quieres te lo demuestro.” [no,</br>   I don’t but I if you want I can show you] And he was always like, ganando</br>   territorio, ganando barrio, [gaining territory, gaining neighborhood] I</br>   guess it would be?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He went through a hard time because he was actually having to prove</br>   that he was worth enough to be in the hood with all these people. Because</br>   in Mexico or, well, at least where I live, it’s cerro [mountains (rural)].</br>   So the first generation is our grandparents. Our grandparents first got</br>   there. Then my parents grew up there and they had their kids.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So all these generations have been there for years. When I got to</br>   Mexico, I would see this old lady: &quot;Oh I remember you. You were like two</br>   years old when I met you,&quot; or, they would ask me a lot, “tu de quien eres?”</br>   [whose are you?] and I would be like, &quot;soy hija de Keto” I am Keto’s</br>   daughter] Because they use like—how do you say it—apodos? [nicknames]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, a mi papá le decían el Keto, [my dad was called Keto] So, I</br>   would be like, “soy hija de Keto.” [I am Keto’s daughter] And they're like,</br>   &quot;oh, eres nieta de Emilia.” [you are Emilia’s granddaughter] And I'm like,</br>   yeah. So, that's how they identify like who you are.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: By your family?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: It's basically that. That my brother had to prove to everybody else</br>   that he was worth being there, that he was also Mexican, and that he could</br>   be as good as them for just living there.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So did they view his living in the United States and his being born</br>   in the United States as something negative?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: They see it as something higher than them, and they just can't</br>   accept it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you're happy to be back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Are your parents too?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="9da442be-50f7-4fe1-8d77-77968da752f3" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Parents/step-parents, Economic well-being, Employment,  careers,  welding">Jeimmy: Yeah. My dad, he still has that mentality of wanting to go back.<br>
   And it's because when he left Mexico, he may have a -- una profesion. [a<br>
   profession] He got over there and, like I told you, he was pitching<br>
   peaches, cherries. Then he was working at a fabric. But then, one day, he<br>
   saw a sign that said, &quot;We need welders.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Oh, necesitan<br>
   soldadores, [the need welders] but I don't know how to weld. But I'm going<br>
   to go anyway.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: So, he found the supervisor and he's like, &quot;Oh, you're Mexican,<br>
   huh?&quot; He's like, “Yeah.” &quot;Oh, okay. Well then.&quot; And my dad is like,<br>
   “[Nervous noise].’ It was horrible, but he's like, &quot;Okay, I'm going to show<br>
   you how to weld.&quot; So my dad started learning how to be a welder and became<br>
   an ingeniero industrial. [industrial engineer] So, he knows a lot of things<br>
   that is not very common here in Mexico. He knows how to do it.<br>

   So, there was this black lady who I always would call her “Abuelita.” And<br>

   kid comes to you and they tell you that they're being bullied, you would go<br>
   directly to the principal and you would speak with the principal, right? So<br>
   it's like, &quot;Okay, my kid's being bullied in your school, what are you going<br>
   to do about it?&quot; And the director would try to find a solution or what so<br>
   on. And here in Mexico, if you go and tell, &quot;les van haciendo burla a tu<br>
   hijo” [they are teasing/picking on your son] he would be like, &quot;Okay, well,<br>
   I can't do anything about it. I can’t be just behind your kid all day.&quot; So<br>
   what happened here in Mexico would be like, “mira mi amor si te pega,<br>
   [listen my love if they hit you] you better whoop their butt. Because if<br>
   not, coming home, I'm going to whoop your butt.” So that would be like the<br>
   Mexican part. So yeah, I guess I would get like on both sides.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="e6bc0ab1-b42a-414a-8f74-1695ae4fb66f" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Music">Jeimmy: I like electronic music. For example, I like Adela, I like Amy<br>
   Winehouse. I love a lot of, well like Charlie Puth, I don't know. I like<br>
   that type of music. But I also like not necessarily Mexican, but Latina.<br>
   For example, I like Calle Trece. Calle Trece I think is like Puerto Rican<br>
   or something like that. I love Calle Trece. What I don't like that's<br>
   Mexican, and people criticize me for that, is I don't like Banda. I don't<br>
   like Nortenas, I don't like soccer, for example. [Interview laughs].<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: I would say both. [Chuckles]. That was a tough one. Yeah. Both.<br>
   Because I mean, I have Mexican blood. You can see me physically and I look<br>
   Mexican. But my taste in music isn't that Mexican. My ideal isn't as the<br>
   same as a Mexican mind. And well, yeah, I mean you can say I'm like an<br>
   Oreo. [Laughs].<br>

   could say, &quot;Oh my God, if something happens to me and they call the cops,<br>
   they are going to be here like an hour later, and they're not even going to<br>
   be here prepared. They're just going to like, nada mas es presencia<br>
   [they’re just present] because they're not even prepared for it.&quot; So I<br>
   guess that's something that I missed too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Tim: So, did you trust the police in the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: Yeah. I always grew up believing that police were good men. Police<br>
   are different from ICE. So, La Migra was different from a regular cop. So I<br>
   would always trust cops.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Tim: And here you don't trust?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: No, no. No, aqui no. [no, no, here no.] At least I haven't seen a<br>
   cop do a good deed. You usually see them like trying to stop people just to<br>
   check them and see if they have anything on them.<br>

  </span><span id="63c92ea1-63da-49e7-bc37-84fdf574e6d1" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Favorite">Tim: Are there any like specific American foods that you miss?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: That I miss? Not really. A couple years back, I used to miss like<br>
   cranberry sauce, I used to miss gravy, I used to miss candies, like salt<br>
   water taffy, like a whole bunch of candies that here in Mexico don't exist.<br>
   But then the years pass by and you stop, I don't know, ya no se te antoja,<br>
   [you don’t crave it] You're like, &quot;Okay, it's fine.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Tim: Okay. So besides the food, is there anything that you miss a lot about<br>
   the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: I miss the cleanness. It's true that it's greener on the other<br>
   side. Everybody can notice that. I miss how you could go to the park and<br>
   everything was like, the grass was all green. You would see like—well at<br>
   least where I used to live, there was a small pond where you can go throw<br>
   bread at ducks. I miss the security that you feel when you call 911 and in<br>
   five minutes, the cops are there.<br>

   yourself in Mexican culture after living in the US first for long?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: Yes. I think it took me like about two years to integrate into<br>
   myself. Because specifically in high school, I started... there's Spanish<br>
   and there's Chilango. So, Chilango is way different than Spanish. They're<br>
   like, &quot;y tienes carnales?” &quot; And I'm like, &quot;carnales, what's that?&quot; &quot;si<br>
   tienes hermanos?” And I'm like, &quot;Oh yeah, I have two brothers.&quot; Oh, okay.<br>
   And they would use those words, no?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: So, I started like learning them. “Oh yeah. carnal significa<br>
   [carnal means] brother.” What other words did they use? They would use<br>
   expressions like, “ay ese hombre es un Don Juan,” [that man is a Don Juan]<br>
   and I'm like, &quot;Who's Don Juan?&quot; And they're like, &quot;Oh no. It just means<br>
   that he's a player,&quot; and words like that. So I was like, &quot;Oh, okay. This is<br>
   like pretty weird, but I like it. It's cool.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: So when I was in high school, this kid, he was like the most—I<br>
   don't know, he was very hyperactive, but he was cool. He's like, &quot;Hey<br>
   Jeimmy,&quot; because everybody was like in break, &quot;Hey Jeimmy.&quot; I'm like,<br>
   “que?” He's like, &quot;ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre,&quot; [did you manage to ring<br>
   the doorbell] and I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, Jeimmy,<br>
   ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre?&quot; and everybody's laughing, and I'm like, “I<br>
   don't know what you're talking about.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: &quot;Si Jeimmy si ya tocas el timbre, el timbre de tu casa?.&quot; [have you<br>
   rung the doorbell of your house] And I'm like, &quot;mi casa no tiene timbre.”<br>
   [my house doesn’t have a doorbell] So everybody just starts laughing at me,<br>
   and I'm like, &quot;Oh my God, what did I say?&quot; So later on, I tell my friend,<br>
   I'm like, &quot;What did he mean?&quot; And she's laughing at me and she can't stop<br>
   laughing at me. And then she's like, &quot;Okay, he basically asked you if<br>
   you've already had sex. But your response was, my house doesn't have a<br>
   doorbell. So, it's pretty funny.&quot; And I was like, “Oh, okay.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: So yeah, you start learning all these expressions, all these some<br>
   double centered words. And I mean it took me a while to learn it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: Yes, but I mean, okay. The first thing I noticed in Mexican school<br>
   is that they don't even have toilet paper in the bathrooms. So it's like,<br>
   &quot;Okay. Did somebody forget to put toilet paper?&quot; &quot;No, you have to bring<br>
   your own.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Okay, that's so weird.&quot; And then it's like, everybody<br>
   would think, I guess it's like they make themselves feel less because they<br>
   think that you think that you’re better than them just because you know<br>
   English and you were in the States and so on.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: So they would be like, &quot;ay la gringa se cree mucho porque viene de<br>
   los Estados Unidos y habla inglés.” [the gringa is full of herself because<br>
   she’s come from the United States and speaks English] It's like, &quot;No bro,<br>
   I'm nothing like that.&quot; So yeah, that was like ignorant children. But then<br>
   you'll see that the teachers are just as ignorant because they're like, “Ay<br>
   Jeimmy, lee la página tal&quot; [Ay Jeimmy, read this page] I can't read. I<br>
   don't know. I can barely speak Spanish. You want me to read it?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jeimmy: So I would be like, &quot;el carro” [the car] and everybody would start<br>
   laughing because I can't roll my R's. It's like, a ver di carro, di carro,<br>
   di ferrocarril,&quot; [let’s see, say car, say car, say train] (In American<br>
   accent) and I can't roll my R's. So, they'll make fun of my accent. And<br>
   yeah, the teacher was horrible, and the students were also. In the four<br>
   months that I was just in middle school, I saw how a teacher grabbed his<br>
   seatbelt and whooped the student [Chuckles]. So, I was like, &quot;Oh my God,<br>
   this would not happen in the States.&quot; So it's really, really different.<br>

   didn't like going to school because I didn't understand anything. Then they<br>
   started giving me like, &quot;Okay, you are going to be half your time here and<br>
   half your time in a Spanish class.&quot; So that kind of helped me understand.<br>

   school I remember that I went three years straight was Shiloh Park<br>
   Elementary School. I went there three years straight, which was from third<br>
   to sixth grade. But then when I was going to go middle school, we ended up<br>
   changing to another city.<br>

So, she would teach</br>   me in English and if I didn't understand, she would just tell me in Spanish</br>   and then showed me what it was or how to say it in English.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And were you able to make friends moving around so frequently?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, there were friends, but it was like, &quot;Oh okay. I have to go</br>   now.

Because here in Mexico, I've been here</br>   for like nine years, and I still don't have like one best friend. So it's</br>   like, &quot;Okay, friends come and go.&quot; I mean, they're always going to be</br>   there, but you're always going to meet new people.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did you finish school in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I got to seventh grade, then when I was 14, my parents decided to</br>   come back to Mexico.

So, I was like, &quot;Oh my God,</br>   this would not happen in the States.&quot; So it's really, really different.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you mentioned right there that there's like the teachers act very</br>   differently.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Can you explain that a little bit more? Do they teach differently too,</br>   or?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I would say they don't even teach you it. They just go to waste</br>   their time on you and get paid off of it. Because in the three months that</br>   I was there, I honestly don't remember learning anything. Like nothing. It</br>   was just like going and wasting my time because I was going for like two</br>   weeks and then this teacher, she -- se fracturó la mano and so le dieron</br>   incapacidad. [she broke her arm and was put on disability]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And they were trying to look for a substitute teacher. So while</br>   they were looking for a substitute teacher, we were like three weeks</br>   without a teacher. So you could imagine kids just coming in and out of the</br>   classroom, throwing stuff. Everybody was doing whatever they wanted. And</br>   then they found a substitute teacher, but the kids were so horrible that</br>   the substitute teacher left crying and didn't come back.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So this other teacher, le decian el padrino, [they called him the</br>   godfather] because literally, era el padrino [he was the godfather] like</br>   everybody there. So, he comes in with like typical macho Mexicano with his</br>   mustache beard, bien cabron. [a right bastard] And he comes in there and</br>   everybody's like, “oh el padrino viene el padrino.” [oh, the godfather, the</br>   godfather’s coming] So like Everybody's like quiet. And one of them, he was</br>   just like, &quot;I don't care, que esto y el otro&quot; [this and that] He was</br>   fucking ... I'm sorry. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He was from one table to another. He was literally like on top of</br>   the tables jumping from one table to another. So el padrino comes in and</br>   he's like, &quot;Get down from there.&quot; And he's like, &quot;No, que esto y el otro.&quot;</br>   He's like, &quot;Get down from there.&quot; &quot;No, I'm not going to get down. What are</br>   you going to do about it?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He takes his belt off and he's like, “One, two, three.” And you</br>   just see him just sit down. Like nothing happened. And then he starts</br>   putting order. Like, &quot;I'm tired of you guys always doing whatever you guys</br>   want, que esto y el otro.&quot; And everybody's like, &quot;Oh my God. Did he just</br>   whoop him?” “Yeah, he did.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So it stayed quiet for a while, but then he left. Then everybody</br>   started making fun of the kid that got whooped by a teacher. And yeah, that</br>   was basically like the most impact made during my middle school experience</br>   here in Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And then you went to high school after?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I went to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Was that similar to what middle school was?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, nothing. Kids or teenagers were more open minded. Instead of</br>   making fun of me because I knew English, they would be like, &quot;Oh, you know</br>   English. Okay, let's hang out. I can teach you Spanish, you can teach me</br>   English. I can teach you math and you can teach me English.&quot; So they were</br>   more like, &quot;Okay, let's help out each other.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And the teachers, they were all so different. The English teacher</br>   was like, &quot;Oh, okay, you know English. Perfect. Just do one examen [exam]</br>   and whatever you get on that examen, va ser tu calificación para todo el</br>   semestre.&quot; [exam will be your grade for the semester]And I'm like, &quot;Okay,</br>   10, there you go.&quot; A 10 for the whole semester. I didn't have to go to the</br>   classes because the teacher already knew that I knew English.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So she was like, &quot;If you want to be here, to help the other</br>   students, it's fine with me.&quot; So yeah, I would just go whenever I wanted to</br>   and help out the other students, and basically that's it. So my experience</br>   in high school was a lot better. A lot better than middle school.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Besides school when you came back, was it hard to like reintegrate</br>   yourself in Mexican culture after living in the US first for long?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes.

They would use</br>   expressions like, “ay ese hombre es un Don Juan,” [that man is a Don Juan]</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Who's Don Juan?&quot; And they're like, &quot;Oh no. It just means</br>   that he's a player,&quot; and words like that. So I was like, &quot;Oh, okay. This is</br>   like pretty weird, but I like it. It's cool.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So when I was in high school, this kid, he was like the most—I</br>   don't know, he was very hyperactive, but he was cool. He's like, &quot;Hey</br>   Jeimmy,&quot; because everybody was like in break, &quot;Hey Jeimmy.&quot; I'm like,</br>   “que?” He's like, &quot;ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre,&quot; [did you manage to ring</br>   the doorbell] and I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, Jeimmy,</br>   ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre?&quot; and everybody's laughing, and I'm like, “I</br>   don't know what you're talking about.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: &quot;Si Jeimmy si ya tocas el timbre, el timbre de tu casa?.&quot; [have you</br>   rung the doorbell of your house] And I'm like, &quot;mi casa no tiene timbre.”</br>   [my house doesn’t have a doorbell] So everybody just starts laughing at me,</br>   and I'm like, &quot;Oh my God, what did I say?&quot; So later on, I tell my friend,</br>   I'm like, &quot;What did he mean?&quot; And she's laughing at me and she can't stop</br>   laughing at me. And then she's like, &quot;Okay, he basically asked you if</br>   you've already had sex. But your response was, my house doesn't have a</br>   doorbell. So, it's pretty funny.&quot; And I was like, “Oh, okay.”</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So yeah, you start learning all these expressions, all these some</br>   double centered words. And I mean it took me a while to learn it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And coming back, the food is different in Mexico than it is in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. You know what I hate about Mexican stores? They never fridge</br>   milk. It's like you'd go and ask for a leche, y te dan una leche al tiempo</br>   [milk, and they give you milk at room temperature] It's like, “Bro, why</br>   don't you put it in the fridge. It tastes so good when it's cold.” [Tim</br>   laughs]. Sugar tastes different. Even water tastes different. Everything's</br>   so different.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Are there any like specific American foods that you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: That I miss? Not really. A couple years back, I used to miss like</br>   cranberry sauce, I used to miss gravy, I used to miss candies, like salt</br>   water taffy, like a whole bunch of candies that here in Mexico don't exist.</br>   But then the years pass by and you stop, I don't know, ya no se te antoja,</br>   [you don’t crave it] You're like, &quot;Okay, it's fine.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Okay. So besides the food, is there anything that you miss a lot about</br>   the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I miss the cleanness. It's true that it's greener on the other</br>   side. Everybody can notice that. I miss how you could go to the park and</br>   everything was like, the grass was all green. You would see like—well at</br>   least where I used to live, there was a small pond where you can go throw</br>   bread at ducks. I miss the security that you feel when you call 911 and in</br>   five minutes, the cops are there.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think that's something I really miss a lot, because here, you</br>   could say, &quot;Oh my God, if something happens to me and they call the cops,</br>   they are going to be here like an hour later, and they're not even going to</br>   be here prepared. They're just going to like, nada mas es presencia</br>   [they’re just present] because they're not even prepared for it.&quot; So I</br>   guess that's something that I missed too.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, did you trust the police in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. I always grew up believing that police were good men. Police</br>   are different from ICE. So, La Migra was different from a regular cop. So I</br>   would always trust cops.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And here you don't trust?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, no. No, aqui no. [no, no, here no.] At least I haven't seen a</br>   cop do a good deed. You usually see them like trying to stop people just to</br>   check them and see if they have anything on them.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Is there anything that you don't miss about the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something I don't miss about the States?</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Is there something that you hated about it when you were there?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, no, not really. I enjoyed the time I was there, and they</br>   would tell me, &quot;Do you want to go back?&quot; I would probably say no, but I</br>   mean it was nice.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Why wouldn't you want to go?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Because I feel free here. I have my family here. I might not see a</br>   grass and ponds and so what, but I see my city and el Monumento de la</br>   Revolución , el Angel. I've been to other states like Cancun. Cancun is</br>   beautiful. I would rather be in Cancun than in the States. And you also</br>   make dollars in Cancun. So I mean it's nice.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, do you see yourself as more American or more Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I would say both. [Chuckles]. That was a tough one. Yeah. Both.</br>   Because I mean, I have Mexican blood. You can see me physically and I look</br>   Mexican. But my taste in music isn't that Mexican. My ideal isn't as the</br>   same as a Mexican mind. And well, yeah, I mean you can say I'm like an</br>   Oreo. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What music do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I like electronic music. For example, I like Adela, I like Amy</br>   Winehouse. I love a lot of, well like Charlie Puth, I don't know. I like</br>   that type of music. But I also like not necessarily Mexican, but Latina.</br>   For example, I like Calle Trece. Calle Trece I think is like Puerto Rican</br>   or something like that. I love Calle Trece. What I don't like that's</br>   Mexican, and people criticize me for that, is I don't like Banda. I don't</br>   like Nortenas, I don't like soccer, for example. [Interview laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Right now, this month has been horrible for me. I can't listen. I</br>   can't go on Facebook without seeing memes about soccer. Yeah. So it's</br>   basically that.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you like American sports?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I like football. Yes, I like football. I love it. Because I also</br>   have that. I prefer American men than Mexican men. So if you look at like</br>   ... I mean guys make fun of girls because of this. Girls only see soccer</br>   because they see the guy. But it's true. I mean honestly, it is true. I</br>   like seeing football because I mean it's a savage game where you see men</br>   pushing each other and throwing them against each other, and it's pretty</br>   cool.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But you also see really handsome men. And for me, it's hard to find</br>   a handsome man in Mexico. Don't you agree? [Everyone laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What American football players do you like?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Honestly, I don't know them. I don't. No, let me see if I remember.</br>   When I was in fifth grade, that was when I was like mostly into football</br>   because my teacher, she used to love football. So she's the one that</br>   involved me in all that. I don't remember the player. There was a player</br>   that she loved, and she was like, &quot;Oh my God, he's so cute.&quot; And I started,</br>   I'm like, &quot;Yeah, he is cute.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But honestly, I don't even remember their names. I just know</br>   they're cute. And that's it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: If you had children, would you raise them in an American way or the</br>   Mexican way, or both?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Both. Because it would be like you would pick the best out of both</br>   sides. For example, in America, if you have garbage, pick it up and take it</br>   with you until you find the garbage can.” And the Mexican version would be</br>   like—how can I say it? I don't know. It's just that my parents raised me</br>   like… I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: American people are more like anti-violence, I guess. Like if your</br>   kid comes to you and they tell you that they're being bullied, you would go</br>   directly to the principal and you would speak with the principal, right? So</br>   it's like, &quot;Okay, my kid's being bullied in your school, what are you going</br>   to do about it?&quot; And the director would try to find a solution or what so</br>   on. And here in Mexico, if you go and tell, &quot;les van haciendo burla a tu</br>   hijo” [they are teasing/picking on your son] he would be like, &quot;Okay, well,</br>   I can't do anything about it. I can’t be just behind your kid all day.&quot; So</br>   what happened here in Mexico would be like, “mira mi amor si te pega,</br>   [listen my love if they hit you] you better whoop their butt. Because if</br>   not, coming home, I'm going to whoop your butt.” So that would be like the</br>   Mexican part. So yeah, I guess I would get like on both sides.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Okay. So now going away from that, because I messed up. [Both laugh].</br>   Are you happy that you spent time in the United States, or do you wish—</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: No, I'm glad. My life was always like up and down and from left to</br>   right because I never had a stable home, never had a stable school, and</br>   never with stable people. But at the end of the day, that affected me in a</br>   way that right now, as an adult, I can't stay more than two years in one</br>   place. I'm like, &quot;Okay, I need to go. I need to either get a new job or go</br>   live somewhere else.”</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: That's why I've been to Cancun and Veracruz and all these places.</br>   And I'm glad, I mean that. My parents had that dream and followed it. And</br>   they made me part of it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: And so, were you happy that they brought you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: At the beginning? I was super happy because I was like, &quot;Oh yes, I</br>   will see my abuelita.&quot; [grandmother] Because in the States, I would always</br>   adopt grandmas. For example, we used to live in this black neighborhood.</br>   So, there was this black lady who I always would call her “Abuelita.” And</br>   she was like, &quot;mi abuelita negra.&quot; It was pretty cool. But after so many</br>   years of not actually seeing your grandma, it's like the best.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Earlier you mentioned like right when you got back, people were mean</br>   to you about how you spoke and things like that. How did it make you feel</br>   at the time that people from your home country, that this was where you</br>   were born, weren't treating you nicely?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, I always thought that knowing English wasn't something bad. I</br>   always considered it like, &quot;Okay, I'm not wrong. You guys are the ones that</br>   are wrong. And I want to see you guys in 10 years and see what you got to</br>   tell me about that.&quot; And yeah, I mean, nine years later, eight years later,</br>   I'm here working at a bilingual call center.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think my life isn't that bad. And I see my middle school people</br>   that were making fun of me, they're like pregnant, mamas luchonas</br> </br> </br>   Tim: But you don't have kids?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Right. [Both laugh]. You would see mamas luchonas, you would see</br>   people ... It's not ningún trabajo es malo [no job is bad]as long as it's a</br>   decent job. But I mean like, why would you make fun of my English? You're</br>   going to end up like that. Right? Time speaks for itself.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: You mentioned a while ago, when you were talking about differences</br>   between US and Mexico, that you think your ideals are American and you</br>   think like an American. Can you speak a little more about that?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: For example, here in Mexico, it's always like, primero yo, después</br>   yo y al ultimo yo. [first me, next me, and last me] So everybody's like, yo</br>   te chingo a ti antes de que tu me chingas a mi. [ I’ll fuck you before you</br>   can fuck me] You can speak to any Mexican and that's basically their</br>   mentality. And I'm not like that. I'm like, &quot;I'll help you, hoy por mi,</br>   manana por ti.” [today from me, tomorrow from you] So I'll help you today</br>   and I expect, or I hope, that you help me tomorrow. So, that's one thing.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something else, I don't know why. This isn’t general, but the</br>   majority of women in Mexico or girls these days, they're 14, 15 years old,</br>   and they're already getting pregnant and having kids when they barely</br>   finished middle school. So it's like everybody looks at me, or at least in</br>   my family, and it's like, &quot;Oh, Jeimmy, why haven't you gotten married yet?&quot;</br>   Like, &quot;I'm 22 years old. I still live with my parents. Why would I get</br>   married?&quot; [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I have like cousins, siblings, that they're 14, 15 years old and</br>   they already had kids. They have a horrible life because they can barely</br>   get a job, they can barely feed their kids. I don't know for what reason.</br>   For them, it was urgent to just get pregnant. So, that's not general, but</br>   at least that's what I've noticed here in Mexico: that the majority of</br>   teenage girls just want to get pregnant as soon as possible.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So do you think your views on getting pregnant and starting a</br>   family were formed by your experiences in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. Because in the States, you see women that are 30 years, and</br>   they're getting married at 30 years.. So, you're like, &quot;Oh, she enjoyed her</br>   teenage years, she enjoyed her life, she already did, and so on, whatever</br>   she wanted to. And now that she's ready, she's going to get married, she's</br>   going to have kids, and everything's going to be perfect.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But here in Mexico, they get pregnant at 16, they leave their kids</br>   with their grandma, and go party and do whatever they wanted to do during</br>   their age. And then it's like the little changes goes on. Then they're like</br>   30 years old, their kids are 15 years old, and they're already like</br>   grandmas. So it's like a little cycle that just goes on and on.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And I have a neighbor that's 32 and she's already a grandma with</br>   four nietos, four grandkids. So, it's like, “Wow.”</br> </br> </br>   Briana: Do you think that in the US there is more of an allowance for</br>   having your life before you start having kids? Do you think there's more</br>   opportunities for that and that's why women don't get pregnant this early?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: I think it's because when you're a teenager over there, it's like</br>   your parents, they worry on giving you material stuff. In the States, the</br>   government helps you with food vouchers, there's Goodwill, there's</br>   Salvation Army where you can go to the store and buy Levi jeans for a</br>   dollar or two. So it's like the government actually helps you. Like, &quot;If</br>   you're poor, it's fine. We'll help you feed yourself and we'll help you</br>   with clothes. All you have to do is like, I don't know, just put in $20 for</br>   a cell phone.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: And here, it's not like that. It's like the government doesn't help</br>   you in anything. So people don't care about a cell phone. They don't care</br>   about a computer. They just want to feed their kids. So these kids just</br>   grow up thinking that they're always limited. They're always limited to not</br>   being able to have this because their parents can't afford it.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, they start getting a boyfriend, their boyfriend buys them</br>   clothes, buys them this, buys them that. They believe that moving in with</br>   their boyfriends at 15 years old is going to remove them from that</br>   poorness, or their boyfriend is going to give them better opportunities</br>   than their parents.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: But then they start actually taking a taste of life. Like, &quot;Oh no</br>   sweetie, it's not just this. We got to pay rent, we got to pay food, we got</br>   to pay the baby's diapers.&quot; So at the end, they're worse than if they</br>   would've just stayed with their parents. And I guess a lot of teens take</br>   that decision and make that error because they don't really know what life</br>   is.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, I have another question about school, if it's okay to go back to</br>   that for a second. So when you came back to Mexico, did you know anything</br>   about Mexican history?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Nothing hasta la fecha, [still today] I don't know el himno</br>   nacional, [the national anthem]I don't know who Pancho Villa is, I don't</br>   know who Benito Juarez is, I don't know who Sor Juana is. The only time I</br>   heard about Sor Juana is when my dad was listening to a Nortena song from</br>   Los Tigres del Norte which says something about narcotraficantes [drug</br>   traffickers] and stuff and a mi me dicen Sor Juana a mi me dicen sorpresa.</br>   [they call me Sor Juana, they call me surprise] And they take out their</br>   cuernos de chivo [guns] and start shooting everybody. So that's the only</br>   thing I ever heard about Sor Juana.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   And I come here in Mexico, and they're like, &quot;Oh vas a ir a la</br>   telesecundaria.&quot; [oh you are going to tele - high school] And I'm like,</br>   &quot;Okay, first of all, what's a telesecundaria?&quot; &quot;No, es que allí te enseñan</br>   con pura tele.&quot; So, aqui te ensenan con pura tele, [no, it’s that they</br>   teach you only by TV there] there's no teachers?&quot; &quot; And I'm like, &quot;Okay. So</br>   there’s no teachers? “Si pero, pues las maestras prenden la tele y te</br>   enseñan con la tele.”. [yes, but the teachers turn on the TV and teach you</br>   by TV] And I’m like, so if we learn off of the TV, then how are we like “de</br>   que me sirve tener la maestra allí.” [what’s the point of having a teacher</br>   there?] So, it's like super complicated. It was the worst thing ever.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you mentioned you didn't know the national anthem of Mexico or the</br>   national song. Do you know the pledge of allegiance of the US, the national</br>   anthem of the US? [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. I know the pledge of allegiance.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: Did you say it in school?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. For eight years? No, for 12 years? Well I was 12 years in the</br>   States. So I guess like from kindergarten to seventh grade, every day.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Do you still remember it?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes, but I don't want to sing it. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Tim: [Laughs]. So, let me see. Do you have anything else that you want to</br>   add? I'm still thinking if I have more questions, but I want to give you an</br>   opportunity.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Something to add? Well no, not really. [Laughs]. It's just so many</br>   stories I could tell you, but right now I can't think of any.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: You still live with your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: What is that like? I know you mentioned that just about everyone else</br>   has moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Well, it's pretty funny. It's weird I guess because everybody's</br>   independent. But I love living with my parents. I help them pay, because</br>   it's their own house—they don't rent, it's their house. So, it's just like</br>   paying maintenance, paying water, paying the internet. And I get my own</br>   room. I'm comfortable, but I do have occasions where I just want to move</br>   out.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Because, if I ever have a boyfriend—I'm a loner so I've been single</br>   for like two years. [Chuckles]. But if I ever have a boyfriend, it’s going</br>   to be like how am I going to go in my house with my parents and my</br>   boyfriend there? And so, I do have occasions where I do want to be</br>   independent and rent my own place.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did your parents learn English in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: My dad, he understands it and he speaks it. Pero su inglés es un</br>   inglés paisa, like real paisa, [his English is a real paisa English] like</br>   what time is it?, Like, open the dooro or I'll break the window.” (In</br>   Spanish accents) And my mom, she can understand it like 70% and speak it</br>   like 30%. But if I speak to my dad, he'll understand and he'll respond.</br>   Very mocho, but he'll respond.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Did they become American too?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. My dad did. My dad here in Mexico, he's very like esos son mis</br>   derechos [these are my rights] very contra-. I don't know. He's always—</br> </br> </br>   Briana: You think it is an American mindset?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. Yes. Because in the States, you're always—I mean, it's not bad</br>   [Laughs]—but you're always complaining about everything. Like, you give me</br>   bad customer service? I'm complaining about it. You gave me this one cent</br>   higher? I'm complaining about it. And it's perfectly fine because that way</br>   you know your human rights. And nobody can come in to ruin it.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: My dad got that mentality, like esta va contra mis derechos, [this</br>   is against my rights] like, &quot;You can't do this.&quot; Or when we had a huge</br>   trouble subscribing my brothers to school because they're American. They</br>   needed like infinity of paperwork. And my dad's like, &quot;Okay. So me estas</br>   diciendo que les estas negando los estudios a mi hijo por esto, esto y lo</br>   otro,” [you are denying my son his studies for this, that and the other]</br>   And they're like, &quot;No, we're not denying him.&quot; -&quot;No entonces?.&quot;[no, so?]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Like, &quot;Okay they would be like esto y lo otro&quot; He's like, &quot;No, no.</br>   Okay. Tell me once again, are you denying my ...&quot; So, he would like se pone</br>   en ese plan, [he’d get like that] and teachers would be like, &quot;Okay. Esta</br>   bien meta a tus hijos.” [it’s fine, enroll your sons]</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, do you think it's really beneficial that he has this mentality?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. Yes, it is.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So your brothers were born in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. I have two brothers that were born in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: What is it like for them having citizenship here as well as US?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: For them, it was really hard. I have two brothers. Currently, one</br>   is 19 and the other one is 15. So, nos llevamos todos por [we hadn’t been</br>   together] four years. So my brother, when he came back, it was like… he's</br>   tall and he's like handsome. So Mexican girls weren't used to tall,</br>   handsome guys. Because everybody here's like chaparritos, morenitos.</br>   [small, dark]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: They might be cute, but they're chaparritos and morenitos. So,</br>   everybody was like, &quot;Alexis, Alexis&quot;—because his name is Eduardo Alexis.</br>   But he's like, &quot;I'm going to tell them my name is Alexis.&quot; [Laughs]. So, it</br>   was like, &quot;Oh, Alexis&quot; [High pitched voice]. And his friends, or the other</br>   guys around him, would start getting jealous and they would be like, &quot; que?</br>   te sientes muy chingon, que este y el otro.” [you feel really cool, this</br>   and that]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: This is where the Mexican mentality comes in, where my dad always</br>   taught them, &quot;If you're going to fight with somebody, you better whoop</br>   their butt or else, I'm going to whoop yours.&quot; So my brother was always</br>   like, &quot;You're never going to make me feel less, and we'll fight before you</br>   make me feel less.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, my brother for like two months was fighting at least three</br>   times a week with somebody because they were always like, &quot;te sientes muy</br>   chingon porque eres gringo.&quot; [you feel really cool because you are a</br>   gringo] Like, &quot;Like no no me siento, pero si quieres te lo demuestro.” [no,</br>   I don’t but I if you want I can show you] And he was always like, ganando</br>   territorio, ganando barrio, [gaining territory, gaining neighborhood] I</br>   guess it would be?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: He went through a hard time because he was actually having to prove</br>   that he was worth enough to be in the hood with all these people. Because</br>   in Mexico or, well, at least where I live, it’s cerro [mountains (rural)].</br>   So the first generation is our grandparents. Our grandparents first got</br>   there. Then my parents grew up there and they had their kids.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So all these generations have been there for years. When I got to</br>   Mexico, I would see this old lady: &quot;Oh I remember you. You were like two</br>   years old when I met you,&quot; or, they would ask me a lot, “tu de quien eres?”</br>   [whose are you?] and I would be like, &quot;soy hija de Keto” I am Keto’s</br>   daughter] Because they use like—how do you say it—apodos? [nicknames]</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, a mi papá le decían el Keto, [my dad was called Keto] So, I</br>   would be like, “soy hija de Keto.” [I am Keto’s daughter] And they're like,</br>   &quot;oh, eres nieta de Emilia.” [you are Emilia’s granddaughter] And I'm like,</br>   yeah. So, that's how they identify like who you are.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: By your family?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: It's basically that. That my brother had to prove to everybody else</br>   that he was worth being there, that he was also Mexican, and that he could</br>   be as good as them for just living there.</br> </br> </br>   Briana: So did they view his living in the United States and his being born</br>   in the United States as something negative?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: They see it as something higher than them, and they just can't</br>   accept it.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: So, you're happy to be back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Are your parents too?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yeah. My dad, he still has that mentality of wanting to go back.</br>   And it's because when he left Mexico, he may have a -- una profesion. [a</br>   profession] He got over there and, like I told you, he was pitching</br>   peaches, cherries. Then he was working at a fabric. But then, one day, he</br>   saw a sign that said, &quot;We need welders.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Oh, necesitan</br>   soldadores, [the need welders] but I don't know how to weld. But I'm going</br>   to go anyway.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, he found the supervisor and he's like, &quot;Oh, you're Mexican,</br>   huh?&quot; He's like, “Yeah.” &quot;Oh, okay. Well then.&quot; And my dad is like,</br>   “[Nervous noise].’ It was horrible, but he's like, &quot;Okay, I'm going to show</br>   you how to weld.&quot; So my dad started learning how to be a welder and became</br>   an ingeniero industrial. [industrial engineer] So, he knows a lot of things</br>   that is not very common here in Mexico. He knows how to do it.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, he would start looking for jobs where he said, “If I weld this,</br>   just to do it, because this whole thing costs like 10,000 pesos, they're</br>   already like, ‘I'm getting paid, I don't know, 3000 for it. Y nada mas’”</br>   Like 10 minutes of doing it, the company was already getting paid thousands</br>   of pesos for it. And he was only getting paid like 1,000 and change a week.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So, he's like, &quot;I'm working for this company that's making</br>   thousands of pesos, y a mi nada mas me pagan 1000 pesos a la semana. &quot;</br>   [they are only paying me 1000 pesos a week] So he didn't like that. He's</br>   like, &quot;They're not paying me enough for what I know how to do.&quot; So he</br>   started looking for more and more jobs, and he started noticing that jobs</br>   that have nothing to do what he does pay more than what he actually knows</br>   how to do.</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: So he became like chofer de metrobus,[bus driver] he became like</br>   taxista, [taxi driver] and he's like, &quot;I don't like this. I don't like</br>   being a chofer. [driver] I want to do what I like doing. But it's not paid</br>   well here, so I want to go back to the States and work over there.&quot; So</br>   yeah, that's basically why he wants to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: If your parents do go back, do you think you might or you—</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Oh no. We had that conversation before. I told them, &quot;Yo me quedo</br>   aquí en la casa. [I am staying here, in the house] You guys can send me</br>   money and I'll like yo construyo la casa [I’ll build the house] but I'm</br>   staying here.&quot; Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Tim: Your brothers who are both American citizens have they considered</br>   going back or do they?</br> </br> </br>   Jeimmy: Yes. My 19 -year old brother, I don't know why he hasn't left yet.</br>   He would have already left. But I guess he doesn't want to, I don't know.</br>   And my 15- year old brother, he's like indeciso. [undecided] Because he was</br>   like five years old when we came back. So he forgot English. He understands</br>   it, but he doesn't speak it well. So he's like, &quot;If I do go back, I want to</br>   go back with someone because I don't know much English.&quot; So yeah, he's</br>   still in a dilemma.</br> </div><\p></p>
