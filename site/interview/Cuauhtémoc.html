        <div class="content">
            <p><p><br>
   Claudia: My first question is how old were you when you went to the United<br>
   States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Six years old approximately. Now, the reason why I say<br>
   approximately is due to the fact that I don't remember a precise date, it's<br>
   a little bit cloudy for me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And how did you end up in the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: So initially my father was murdered cold-bloodily right before<br>
   my second birthday. His death occurred on April 2nd, 1992. I was born on<br>
   April 24th, 1990—we were actually just preparing for my second birthday.<br>
   The murder occurred in the streets of Nezahualcóyotl. My father was a<br>
   judicial. He was doing his job, he was arresting people left and right,<br>
   doing his job quite well actually. He was excelling. He was a very good<br>
   agent and it appears as though he was targeting drug-related criminals. So,<br>
   he was murdered at gunpoint with a machine gun. I guess he was shot like<br>
   eighty times. That led to the impulse of my mom wanting to leave. One,<br>
   because my uncles from that side of the family didn't want my mom to claim<br>
   anything since we had a restaurant, we had like two, three homes, my dad<br>
   had a few cars amongst other things, he had weapons machine guns and stuff<br>
   like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: So, they didn't take my father's death lightly. They actually<br>
   wanted to take me away from her and I guess because they felt that she<br>
   wasn't apt to raise me since my father was basically the one paying for<br>
   everything. My mom was taking care of business too, but she was mainly just<br>
   there to take care of us. She didn't really work at that time, so they're<br>
   like, "Hey, give him to us we'll raise him." Part of my family at the time<br>
   was religious so they're like, we will give him a better home. So my mom<br>
   decided, hey, this is not happening, that's my son and we're leaving. So I<br>
   was in second grade when this happened, of elementary school. We took off,<br>
   I got a tourist visa and we left. My mom actually left before me. Why? The<br>
   explanation I got from her was so that she can check out the situation<br>
   first and not put me in any sort of danger. So basically I stayed with my<br>
   aunt an extra year. She took off and by the time she felt stable, she<br>
   called for me. So, that's pretty much what happened.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And do you remember your first day in the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Yeah, I was disappointed because I felt it was going to be very<br>
   different when in my perception it really wasn't. Yeah, the streets were a<br>
   little different, but I was expecting to see something more exotic like,<br>
   "Oh wow, this crazy land of opportunity." But in reality it was pretty much<br>
   the same.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And you went to school, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Yes. I went to school here for kindergarten and first and<br>
   second grade. I was actually just finishing second grade here in Coyoacán…<br>
   I actually went to second grade whilst my mom was over there and once I<br>
   finished my second grade she's like, "Hey, it's time. I want my son here."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And what was school like in the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: When I first got there, I had to make friends the hard way.<br>
   Actually my first weeks I got into fights because of the lack of speaking<br>
   the language got me bullied pretty hard. It's kind of sad and funny at the<br>
   same time that in the street that I went to live, it was nothing but<br>
   Mexican people. But the fact that I didn't speak the language put me like<br>
   as a subordinate. I've been considered an inferior because of like, "Yo,<br>
   this dude doesn't even speak English." So that kind of made me a target,<br>
   but I learned pretty quickly. I had to survive, I had to learn to survive<br>
   the hard way. I had to become proficient at fighting to avoid getting beat<br>
   up and that also fueled me in the sense that I pushed myself pretty hard in<br>
   school just so I can catch up to the other kids.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Did you have any friends? Any teachers that you particularly<br>
   remember that was influential?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Yeah, there was a family, and I made friends with the dude my<br>
   age. I actually got in a fight with him first. Why? I can't really remember<br>
   why we fought, but after that fight—kind of like the fact that I stood toe<br>
   to toe with him—he's like, "Okay, I respect you now." We got into a fight<br>
   and his brother was like, "All right, this guy is a muchacho." Funny that<br>
   after the fight ended, I actually went back home to cry. Yeah. I cried a<br>
   lot because I'm like, “Dude I hate it here. I want to go back.” But the<br>
   next day that same kid came and was looking for me, like, "Hey, let's<br>
   play." I'm like, "Dude, we just fought." And like, "Yeah, so what? Let's<br>
   play." I'm like, "Okay." So I felt accepted so yeah, I got introduced to<br>
   his bigger brothers. He had a smaller brother and we just started playing<br>
   and that kind of helped a lot break the ice, I guess, in a very violent<br>
   way.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Do you have any particularly fond memories from that time?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Yeah, actually the street was a cul-de-sac so the fact that it<br>
   was a cul-de-sac would mean that it would double as a baseball field and as<br>
   a soccer field. We would play all sorts of games there. It was such a<br>
   beautiful setup. All my neighbors were like, after that fight, they<br>
   recognized me. So I was recognized by the entire street and I made a lot of<br>
   friends very quickly.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And now if you'd have to pick what would you say was your best<br>
   experience in the United States and what was the worst one?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: School, college in particular.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: The best or the worst?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: The best by far. I've had so much amazing experiences in my<br>
   community college. It was just, like I said, you grow up being told that a<br>
   certain race is such a way. I had so much black friends, white friends,<br>
   Asian friends, and they were all super, super awesome. I don't know if it's<br>
   just me, I don't know if I just got lucky, but I had so much fun.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I just had the most amazing time ever. I met Cubans, Puerto<br>
   Ricans, Salvadorans. I mean oh my God, I remember going to this Guatemalan<br>
   friend's house—pupusas there [Sharpe Exhale] I just was eating and eating<br>
   and his mom was just totally amazing. Well, actually I would have to say<br>
   that high school was also super, super awesome due to the fact that just so<br>
   much open-minded people. I mean you grow up with this, me personally, you<br>
   grow up with this pride like, “Yo soy Mexicano,” and this and that, but you<br>
   kind of humble down once you see your other Latino and the struggles that<br>
   everybody goes through me. When you grow up as a Mexican-American—I guess<br>
   I'm not Mexican-American I'm Mexican—but you grow up seeing how your<br>
   Honduran brothers come from much farther away. You still have to cross<br>
   Guatemala and Mexico and you hear them what they go through and like, "Holy<br>
   crap." I had two friends that told me, "Hey man I came on a boat." It's<br>
   harsh. It's horrible. And the fact that the situation back home is very,<br>
   very hard.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I know that when the hurricane hit Puerto Rico there's like a<br>
   lot of people were left with nothing and I can relate. And that made me<br>
   feel much better because when there's necessity in one part of the world,<br>
   you kind of want to help. And the same thing with Haiti when the earthquake<br>
   happened and now our earthquake. And it's like, wow, it makes you real<br>
   close with people. So I'd have to say that overall, just high school and<br>
   college were just amazing. Now the worst part well I mean pretty much when<br>
   I got caught I guess.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah. So overall you had a positive experience?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Extremely positive.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Diversity in the United States—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I think that's what made my stay in the US the most beautiful<br>
   thing ever. I lived in ___. ____ is pretty much the South—more of the<br>
   richer, more high-income people that's mainly Caucasian. But luckily for me<br>
   as a student, I have always had access to like parties and stuff, and I<br>
   wasn't really discriminated ever. Actually, as a gardener you go work for<br>
   these people, but they never had once say, "Hey you dirty Mexican do it."<br>
   On the contrary, they would give us gifts sometimes since we did a very<br>
   good job. There was a guy I used to work for in a mansion, like a small<br>
   mansion, and the dude—I was thirteen for crying out loud, I was working—but<br>
   the dude saw that I was playing with the dog. I wasn't really working. My<br>
   pops would get very pissed because like, "Yo dude, we're here to work."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: And the guy was just seeing me, this young kid, and he'd pay me<br>
   really well. He paid me even more than my dad. Like, "You're a young kid,<br>
   you keep doing that, you keep working hard." The dude came from a German<br>
   family of immigrants, so he knows. He too was like, “I too grew up working<br>
   as a child, as an adolescent.” So he recognized, "Hey you know what? Don't<br>
   lose that." And I was working in this mansion, it was just a patch of<br>
   grass—like a patch the size of this—and we were mainly doing flower work,<br>
   but the dude had a huge house. He'd buy us this banquet of food and fruits<br>
   and all this. “Hey, go ahead, and, hey, come here.” He’d give us breaks all<br>
   the time. He didn't care. He just wanted to see us take care of the house<br>
   and the dog was just always looking for me. I was playing with the dog. And<br>
   same thing when I would go to LA a lot. Black people were always cool to me<br>
   too.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I had a lot of cool black friends—never once had an issue. I<br>
   know that in Cali—you probably maybe know this, maybe not—but like in LA<br>
   precisely, Mexicans and blacks go at it pretty hard for gang territory. So<br>
   for me, since I wasn't really a gang member, I never really got involved in<br>
   that. I actually had a lot of black friends that were really cool. Same<br>
   thing with the Asians. In the North part of Orange County, you have a place<br>
   called Little Saigon. Saigon is a city in Vietnam, so you go to that part<br>
   of the city and everything is like in Asian, like Japanese, Chinese, like<br>
   the symbols, and you get to eat a lot of really good stuff. I had a lot of<br>
   Asian friends that used to race. Yeah, illegal street racing—it was a big<br>
   thing in ___ so I kind of got involved in that a little bit. But mainly<br>
   because I love cars. So I had that diversity thing has always, always,<br>
   always been my thing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: At the end of the day, I don't consider myself Mexican. I<br>
   consider myself just a citizen of the world. Just a person, a human being<br>
   with an elevated consciousness. The ego is something that really hurts you<br>
   sometimes, it's good to be proud, but at the end of the day, we're just<br>
   flesh and bone. We're in this temporary vessel we call body, the conscience<br>
   is much higher. It radiates and goes beyond this three dimensional reality.<br>
   But I'm human, I'm Mexican. Hey, I'm blessed is all got to say.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: In your survey you mentioned the numerous jobs that you had. So<br>
   what would you say was your favorite job and your least favorite job in the<br>
   United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Gardening by far because you work with mother earth. I called<br>
   her mother because it's a very feminine energy. I mean, birth pretty much<br>
   explains it. You look at fruit, fruit is feminine because it ... think<br>
   about it, the seeds, it's very feminine. There's a lot of masculinity too,<br>
   but I think that feminine energy is what allows us to ... I mean both are<br>
   important and there's the yin and yang, but the fact that you get to work<br>
   with it firsthand is beautiful. The fact that you work to keep something<br>
   alive and to nurture it, I think that's a key element in understanding the<br>
   way this works, this whole ecosystem works. The fact that you have to put a<br>
   lot of love into the planting, you can't just toss it. No, hold on, treat<br>
   us with care because some—las palmas—you can't just pop it out, the roots<br>
   die immediately.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: So, you have to do it in such a way that when you're replanting<br>
   palm trees you have to be very careful not to expose the roots. If the air<br>
   hits it for enough time, it's just going to die and it's sad seeing such a<br>
   beautiful thing just rot. That's literally what happens: it rots. Sure,<br>
   that rotting piece of a plant you can leave it there and eventually it'll<br>
   come back to the ground. But I've had cases where when we had to replant<br>
   palm tree and I just was hacking away and, "Oh no, you ruined it." Because<br>
   I cut parts of the roots I wasn't supposed to, so it actually did hurt me.<br>
   It's like, “Damn.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: And the worst job I'd have to say was plumbing because you're<br>
   just dealing with feces and stuff, it's a wet job. One time I was, “Boom,”<br>
   when hit a PVC pipe and just water everywhere, dirty water. It's not a fun<br>
   job, had to do it. And I didn't have to do it, the only things you have to<br>
   do in this life are growing old and dying. Even breathing is a choice so I<br>
   didn't have to do it. It was a necessity. Yes, a small necessity, but it<br>
   got bread on the table.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: You mentioned in your survey too that you were the victim of<br>
   violent crime in the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Yeah, a lot of violent crimes actually.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Could you elaborate a little bit?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Okay, this is going to be a little long, I actually am very<br>
   comfortable. I grew up in a not so nice part of the city at first. ____<br>
   California, is divided into from very ghetto to very nice. So I wouldn't<br>
   say I grew up in the very ghetto, but the next level, which is ghetto. So,<br>
   it was daily, on a daily basis, I heard gunshots. I saw people getting<br>
   blasted with a gun. People were fighting on a daily basis. I too fought a<br>
   lot. I dedicated myself to event coordinating and promoting. I would do<br>
   house parties for money. So, I actually got shot at at my parties because I<br>
   had a party crew, I guess you can say. A party crew is basically a crew of<br>
   people who like to party and organize events but it was done with innocent<br>
   intentions.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: So, part of these people were indeed in gangs. I was surrounded<br>
   by gangs my whole life, gang life was basically high school life. In high<br>
   school, you had people fighting over high school. Gang members were like,<br>
   "Okay, you're from middle side, you're from ___. So, who's you chilling<br>
   with?” I chilled with both. They're like, "Nah, half these fools are in<br>
   Nashalala." Always fighting, so I was always caught in the crossfire.<br>
   Always. But I kept my essence strong. I brought my business and I had<br>
   friends from all gangs and I got involved with all of them, but I wasn't in<br>
   their gang activities, just their friends. You grew up with them as a young<br>
   kid, so by the time you end up a grownup, they respect you, but they're<br>
   like, "I'm a gang member you're not." Maybe you're walking down the street<br>
   and you're seen, "Hi yo, what's up man? Why are you hanging out with that<br>
   fool for? That fool is from this gang and you're my boy too but…” I have to<br>
   fight a lot, a lot, a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And when you were shot at were you ever hit?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Nope. They came in a beat up car, they saw me, and I saw the<br>
   Uzi just popped out. I throw myself on the ground and they just sprayed the<br>
   party. They knew that it was predominantly…. because I was throwing it in a<br>
   hood called F troop. F troop had their base around the park. So basically,<br>
   what ended up happening was that I was not targeted, but I was throwing a<br>
   party where it was like a gang, I guess very gang. So they just came and<br>
   they just sprayed the party so I just tossed myself to the ground.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And did people die?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: No, actually no. But some people did get hit and when that<br>
   happened the guys in my party went to seek revenge and they did kill the<br>
   dudes that shot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Wow.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: And that was just a weekly thing. I mean, gang violence was<br>
   very hardcore.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: That's crazy. Now we're going to transition a little bit into<br>
   talking about your return to Mexico. How old were you when you came back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Twenty-one.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And can you tell me how you ended up here starting from before you<br>
   were deported to leading up to that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Yeah. Okay. Now I tend to get very judged on this, so I hope<br>
   that this is—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: No judgment here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Okay, so something that I love is chemicals. I actually studied<br>
   a chemical engineering degree in SAC. I was very close to finishing. I got<br>
   involved with MDMA. I wasn't manufacturing it, but I was selling it. Why?<br>
   Well, I mean you could say with so much work in the States, why did you<br>
   decide on doing this? Well, it was very easy for me to do. I loved doing<br>
   it. Not so much in the sense that I loved the money, but I love studying<br>
   the chemicals.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Actually, prior to me doing it for recreational purposes, I was<br>
   studying the effects on schizophrenic people. And I was doing the whole<br>
   rave thing and I sold MDMA to pay for school. I was working, but I was<br>
   doing 18 units. I don't know if you know how the school system in the US<br>
   works, but 18 units is actually much more. I even did 20 units in some<br>
   semesters. So you have the typical 12 units, I was doing 20. My chemistry<br>
   class was a five-hour block so just imagine that. It was six units by<br>
   itself, just the chemistry class with its lab. So, you have a six hour,<br>
   [Sharp exhale], just huge block with 30-minute rest and I had critical<br>
   thinking after—I had calculus and that was just a day.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: And man, I was there from eight in the morning to ten at night.<br>
   And no, I'm not excusing myself, this is basically just my life as a<br>
   student and I'd made the wrong decision. That's life. So I was a full time<br>
   student from Monday through Thursday, on Fridays I would exercise because I<br>
   had a stability ball class. I had a bunch of like exercise classes. So<br>
   Saturdays and Sundays were pretty much my only days to generate income. So<br>
   I would go in the mornings with my father to work the fields, landscaping<br>
   all that good stuff. So during the evenings I would organize events and at<br>
   the same time I had the pills with me so I would sell them. Do you want me<br>
   to continue?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Okay. So basically what started off as a tiny hobby eventually<br>
   became like a big thing. I would actually eventually carry like up to a<br>
   hundred pills at once or more. Not only that, but I would DJ, I was a DJ, a<br>
   promoter and event coordinator and I was doing my site stuff. But you know<br>
   that I actually did it. I started doing that when I was 14, left it alone<br>
   because I was okay with money, and I started again hardcore when I was like<br>
   21. I started off with like 10 pills and eventually I got to like 400<br>
   pills. How it happened was this: I organized an event in the Galaxy Theater<br>
   which was a big deal—it was a huge event, and a lot of money went towards<br>
   making that event happen. It got canceled because people were just too<br>
   chaotic. It was just out of control.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: My events would get severely packed and hot, so people were<br>
   just ... it was just a mess. It got shut down. So what I did was I had a<br>
   warehouse and my friend had a warehouse, so I said, "You know what, we're<br>
   moving the party to the warehouse." I get there, and apparently the chaotic<br>
   people that went to that party also went to that warehouse. So the cops<br>
   came, and I was actually in a car with friends drinking and stuff. And when<br>
   the cops came, I had about a hundred pills on me. So that was bad. I got<br>
   caught with like a hundred pills. And that's pretty much what happened. It<br>
   was a possession for sale of a schedule one substance,<br>
   3,4-Methylene​dioxy​amphetamine, which is a chemical name for MDMA.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I didn't really try to avoid any persecution or prosecution. I<br>
   told the cops straight up, "Hey, here's my college ID. I'm a chemical<br>
   engineer. I do not manufacture these myself, but I do sell them to maintain<br>
   my school expenses." My parents at the time were barely, barely making it,<br>
   so I made a bad decision. I wanted to take care of the expenses through an<br>
   illegal means.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: College in the United States is very expensive.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: And that was great for me because I did what I love, which was<br>
   deejaying and I saw it as easy. But the guy, even he, just put his hand on<br>
   his palm—he like face palmed himself—and he was like, "Dude, how much left<br>
   do you have until you graduate?" Like two semesters. I just need calculus<br>
   one. I need a psychology class, which was in progress—I was Intro to<br>
   Psychology 101. I needed a speech class, which was in progress. My organic<br>
   chemistry one was pretty much in progress. So I was basically a semester<br>
   away from getting my associates in chemistry with a minor in English. So,<br>
   when I called my mom from jail, she just broke down. She was like, “Yo come<br>
   on.” I mean she didn't say yo, but everybody was just extremely<br>
   disappointed because they had really high hopes for me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: So, I disappointed everybody, that's the most difficult thing,<br>
   it hurts. It really does hurt. I mean for me too. Jail for me was easy<br>
   because like I said, I actually had a name for myself. They knew me as<br>
   Godfather because I had a lot of fame in Orange County—a lot of people knew<br>
   me because of my events. I forgot to mention that I was very, very like a<br>
   small celebrity in my County for many reasons. So, when I got to jail, I<br>
   was received very well. They gave me like all this good stuff, so jail for<br>
   me was actually pretty, pretty light.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Okay. And how long were you there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Like four months, five months.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Was that your sentence or how—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Yeah. Because I didn’t fight anything. The cop was like, "Yo<br>
   man, I can't help you. I can't even let you go.” Because I got let go a lot<br>
   of times. I forgot to mention that during. My party scene brigade. I was<br>
   partying left and right, never had a license, never had anything. I even<br>
   driving crazy and stuff. And I was the typical wild super drunk, all that<br>
   stuff. I lived a really good life in the States. I had a car when I was 17.<br>
   I had my life pretty much set. I was living the American dream. I was<br>
   living a very good life. We moved into a middle-class neighborhood, ____,<br>
   actually. And my mom has a beautiful house. I mean, wow, like just, I look<br>
   back and say, "lo que me perdí,” pero I'm in Mexico and am loving every<br>
   second of it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I think actually I have grown spiritually exponentially since I<br>
   got here because I was very materialistic in the States. I really was. If<br>
   you consider life in the States, you say you haven't lived there much, but<br>
   it's extremely competitive. So I've always wanted to have the best stuff<br>
   because I did get consumed by consumerism and materialism in the States.<br>
   That's just me being honest, and brutally honest. That's primarily the<br>
   reason why I started selling MDMA in the first place because landscaping<br>
   wasn't getting me much. So my materialistic hunger drove me to those<br>
   extremes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Why? Because my citizen friends had all nice trucks, nice cell<br>
   phones, nice clothes. They had it a little bit easier, a little bit, tiny<br>
   bit. So I just wanted to give myself a little boost and say, "Hey, I'm<br>
   going to sell this and be blinged out too." Because at the time, I don't<br>
   know if you remember, that was like 2009, 10, 11, when the whole grills<br>
   movement was popping, the little “Let's be blinged out,” diamond earrings<br>
   type thing. Got to have them big chains and little get down. See, I still<br>
   kind of have that, this is kind of like my—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: I was going to ask you about it—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: “Lo último.” Es plata. No es la gran cosa, pero es como un<br>
   pequeño recuerdo de lo que fui, o sea. It’s the best. [It’s silver. It’s<br>
   not a big deal, but it’s like a small souvenir of what I was, kind of.] I<br>
   was this very materialistic driven individual, very competitive. Since I<br>
   got from the States, I became like that because of the bullying and that<br>
   bullying was constant throughout my entire life. One because soy pequeño,<br>
   [I’m short] you see my size, so the typical height for an American is what?<br>
   Like almost like ... Well I'm very short compared to African Americans and<br>
   whites and a lot of our island like Cubanos y Puertorriqueños son grandes.<br>
   [Cubans, Puerto Ricans, are tall] So, we're the small people, we've got the<br>
   small gene, so all my life I'd been ... That's why it kind of made me, like<br>
   it forged me. I was forged in the fires of bullying.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Tell me a little bit more about your deportation process. So you<br>
   were detained or arrested?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Actually, it was very, very light. I was arrested—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: After you left jail?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: No, I was arrested for my MDMA possession, for selling.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah exactly, and you stayed in jail for four months and—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: And from jail, the exit was right there, beautiful. I was<br>
   actually already contemplating receiving my family, hugging them, [Sigh]<br>
   and then, “Come with me. ____.” He even pronounced my name well—I was like,<br>
   "Oh wow, you got it right." "Hey, come here. You're coming with me. ICE has<br>
   a hold on you." Argh, I just felt that Argh feeling was just…I felt ice. I<br>
   just felt like a super cold bucket. My world just deteriorated right in<br>
   front of me. It completely destroyed me, I was like, "Oh no, ICE!" But I<br>
   had contemplated that actually and I wasn't hurt. I didn't cry because I<br>
   knew what I had done. So, slowly but surely that beautiful image of me<br>
   receiving my family just broke into pieces, slowly. It just disintegrated<br>
   into the abyss. I was like in an abyss of “Argh, no.” It happened.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I was handcuffed, boom, boom, get on the bus. And we were taken<br>
   not too far away—actually it was within ____—and I was processed there. And<br>
   once they took me, the treatment was actually not that bad. So, with<br>
   respect, obviously “Hurry up,” and we went to this place called ____, which<br>
   was by my house. I could literally have jumped the wall and I could have<br>
   been at my house. I was like five minutes away from my house, so close, so<br>
   close. So, I would literally, when we had yard time in ____, I would look<br>
   up at sky, I'm like, "Yo dude, I could hear the traffic that I would hear<br>
   when I was at home." And the theater, there was this plaza called ____, so<br>
   you could hear people laughing and stuff. It was very demoralizing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And did you have any contact with your family while you were in<br>
   detention?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Throughout the entire time. My mom couldn't visit me because at<br>
   the time she was still fighting. That was actually what made it very<br>
   hurtful, that I never got to formally say goodbye. Only my citizen family<br>
   members and my ex-girlfriend, she went, and my best friend. She actually<br>
   would deposit me money like $100 like, “Hey here, here, here.” Although we<br>
   had broken up very badly. Not in the sense that ... Not violent, but like<br>
   we both were destroyed afterwards.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Then what happened? How long were you in the detention center?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Like two weeks.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And then they took you to Tijuana and they were like —<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Actually, I went through ___ to the farm. They kept moving me<br>
   around. The farm was actually extremely pleasant because you had like two<br>
   hours of yard time and my bunkie was from Armenia. He was there for<br>
   banking—some super high hardcore, super, I don't know. The dude had a ton<br>
   of money and, whenever his commissary came by, he got like huge, huge, huge<br>
   bags of stuff, like “hey, toma.” [here, take it] Armenian people are really<br>
   cool. Actually, Middle Eastern people in there, they were like mostly there<br>
   for huge money issues and the Mexicans that I met were like for huge money<br>
   drug related. So I never had an inconvenience there at all.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: On the contrary, I was there like king status—always had backup<br>
   from family. My people would deposit me, ex-girlfriend would deposit me,<br>
   like good amounts of cash so I was always like chilling, working out. I<br>
   worked also in the kitchen during jail time and in detainee. So I would eat<br>
   like a lard. I would eat real good. I gained weight, I gained muscle mass.<br>
   It was a good time for me to just humble down because I fed off the<br>
   reputation that I had in the streets. I had a rep, I mean, to this day<br>
   people still call me that name. People that know me from the States still<br>
   call me “Godfather.” Think of it like this: I was this short little<br>
   midget-looking Mexican guy running the party scene in his own way and with<br>
   these huge gang members. Like, "Hey godfather what's happened?" And they're<br>
   like, "Oh man, you hurt me." And like, "Oh sorry."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: This huge little tiny guy just… I would go to ___ a lot and<br>
   people would know me from ___ like, “You're godfather from the ____ party<br>
   scene?” “Yeah.” Like, “Oh well welcome to the ____ party scene.” But they<br>
   were more gang-like. “Hey man, that's not me but okay.” So, during my stay<br>
   I had a lot of love, especially from this dude from El Salvador and this<br>
   dude from Puebla. They were like my go-to-guys. Had any issues, "Hey, yo,<br>
   man there's some beef right here." “No, don't worry about it.” “Hey man,<br>
   that's my friend. Leave him alone.” “Okay.” I pretty much had it very easy,<br>
   but también porque ya venía apalabrado—like I had my street side to back me<br>
   up. So super, super pleasant, ate really well. I was pretty much sleeping<br>
   most of the time just comiendo, durmiendo, [eating sleeping] chilling. When<br>
   the judge saw me, she's like, "MDMA? Immediately remove this individual<br>
   from the States." But she said it in such a hateful manner, dude. Even when<br>
   I came in—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: As if like white people don't do MDMA or don't do silly things.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Actually, my customers were mainly white and Asian. I'd like to<br>
   point that out, that my clientele was mainly Asian and white and it was<br>
   like pretty much even. But like I said, I got along so well with people<br>
   both white… I never got that discrimination. It was a beautiful thing.<br>
   Maybe it's because I was like the go-to-guy, I don't know, maybe es como<br>
   dicen, “el dinero quita defectos.” [as they say, money is blind] So the<br>
   fact that I had the good stuff and also I had money maybe that's what made<br>
   people see me as this, I don't know. But I think that they were genuinely<br>
   cool with me because the rave people are about peace, love, unity and<br>
   respect, the PLUR thing. That's like a thing where you put your hand and<br>
   share a bracelet, so it looks like the love thing, I guess. I don't know if<br>
   it's really love, but maybe you can, it's some trastorno psicológico.<br>
   [psychological defect]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Anyway, so we have the judge was very just like when … Para<br>
   empezar, [for starters] they had us chained up, like very, very. Let me<br>
   demonstrate, there's a chain here, a chain here, a chain here. We just<br>
   literally had to walk like that. You were like in shackles. The most<br>
   heartbreaking thing was seeing my family destroyed when I came in like<br>
   that. Like it’s bringing in El Chapo, not even El Chapo had that much. So,<br>
   they brought me in like if I was like a high, like super...Yeah, it was<br>
   bad. It was real bad because I just saw ... I couldn't even look their way,<br>
   like, don't look over there. The guy was just like, “Go in there, don't be<br>
   turning around, don't be so.” I remember the expression he just went… And I<br>
   just sat there like with my head down, I couldn't look back. But I could<br>
   hear sus lamentos, llorando. [their cries, crying] They were very sickly<br>
   destroyed. You could hear. You didn't have to look to notice how destroyed<br>
   they were. I'm sorry. Bad decisions, they cost dearly sometimes. It's okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And so coming back to Mexico, how was that like? What happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: The first two years were very, very depressing. It took me<br>
   about a year and a half to just assimilate everything. I was very<br>
   depressed. One, because people didn't accept me right away. One because I<br>
   had a thick accent, my Spanish wasn't at 100%. People see you as this<br>
   opportunity to make easy money kind of thing. Cause, Like you go out in the<br>
   streets and you ask for something, they’re like, “este güey es pocho.”<br>
   [that dude is pocho] They give you stuff more expensive, amongst other<br>
   things. I mean, you ask for directions sometimes they send you to the wrong<br>
   place just because they like to fuck with people. Sorry about the cursing,<br>
   I apologize. But what liberated me from all of that is that I actually, my<br>
   first job was down the street, TeleTech, it was a dish network. So that<br>
   kind of helped a lot. The fact that I wasn't alone, the fact that I shared<br>
   this experience. My first wave, the stories were pretty much identical. So<br>
   that gave me strength, the fact that I wasn't the only deportee. I mean I<br>
   knew I wasn't, but it helped a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: But I was pretty down actually the first year and a half. I<br>
   wanted to go back. I dearly missed my family. My mom even said "Hey, I'll<br>
   pay for you to come back." “No, not anymore. I'm here now. I'm alone.<br>
   Gracias, pero ya soy independiente.” [thanks, but I am idependent] I'm<br>
   sorry. Is it okay if I say that in Spanish? “Ya soy independiente, y has<br>
   hecho mucho por mi, pero tengo que pagar por mis errores y lo voy a hacer.<br>
   Por más que este muy deprimido, por más que este triste, necesito aprender<br>
   alla hacer las cosas por mi mismo, y bien.” [I am independent, you have<br>
   done a lot for me, but I have to pay for my mistakes and I will. Although I<br>
   am depressed, although I am sad, I need to learn to do things on my own,<br>
   and well] So, basically, I rejected all. My mom was like, "Come on, we'll<br>
   get you back." “No, no, no. I don't want to go back because I have to<br>
   basically feed that ... I have to redo that bad karma that all those years<br>
   I fed so much. I want to just neutralize that and actually construct<br>
   something in my place of origin.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I mean my name Cuauhtémoc, it's Nahuatl, it means, “aguila que<br>
   desciende.” [descending eagle] So, I took that really into heart and said,<br>
   “I have the name of an Aztec emperor. I am an Aztec emperor.” I consider<br>
   myself an emperor. I consider all of us to be Gods because we have the<br>
   power to create and destroy. So, I said just like how I destroyed over<br>
   there, I can create here. Puedo crear un patrimonio aquí en mi lugar de<br>
   origen. [I can create a patrimony in my place of origin] In this beautiful<br>
   place, and for that reason I declined, I don't want to go back. Maybe it<br>
   was because pride also had to do a lot with my decision. But now that I<br>
   look back, I'm very proud in the sense that I'm one of a few family members<br>
   that actually has made it out alone.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Most of my cousins still live with their parents my age. Some<br>
   haven't left the nest. I left the nest at twenty-one. I started working<br>
   when I was twelve. So, I feel proud of the fact that I had to learn what<br>
   hard work was like very early. It kind of made it not too difficult for me.<br>
   It kind of eased the transition to the point where when I started working,<br>
   it was like a whatever thing. I left my aunt's house very quickly. I was<br>
   there for like two, three months and I said, "Hey, I'm gone. Thank you."<br>
   Oh, I forgot to mention when I got here from the States, my family was very<br>
   discriminant of me because of what I had come for, which was basically<br>
   possession for sale. You could even manejarlo como un narcomenudeo, I guess<br>
   you can say. They did not take that positively at all. They're like, "Yo,<br>
   what the heck were you thinking? You were dealing drugs and you're now in<br>
   my household. I have a criminal in my household. Get away."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: They would tell me, “No hables ingles porque te van a<br>
   secuestrar. No te vistes asi porque te ves como un criminal.” [don’t speak<br>
   English because you will be kidnapped. Don’t dress like that because you<br>
   look like a criminal] I had pierced earrings and they're like, “No eso, no<br>
   más los criminales usan eso. No te pongas esas gorras porque parece que vas<br>
   a robar el micro.”[not that, only criminals use these. Don’t wear those<br>
   hats because it looks like you are going to rob the bus] So you understand<br>
   that when I came here I was heavily, heavily discriminated by my own<br>
   family. That was pretty rough. That's primarily the reason why I was so<br>
   depressed because I had it pretty hard with the family. They were pushing<br>
   me down so hard, but I made it. I'm still here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And did you go to school? Did you try to finish college?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Basically, I went to do the test. I did not study for the test.<br>
   People—I've heard these crazy stories of so many people failing and like<br>
   it's so hard, no it's not. Maybe because I had three years of university to<br>
   back me up, three and a half. I just felt like that test was a super piece<br>
   of cake. I mean the chemistry, the sciences, physics and chemistry, I got<br>
   100%. Math was like 90%. I failed only literature for obvious reasons, but<br>
   universal history got a pretty high score. I got much high scores in<br>
   everything except in Spanish, like literature and with composition, like<br>
   Spanish composition. If it would have been English composition, I would<br>
   have dominated that easy. [Laughs]. But yeah, basically—oh and Mexican<br>
   history was—I just bombed that test horribly. I got like two out of ten<br>
   right. [Sharp exhale]. Dismal. And the only stuff that I got right was like<br>
   the pre-Hispanic history like, “When did Cortés show up?”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Oh my gosh.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: That was ultra-easy so [Sharp exhale] 1521, obvio. [obviously]<br>
   I think he got to Puerto Rico first and Veracruz, he did a lot of<br>
   atrocities in Puerto Rico also. Mr. Hernán Cortés. Anyway, so I happily<br>
   bring my results to reception and the lady kind of saw my smile and like,<br>
   eh, desde allí, como [from then, like] “you cocky B-A-S-T-A-R-D” because<br>
   para empezar, [for starters] I spoke to her in English. Why? I don't know.<br>
   That was kind of my fault, people don't like being spoken to in English. I<br>
   guess people get offended. I don't know. No les gusta que… “Oye, [they<br>
   don’t like it because] hey, I'm done.” “¿Qué?” “Oh, I'm sorry.” That's when<br>
   that care is like piercing, “ah wait, sorry. I'm sorry. Ya acabé mi<br>
   examen.”[I finished my exam] “Okay.” And I showed her my high school<br>
   diploma, “Esto que no sirve.” [that is of no use] That just broke my heart.<br>
   That's like, “aquí esto no sirve.” [that is of no use] I'm like, “What do<br>
   you mean, como que no sirve? [how come it’s of no use] That's a lot of<br>
   years of dedication. That's my life. What do you mean que no sirve?” “Aquí<br>
   no sirve,” [it’s of no use] but in such a hateful, super, super hateful way<br>
   that my heart just popped.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Anyway, I said, “You know what? Well, si no te sirve a ti, pues<br>
   esto no me sirves a mí. No quiero estudiar.” [if that is of no use, well,<br>
   this is of no use to me. I don’t want to study.] I was making sick cash in<br>
   TeleTech. I was doing triple hours, I was getting bonuses left and right. I<br>
   was getting like, my paycheck was like, 8000 a month. Then I was getting<br>
   almost double with just overtime in bonuses, so I felt like a big baller. I<br>
   was like, “Oh yeah, I'm balling again. But that's because I would ask my<br>
   family, what's the medium income like? What's the minimum wage? Like 80<br>
   pesos a day or 60, I don't know? That was my stupid little me, “Oh yeah,<br>
   I'm making way more than minimum wage.” And I felt good and went like,<br>
   "Screw school. I don't need school. As long as I keep selling and doing mad<br>
   overtime and hitting my metrics, I'm going to ball hard and I‘m gonna get a<br>
   car.” But silly me, I should have continued. I was actually trying to major<br>
   in English teaching because I love teaching.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: One of the things that I loved doing in college was tutoring.<br>
   That's a thing that I like to do is transmit knowledge, transmit wisdom. I<br>
   think the best way that you can make this world a better place is by<br>
   sharing. No matter what it is, so the fact that I can transmit the little<br>
   bit of knowledge that I have to you. It's like basically implanting a seed<br>
   in your brain and you decide if you want to nurture it or not. That's<br>
   basically up to you if you want to keep sharing the gift of knowledge, you<br>
   have to nurture the seed that I plant. Whether it's morals, whether it's<br>
   literature, whether it's a trade. I'm sharing this with you. I'm investing<br>
   my time and attention to transmit something to you. It's my gift. Whether<br>
   you want to see it die or not, it's really up to you. But that's basically<br>
   the interchange of morals, values, principles I think that's worth more<br>
   than gold.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: You take stuff from people and your perspective is broadened<br>
   because just like the electromagnetic spectrum, it's composed of a very<br>
   huge piece of… I mean you got radio waves and it expands to gamma rays in<br>
   this huge spectrum there's light. What we are able to see—so if you think<br>
   about it—visible light is a tiny sliver in that huge spectrum and of light.<br>
   Even light itself, ultraviolet and infrared, are unseen to the naked eye.<br>
   What does that tell you? Our perspective is extremely limited, extremely.<br>
   So when somebody donates a little bit of their perspective, it increases<br>
   and it helps you see a much broader landscape. So the fact that somebody is<br>
   taking the time to teach you something or to share something, you pay<br>
   attention. Because maybe what they're expressing, they could be extremely<br>
   passionate about, and maybe helpful. It may serve a purpose later on in<br>
   your life, so keep that in mind. When somebody shares something with you,<br>
   the least you can do is donate a little bit of attention. And I say donate<br>
   because that's really what you're doing. You're donating time. Time is<br>
   valuable.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: I agree. Yeah. And do you think that you have found here in<br>
   Mexico, something that you had in the US? It doesn't have to be material<br>
   things. It can also be a feeling—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Myself. I found myself, I was lost for so many years pursuing<br>
   the wrong things. I was only doing school primarily because I was being<br>
   forced. I studied chemistry because I love chemicals, but in reality it<br>
   wasn't really my passion. I think teaching is much more something I like.<br>
   Literature is lovely, I love art. I'm not an artist, but I love the<br>
   appreciation of art. If I were to show you my phone, my gallery, I have<br>
   some really nice photos. My phone takes nice photos—not to show off, but I<br>
   actually do pride myself in some of the photos I've taken. I love<br>
   architecture, I love meeting people from other places, not that I don't<br>
   like Mexicans, but la comida, food is something that I absolutely enjoy,<br>
   music, just culture itself.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: That's why I think that I'm in the right place. Why? I mean,<br>
   ultimamente, [recently] I've been meeting people from all over the place<br>
   and I'm very happy to hear that people from other countries come here and<br>
   see for themselves what Mexico is like. That makes me very, very happy. It<br>
   makes me extremely happy to know that people come to share. I mean, you go<br>
   downtown, there's a Chinatown here too. There's a lot of people from Haiti,<br>
   a lot of people from Guatemala. I myself had Honduran neighbors so I've<br>
   always loved to mix myself with other races and cultures. So short answer,<br>
   myself. I found myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What do you miss about the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: My family. That's pretty much it. Luxuries I can have here.<br>
   Beaches I have here, beautiful landscapes I have here. It's the family, my<br>
   brothers and sisters, mainly my mom, my stepdad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And would you go back to the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I don't want to, only if I have to. I mean there's no such<br>
   thing as “I have to.” Actually it's all choices.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And why wouldn't you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Siento que tengo muchas cosas que hacer aquí. [I feel as though<br>
   I have a lot to get done here.} I have—tengo un patrimonio que tengo que<br>
   construir. [I have a patrimony I need to build] I don't intend on having<br>
   kids not so much because I don't ... I love kids. I absolutely love kids<br>
   because they're the ones that are most receptive. I've donated a lot of<br>
   time into planting seeds with kids and I've taught English to kids and<br>
   they're the most appreciative in these things. I think that there are many<br>
   philosophers such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes for instance.<br>
   Machiavelli is like the whole “you're born innately evil,” whereas Hobbes<br>
   is like “you're born pure and good.” I consider that to be the truth<br>
   because I consider society to be the corrupting factor. I think we're born<br>
   pure and you learn based on your surroundings and your upbringing. So to<br>
   elaborate on Hobbes, I see these kids eager to learn and to share. Not all<br>
   of them, but es porque [it’s because] their upbringing, but mainly you see<br>
   a child full of love, full of innocence. And I see that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Me personally, I don't feel like I'm ready to be a father.<br>
   That's why the kids are out of the question. But for personal reasons, I<br>
   would love to if I, first of all, be in love with my significant other,<br>
   like have sincere love for that person. Not just, “Hey, let's do this and<br>
   for the sexual pleasure.” I think there has to be much more, a deeper<br>
   connection and it's very hard to make the connection that deep with<br>
   someone. You have to genuinely and truly love them and that's what I seek.<br>
   If I want to start a family, of course.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: If it's like a relationship, it could be like a, “All right,<br>
   let's just go out and chill” and eventually you can build on that and<br>
   that's fine. That's fine too it could be like, “Let's chill and let's hang<br>
   out,” but if it's going to be for a family that's totally different. “All<br>
   right hold on, what are you looking for? Que es lo que quieres? [What do<br>
   you want?] What are you looking for in me? What do you want to build? Do<br>
   you want to build it together? Okay, wait a minute so let's .... We got to<br>
   connect.” It's not just, “Okay, let's just do this and see how it”—no, hold<br>
   on. There's a life that you're bringing to this world that's going to be<br>
   affected by your decisions. Every single decision, even the meat<br>
   consumption and all that stuff, the fetus is aware. It's very aware,<br>
   actually you have to be very careful. Screams and stuff they can hear it.<br>
   He or she can hear it, I'm sorry, they. What the heck? Well if it twins<br>
   yeah, they. But if there's constant fighting while the fetus is developing,<br>
   that's horrible, that's bad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Some fetuses can even feel unwanted and get sick. Y se mueren.<br>
   [they die.]They die in the womb for that specific reason because they just<br>
   feel so unwanted that they're born prematurely or they're born dead from so<br>
   much negativity, intoxication, environmental intoxication. Sometimes we as<br>
   humans are so unaware of how our decisions have a huge role that ... I'm<br>
   careless sometimes, I say a lot of bad words, not with the intention to<br>
   hurt, but one word can hurt somebody so much and you don't realize it until<br>
   later. When I do it, I don't know, just try not to say so much bad words.<br>
   Pero yo lo hago así como “Esos gueyes, ponte chingon,” así, that type of<br>
   thing, but with very unhurtful intentions. If I say like “Esos gueyes,<br>
   ponte chingon,” I say with like the kindness of intentions because I know<br>
   how powerful an expression can be.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Would you recommend people to migrate to the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Depends who's asking. If it's somebody hopelessly lost, just<br>
   running away. No, don't run away from your problems ever. Never, or<br>
   backwards. If you're in Mexico running away to the States, same thing.<br>
   Don't. Go to a place to be better. Go to a place to give something. Go to a<br>
   place to make the place better, don't do it because you're running away or<br>
   because you have problems. No. Go and donate something. Go and be a beacon<br>
   for those in utter darkness and desolation. Don't go make things worse.<br>
   Porque muchos van a vender drogas. [many will sell drugs] I did it. But if<br>
   you're going to go hurt society might as well, don't go. Para que vas? Why<br>
   are you going to go make society worse than it already is? I made society<br>
   worse and I paid my karma and I lived very harsh things. Very, very harsh<br>
   things too. I mean it wasn't just happy. I got beat up a couple times and I<br>
   got robbed a few times. Hey, it's part of the process, you compensate good<br>
   karma with bad karma. I did a lot of good things too—I left a lot of good<br>
   knowledge in people. So that's why to this day I'm very blessed, extremely,<br>
   very blessed, like you have no idea.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: My last question was in what ways did being in the United States<br>
   shape who you are? I feel that you have continuously said that, but if you<br>
   want to specifically answer that too you can?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Of course, I'm extremely competitive in every way. In my work<br>
   environment, I'm highly respected because last month I did the work of<br>
   three people. We are measured by the amount of work you do. I'm a security<br>
   administrator and access management for Royal Caribbean and Adecco. I<br>
   basically create user accounts, manage their computer accesses, and the<br>
   programs they get to see. So on a monthly basis, I'm almost always first<br>
   place and usually it's by a long shot. So last month I did about a thousand<br>
   tasks myself, and it's a team of four. I did a thousand by myself and the<br>
   rest of the team did a thousand, so it was like 2000 total. But a thousand<br>
   just came from me, myself. And I'm in two campaigns, not just one, due to<br>
   the fact that I'm like the SAS or like the SEAL Team Ten. When the campaign<br>
   is broken, they send the best, and I'm one of that elite, I guess the elite<br>
   team.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I'm doing two campaigns right now. I think the graveyard people<br>
   do multiple campaigns, but it's just calls, they take calls. I don't take<br>
   calls, I do more delicate stuff. I delegate accesses, I assign certain<br>
   programs and stuff. So my competitiveness has been ... I've always been<br>
   very hungry in that sense. Since my first job here, I was doing overtime in<br>
   training because I had that spark. I'm a fast learner and, no, it's not a<br>
   brag, it's just me being sincere. I'm very fast. I've been gifted with that<br>
   fast learning capability. So I adapt quickly to my environment. [Snaps]. So<br>
   how has the US shaped me? Dominant. I seek dominance. Not in a way that it<br>
   steps on people, but I share my skills in an attempt for you to come back<br>
   also.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: Because in order for a society to grow it needs to be<br>
   collective. I come up, you come up with me. I try to pull you. If you don't<br>
   want to be pulled, that's fine, I'll leave you alone as long as you don't<br>
   bring us down. And that's basically the way I consider everything. Let's<br>
   grow, I'm not going to grow alone. You come with me, if you don't want to<br>
   grow, at least be neutral and don't hinder us. Don't hurt us. You want to<br>
   be part of the team and just as long as you play by the rules and you get<br>
   your share done, I'm okay. When you fall behind, I'm going to gently poke<br>
   you and say, "Hey, remember that tú tienes que hacer esto, you have to do<br>
   it.” And if you don't hey, you know what? I'm sorry but we have a<br>
   collective consciousness and we want to grow and I'm sorry, but you are<br>
   hindering our capability. So thus I'm going to ask you nicely, "Hey,<br>
   ayudanos, necesito que hagas tu parte, if you can't do your part, then I'm<br>
   going to have to relinquish. You have to go away. Not in the sense that<br>
   like you're shut down, I'm still going to love you and I'm going to support<br>
   you, but you're just not part of that immediate project for [inaudible].<br>
   And I'm still going to invite you to my barbecues and you're still going to<br>
   be my friend. But en cuestiones de crecimiento.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah, that's it from me. I don't know if you have anything else<br>
   that you want to add? Are you satisfied with everything?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Cuauhtémoc: I'm extremely satisfied and I'm thankful for being here. I<br>
   think I'm very appreciative of the treatment that I got today. It's very<br>
   important.<br>

   <br>
     Claudia: All right. It's Claudia and I'm doing the follow-up survey.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I remember you. [laughs]<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: I remember because we took a picture.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Yeah, we did.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: And now you're going to get more pictures taken after this.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Okay, that's fine. You should have told me. I came with a<br>
     political shirt.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: No it's fine, that's character. It's totally good.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Okay.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: We're doing the follow-up survey with 36936 Cuauhtémoc the<br>
     fifth right?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Yes.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: All right. First question is, has the last year been difficult<br>
     since we last talked?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : On the contrary, it's been very fruitful and full of<br>
     success, and the last year I managed to obtain a tier three position at<br>
     my job and I'm currently working my way up for manager. I am doing<br>
     manager tasks, and I am being entrusted with a lot of highly sensitive<br>
     information related to the contract that we're dealing with in<br>
     Compucom. We are working with Chevron, which is a gas company and we do<br>
     level three IT for them.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: That's awesome.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Thank you.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Over the year so in general, would you say that things have<br>
     gotten better?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Way better.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Way better.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : To the point where I actually consider myself very stable<br>
     and very peaceful. I have a lot of peace of mind.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: That's super great to hear. That's awesome.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Thank you.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Out of social, economic, job, family, insecurity, what's<br>
     gotten better?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Everything.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: All of them?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Although I don't really see much of my family and friends<br>
     anymore due to the high responsibility that I carry. It's been mainly<br>
     just work, work, work and just work.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Got you. So none of those have gotten worse?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : No, they've maintained a stable level. My aunts do ask me<br>
     to visit them from time to time, but it's usually pretty hard since we<br>
     have the client visit tomorrow and later today, around four or five,<br>
     depending on how long this takes. I'm going to go ahead and actually go<br>
     to the eighth floor and just set up a bunch of equipment for them to<br>
     have ready since we want the visits to have their docking stations or<br>
     monitors, some keyboards. The manager and I are going to show up and do<br>
     a lot of stuff. Last week, I know that Anita had proposed for us to<br>
     meet, but two of our elements had left the company so I had to take<br>
     over their shift and I was connected for 20 hours straight. I wasn't<br>
     going to show up here half dead.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: But you're here now.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I needed to sleep. And the nine of six with my 96 thing.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Exactly. Since your return to Mexico, have you become aware of<br>
     any programs that support returning migrants?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I'll be frank with you, I'm going to be frank during the<br>
     entire time, but I just wanted to firmly state, I'll be frank. I've<br>
     been blessed to the point where I haven't had a need to seek support,<br>
     external support, because since the moment I got here, I did get here<br>
     with my aunt's home, where a little bit oppressive because I have a<br>
     very explosive way of being, not explosive in the sense that - I'm<br>
     spontaneous, but I tend to be very loud, very friendly. My aunts were<br>
     very unsupportive of my way of being, but I sought out my own<br>
     well-being, and I've been good ever since. I haven't really had a need<br>
     for that. But I am very much aware that there are programs which I'm<br>
     very happy to hear. I had a cousin that was recently deported about a<br>
     year and a half ago.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : So, I strongly encourage for him to seek those programs<br>
     which are very beneficial, and they do help people. There has been a<br>
     lot of improvements in the way migrants have been treated. The people<br>
     that have gotten returned, repatriated, is that the word? I have seen<br>
     at least three to four programs from the government where they do help<br>
     you out. Especially in the border cities like TJ and stuff. I remember<br>
     my cousin was getting free housing, I think they offer them three<br>
     months free housing until they get their act together and they give<br>
     them little incentives here and there and they provide them with food<br>
     and stuff so that's really nice. He would call me and tell me “You know<br>
     what? I'm good”. I'm over here in this place where it's like a house of<br>
     the migrant kind of thing and it's really nice.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: That's awesome.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : That wasn't around when I got deported. I'll tell you that<br>
     much. None of that stuff was around, and I'm glad too because it made<br>
     me strong character and a strong willed. In a way it was a blessing<br>
     that there was nothing there for me to enjoy because that just made me<br>
     more hungry in the sense that it made me more hungry for success and<br>
     more hungry to have my own back and to scratch my own back and to be<br>
     more self-reliant and have that self-resiliency to seek success for<br>
     myself.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Blessing in disguise.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Yes.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Then since we talked last, have you taken any classes or<br>
     enrolled in any education institution?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I lost my INE, and I haven't found a way or people to help<br>
     me get it again. I know Israel and his team do that a lot, but I<br>
     haven't been in touch with their team because for the same reason that<br>
     I'm doing management duties and I'm doing level three stuff at<br>
     CompuCom, I haven't even had a chance to get my own documents in check,<br>
     but I know that there's an institution that helps people revalidate<br>
     their studies. I haven't done that. I wish to do so, but I haven't<br>
     found time to first, find the two witnesses that I need to get my ID,<br>
     and moving forward, reach out to the people that do it. No I haven't,<br>
     but I've taken certifications necessary for my work that I have been<br>
     doing, and I've been educating myself in advanced Excel for doing pivot<br>
     tables for work and stuff.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: And you're currently working for pay?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Yeah, I'm working in _______ as a level three engineer<br>
     systems analyst. I guess that's what they call it. It's a, I guess<br>
     service experience senior analyst or whatever.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: How many hours do you work for them?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I lost track. I'm almost always connected because of my<br>
     huge responsibilities. I'm technically supposed to be doing a 48-hour<br>
     work shift, but sometimes I'm doing 80 or 90. Sometimes a 100.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Per?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Per Week, yes. But the reason being is because one, I'm<br>
     very passionate about what I do and two, I'm very hungry for knowledge<br>
     and wisdom, so whenever the company needs somebody to, let's say “We<br>
     need somebody to do this,” I raise my hand and say “I want to do it. I<br>
     want to do it, I want to train them” because I've actually been<br>
     training people for the company as well as doing my own work, as well<br>
     as doing management, as well as being the 24/7 contact, as well as<br>
     being the VIP contact.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I'm always raising my hand. Who wants to do this? Me, but<br>
     there's no overtime. I don't care. I want to do it. That's the way I<br>
     am. I do that many hours because I choose to do it. They do pay me<br>
     overtime here and there when it's something that's just, you know what,<br>
     “we need you to go on your day off and train these guys”, yeah by all<br>
     means. Give me. Let me have it. I want to do it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: What is the wage?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I'm making 18,000 a month plus about 4,000.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Pesos?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It's 18,000 pesos plus an additional 4,000 in, what do you<br>
     call the restaurant?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Commission? Tips?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : No, it's not a commission. It's about three 3000 for, what<br>
     is that? It's a restaurant thing where you have a special card and you<br>
     can slide it and it's particularly just for restaurant use. Like a<br>
     resto pass. That's what they call it. It's like a Sedexo card. In<br>
     Spanish they call it vales de despensa. I don't know how to translate<br>
     that. It's a pantry bonus I guess.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Okay, so they pay for your food expenses and that sort of<br>
     thing.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It's a card where you can go and use it on particular<br>
     venues but I just exchange it for money. Let's say out of the 18 that<br>
     I'm making, that's before taxes I'm making probably 22, and then maybe<br>
     out of those 22 from the 18 you take away taxes so I'm making maybe<br>
     anywhere between 15 to 18 after taxes which isn't bad but isn't good.<br>
     Well, in my eyes I can be making a lot more, but I'm very satisfied<br>
     with what I’m making now, but, probably in the next two, three years<br>
     I'm going to obtain that manager position. I know that for a fact<br>
     because I've been doing management duties for about six months already.<br>
     I know for a fact that when the manager position comes around, I'm<br>
     going to be very highly prepared for it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I don't have the school to back it up but I have a lot of<br>
     experience and the thing with me is that I have a lot of people skills,<br>
     so I know that it's going to put me way up there in the candidate list.<br>
     I almost have it assured, but there's always competition. I'm not the<br>
     only one that does his job. I'm not the only one that has a good<br>
     background, so if it doesn't come the first time it will come the<br>
     second time or the third time. At least I'll be ready for the questions<br>
     because let's say if I do not make it the first time, I'll be well<br>
     prepared for the questions so the second or third time I'll just<br>
     dominate the interview.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Sounds like you've got it down.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Yes. And it's just going to keep getting higher and better<br>
     from there. Once I obtain manager, cu I'm going to go for senior<br>
     manager, once I get senior manager, I'm going to go for director and if<br>
     I can, go to vice president. It's just a matter of time. It depends.<br>
     Depends how long am I allowed to be on this earth.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Who do you currently live with? Friends, parents, siblings-<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Alone.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Cool. Which of the following, I'm just going to read a list of<br>
     relatives and which of the following live in Mexico. Is it<br>
     grandparents-<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Dead.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Parents, siblings, children, partner, aunts, uncles or<br>
     cousins?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Right now at this point in time I only have a few aunts<br>
     living in the city. I have two aunts living in ______ and the rest are<br>
     either in _____ or in a little Pueblito called _____ where my mom's<br>
     from. Overall, I'd have to say - all my grandparents are dead, my<br>
     father's dead, my mom and my brothers are in the States and everybody<br>
     else is here with two aunts being here in the city.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Do you talk to your aunts and uncles who are in Mexico?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Seldomly due to the fact that I have a very huge focus on<br>
     my career, and they have their stuff going on. It's not that… they<br>
     treat me well when I go there, but they're not aligned with my goals<br>
     and my way of life so I tend to just align myself with people that are<br>
     also aligned. Even with friends. I know a lot of people in the city, so<br>
     I tend to not talk to them as much anymore because I'm so focused on my<br>
     job and my goals. Where I live currently there's a bunch of English<br>
     speakers, big time. Two of them actually work with me. For instance,<br>
     people in my radius, within a five-kilometer radius, there's a bunch of<br>
     English speakers in my neighborhood. But I talk to them just like maybe<br>
     we'll grab a beer, we'll have some pizza and that's it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Friends and family, I tend to shut them off because<br>
     they're not aligned with my mental goals and my preparations. I know to<br>
     some it can come out as cold, but I want to get somewhere in life and I<br>
     want to get there as fast as possible. Not because I'm in a hurry, but<br>
     I know what I'm capable of doing and I want to devour the world as it<br>
     is. That's just the type of guy that I am. I'm devouring the world as<br>
     it comes.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: For sure. Are you in contact with your mom in the United<br>
     States?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : All the time. Very frequently. I talk to her weekly. There<br>
     was a time where I would talk to her almost daily. Nowadays I talk to<br>
     her at least once a week with the average being maybe twice a week on<br>
     her days off because she rests Tuesday and Wednesday. So I talk to her<br>
     Tuesday in the morning or afternoon or sometimes in the evening<br>
     depending if I have too much work I'll just call her when I'm done. But<br>
     her and I, we have a lot of communication.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Great. Are you considering returning to the States? Yes or no?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : That's a difficult question. If it was in my hands to<br>
     return freely without any problems, I'd come and go as I would please.<br>
     But rules and laws prohibit me from doing so. In order for me to be<br>
     eligible for me to go back to the States, even with the visa, I have to<br>
     submit a pardon request and I have to wait for my 10-year penalty,<br>
     which I will gladly do and eventually I will follow up, because for the<br>
     senior manager position that I aspire for I need to be visa eligible,<br>
     so it's going to take time and money. A lot of money. I'm looking at<br>
     about maybe a hundred thousand pesos more or less for the lawyer and<br>
     the fees and all that. But it's definitely something... I'm going to do<br>
     it, not because I want to go back to the States and live there, but<br>
     because I want to have more opportunities in Mexico and having a visa<br>
     just opens a lot more doors.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : The fact that the job… it would make me thrive more at<br>
     work that's the only reason why I would get a visa and to see my mom,<br>
     that's it. The only two reasons. And my mom is going to get her papers<br>
     so at the end of the day it doesn't really matter if I get my visa or<br>
     not. She can come here anytime, and if I get it phenomenal, if I don't<br>
     get it, I'm not going to cry over it. There's Canada, there's Europe,<br>
     there's Australia, there's Asia. I closed my doors in one place? Yes.<br>
     I'm not sad about it. It doesn't hurt me, it's just difficult in the<br>
     sense that I have to put a lot of money and effort to be eligible to<br>
     visit the place again, so I really have to consider whether or not it's<br>
     beneficial for me instead of investing those 100,000 in that, and I<br>
     could start a small business here and maybe just thrive here. Who<br>
     knows.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It's a difficult decision in the sense of the amount of<br>
     money that I would take for me to be eligible once more and my thing<br>
     wasn't a light thing. It was drug sales, and they really dislike that.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: They take it seriously. Well that was a survey. Now we can<br>
     just continue on-<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Sure, I'd like some more coffee after this.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: For sure.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I don't think this is going to be enough. I'm sorry.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: You can have as much as you like.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : As you can tell by my dark circles around my eyes. I'm<br>
     just constantly working all day, every day nonstop. I'm a workaholic at<br>
     heart. I think probably this got me started. A nice little warm up.<br>
     Coffee.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: All right, sounds good. We'll definitely get more. Last year,<br>
     or can you remind me how long you've been in Mexico.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It's been actually this month, it's my anniversary on the<br>
     3rd of June. There you go again with the threes and sixes and nines on<br>
     the 3rd of June of 2011 is the day I arrived to this beautiful city. I<br>
     remember like if it was yesterday. I remember that it was around three<br>
     in the morning. See the three, see the significance of the threes. It<br>
     was around three in the morning actually when I woke up. It was a<br>
     nightmare to me at the time it was very hurtful seeing myself in the<br>
     window because since the airplane, the lights were on, I looked at<br>
     myself and it was like the mirror reflection because the lights, I saw<br>
     myself and I was like, damn, this is for real. This is really<br>
     happening.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I'm arriving to the city. Wow. So, I'm landing, right?<br>
     When I look out from the window, I look and I see a tiny little bright<br>
     light in a sea of darkness, just somber, quiet, darkness. And I see<br>
     this super, super bright light in the distance. Super far away. I'm<br>
     like, what is that tiny dot? What is that? Why is it so bright? What's<br>
     going on? Where am I arriving? Why is it so light in a sea of darkness?<br>
     So about 30 minutes go by, 3:30, I start seeing how that tiny light<br>
     becomes a monstrosity, just huge city, far away. This beacon of light<br>
     just shining out to me, and I'm like, I think I'm here. I think I'm<br>
     actually here.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Suddenly, I started feeling dreadful. I started feeling a<br>
     dread, just very anxious, very nervous, very sad, very, just, I don't<br>
     know, just a rush of emotions. Just going through my head just like, Uh<br>
     oh, I think I'm here. I think I'm here. I think I’m here.This is really<br>
     happening. I started feeling very nervous, very… it's even hard to<br>
     describe what I was feeling. It was intense. It was so intense. I was<br>
     just expecting the worst. When the City finally starts manifesting<br>
     because we start getting closer and closer, I'm like, this is a monster<br>
     of a city.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : This is a huge city. The lights were just super bright<br>
     because I hadn't slept the whole night because I was just so nervous. I<br>
     was just peeking out, peeking out. I was super anxious. Here I am<br>
     landing in this monstrosity of a city, and I looked down, I'm like, man<br>
     this is just, I'm not ready for this. I don't want to land. I don't<br>
     want to be here. But then I'm like, "You know what? you earned this,<br>
     you earned this trip, take it." We finally land. It was around four,<br>
     almost four, and I was lost. I was lost. I was depressed, I was lost. I<br>
     was mad at myself, and I didn't want to accept it. I want to just go<br>
     back and not be here. It was a scary looking city. It was overwhelming.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: How long ago was that again?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Eight years and a few, eight let's say, what's today's<br>
     date? It's nine right? It was exactly eight years and six days ago.<br>
     Eight years and six days ago. Exactly. And maybe what time is it? It's<br>
     12 no it's one. I arrived here at four so-<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Couple hours.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Couple hours. My cousin was somewhere, I had a phone from<br>
     the States that was working in TJ because obviously TJ is really close<br>
     to the States. I had a ___number and when the day that I got released,<br>
     my aunt actually pulled up. My aunt pulled up in a Range Rover, bawling<br>
     status, “Here's your stuff” and she still had the nerve to show up and<br>
     just toss me my stuff, “Here you go”. I'm like, "That's it?" They<br>
     hugged me a little bit, but she showed up in a Range Rover, here you<br>
     go, here's your 100 bucks and that's it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Deal with it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Deal with it. They were a bit pissed. I know they were<br>
     pissed. They were sad, but they were pissed also because it was just<br>
     like, You messed up. You're about to graduate. You're getting your<br>
     chemical engineering degree going on. Why'd you do it, man? Not mad.<br>
     And I was hungry, I've been hungry since I was 14 years old. I needed<br>
     money and working in the yards wasn't cutting it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I was a double full-time student almost. I was taking 20<br>
     to 24 units a semester. I needed money to live. I needed money to<br>
     sustain my school. I needed money for clothes. I needed money for<br>
     everything. Working weekends wasn't going to cut it. I was in school<br>
     from eight in the morning to 10 at night, almost daily with Fridays<br>
     being the exception. I was like, you know what, I'm doing two majors<br>
     this isn't cutting it, and “you guys weren't helping me, I'm not<br>
     blaming you, but just understand why it was done.” “But you could have<br>
     spoken.” I spoke a lot of times that this wasn't cutting it. I was<br>
     frustrated. It happened.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Last year, I don't really think we talked a lot about how it<br>
     was like coming back. If you want to talk to me about that-<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : The first two years were just severe depression, if you<br>
     want me to go in detail about it. It was very severe depression to the<br>
     point where I just lost the will to live the first year. It was just<br>
     bad. Although I was very strong, willed and sought opportunities for<br>
     myself. It was just coming home and just feeling guilty about it. Just<br>
     laid back on my bed and just sometimes crying myself to sleep because I<br>
     was alone, and I still wouldn't get over the fact that I was here and<br>
     it was just coming home to a barren house, to a barren apartment. I<br>
     didn't even have a bed. I slept on a bunch of blankets and clothes.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It was just coming to an empty house. I didn't even have<br>
     curtains, but I was proud so I didn't want to be with my aunts anymore<br>
     because they were just so oppressive that I just, it's either this or<br>
     going back to my aunts and just being oppressed big time and being told<br>
     what to do, what to wear, how to talk, when to talk, when to eat. It's<br>
     either I live in a tyranny or I'm free, but I have nothing so I chose<br>
     nothing.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: And you felt guilty about how you got back to Mexico?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I felt guilty because my mom was destroyed. That's why I<br>
     felt guilty. My mom was just crying and constantly feeling very guilty<br>
     because she was not able to provide the life that I wanted. We lived in<br>
     a very humble home, and it wasn't enough for me. I wanted things. I was<br>
     very materialistic in the States.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Why do you think that was?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I grew up around the rap culture. I grew up in a very<br>
     materialistic society and I think that I'm not the only one that lived<br>
     in that. I actually like flashy things. I don't know if you remember,<br>
     but the last time I came I had a huge chain. No. The second time I came<br>
     I had the huge chain. I had the medallion, I used to rock diamond<br>
     earrings and, well, I've been around people that were in car clubs.<br>
     ______ is just a place of a lot of money. Imagine an immigrant boy<br>
     growing up in ______. There's a lot of money there, and I would see my<br>
     surroundings and I see all these ballers and all these people in nice<br>
     SUV's and here I am just barely surviving. It's rough.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I'm glad I grew up in an environment like that because it<br>
     made me very hungry as a person. Extremely. To this day I don't stop<br>
     working because I want nice things.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: What happened with the medallion and the chain?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I ended up pawning it, and I never got it out because one,<br>
     I was just, there's been some hard times here and there, but I'm a very<br>
     proud person, so I always try to, always try to get myself up so I<br>
     don't go crying to my aunts or my mom and say, oh. I'd rather just,<br>
     there's an expression that I have. I'd rather just dug it out, just<br>
     live it out, ride it out and not go crying to people and beg for help.<br>
     I'm very proud of that.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: What was the hardest part about coming back to Mexico?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : My mom. My mom's pain. My mom's pain was my pain. If it<br>
     wouldn't have been for my mom, I probably would have probably just been<br>
     all right. But the fact that she was in pain meant I was in pain. I<br>
     still cry about it sometimes. I still do.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Do you talk to her a lot?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Yes, but the pain is still there. I know she's lying when<br>
     she says that it doesn't hurt, but it still hurts her and it still<br>
     hurts me. But it's gotten better.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: And she's in line to get her papers on track?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Yeah.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Her citizenship or residency?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Residency. She has a work permit right now.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Did you ever qualify for DACA when you were in the States? I<br>
     can't remember.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It's too early. That was not in my time. I got deported in<br>
     2011 and that all started happening right after I left. It was a bad<br>
     time for me to have gotten deported. Wrong place, wrong time.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: When you talk about having hard times here in Mexico, can you<br>
     tell me a little bit more about them?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Times where… unemployment and there's times where you<br>
     don't get a job right away. You got to just live with one meal a day<br>
     and just make your last paycheck stretch for even three, six, nine<br>
     months, however long it is.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Do you feel you've ever been discriminated against here for<br>
     being a returning immigrant?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : At first. The fact that you don't speak English properly<br>
     or you don't know the ways or you don't know how to get to a place and<br>
     you have to ask somebody. Sometimes people give you wrong directions on<br>
     purpose or sometimes people just mess with you.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: So you had a struggle with Spanish?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : At first. But I dominated that pretty quickly because I<br>
     don't like being weak and I don't like being, I guess you can say<br>
     incompetent. So I dominated that pretty quickly. I had to.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: I remember you talking last year about being called the<br>
     “godfather” in the States and not letting people mess with you, that's<br>
     something that stuck with me for this past year.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : People from the States still refer to me by that nickname.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Do you keep in contact with your friends from over there?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Yeah, I actually have a few of them on Facebook. The<br>
     people that I used to bust missions with and be in the party scene<br>
     with, because I was really into the party scene. I actually still have<br>
     a lot of the photos and not too long ago there was a meme where it<br>
     says, what were you doing in high school? I was dominating the parties<br>
     and I actually posted that. I had a relentless ... [aside] Hi. Excuse<br>
     me. Can I have another cup of that coffee please? Thank you. [to<br>
     Claudia] I had relentless dominance over the party scene, and I don't<br>
     want to sound arrogant, but I tell you not in a way that that like a<br>
     proud King tells you but I tell you that because my name Cuauhtémoc is<br>
     the name of an emperor. It's the name of a Mexica emperor and I like to<br>
     say Mexica instead of Aztec because that's a proper name. Most people<br>
     think Aztec is a proper name, but it's actually Mexica.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It's the name of the last Mexica emperor that valiantly<br>
     and ruthlessly fought against Cortes without any iron, without any<br>
     guns, without any cannons. His people fought to the very end, and when<br>
     Cortes sat him down and told him you know what? You better tell us<br>
     where the gold is or I'm going to burn you. He said do what you need to<br>
     do, but I'm not going to sell my people out. That's basically what<br>
     happened to me because I had a small empire and when I got caught with<br>
     the drugs and stuff, they asked me, "Who's your dealer? Give us the<br>
     information. We'll let you go." "No, I got in this myself. Do what you<br>
     need to do. Take me to wherever you need to take me. Give me the years<br>
     you need to give me. But I did this to benefit myself, and I'm not<br>
     going to give you any names and do your worst." So here I am. Here I<br>
     am.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Eight years later.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Eight years later. [aside] Thank you. Appreciate that.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Tell me more about the past year per se. What has been going<br>
     on, all that.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Ever since I started studying about, because I'm a<br>
     chemical engineer at heart. Let me show you a few things. Ever since I<br>
     started looking at these videos - go ahead actually browse through it.<br>
     Ever since I started aligning myself with certain frequencies and<br>
     listening to actual music and positive affirmations and self-<br>
     programming, I've seen a significant change in the way - there's<br>
     actually this thing called god frequency, and the monks actually<br>
     meditate under there's an ohm that they chant, and that ohm is meant to<br>
     be voiced in a particular frequency.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Whenever you align yourself, your voice, your mind, you<br>
     align yourself to a celestial frequency, great things start to happen<br>
     because whenever you're tuning into a negative and bad frequency, a lot<br>
     of things like that just start to surround your life. But when you<br>
     change the frequency, and you align yourself with positive mentality<br>
     with positive affirmations, positive people, positive music, positive<br>
     frequencies, and just being in tune with the god frequency, being in<br>
     tune with life frequency because there's more than one. There's the God<br>
     frequency, there's life frequency, there's just a bunch of really nice<br>
     frequencies there. There's healing frequencies that people that<br>
     practice Reiki. They also tune into those frequencies.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Those frequencies have really just helped me get my life<br>
     together. They have really helped me heal. I would say that I'm still<br>
     broken because I haven't mastered myself fully yet, but at least I'm<br>
     healed. I'm broken but just with like, maybe like a stitch. It's there.<br>
     It's a huge open wound still because the pain is still there but it<br>
     doesn't hurt anymore like it used to. It's just the pain that maybe<br>
     when you sprain an ankle and eventually you walk it off. Like you step<br>
     on it, and it's just pulses but it's not to the point where you can't<br>
     walk, you can walk, you can do stuff and it's just that tiny pulse it<br>
     just shoots up and you even sometimes even step real hard so it goes<br>
     away. That's what I do.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Do you feel your I guess connection with the frequency has<br>
     increased a lot, intensified a lot more in the past year?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Well, I think the proper term of intensify, I think it<br>
     would be more of, it has facilitated that I've aligned myself with the<br>
     frequencies. I'd see this more of a when you have a radio and you turn<br>
     the knob and sometimes it sounds very unclear. You could still hear the<br>
     music, but it sounds very static and weird. The message just keeps<br>
     getting a little clearer each time. It's not a leap where from one day<br>
     to the next you're just this super highly conscientious and elevated<br>
     being, but I'm getting there.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I'm not seeking complete abstinence of desire because I<br>
     know that in order for you to be fully in tune with those frequencies,<br>
     you need to relinquish meat, you need to relinquish desire, you need to<br>
     relinquish sex and all that stuff. I'm not ready to give that up yet<br>
     because meat by itself has a lot of negativity attached to it because<br>
     the slaughtering of the animal, the energy that the animal leaves<br>
     behind, the fact that the animal went through a very gruesome murder<br>
     and the fact that the animal surrounded by a lot of dirtiness, a lot of<br>
     just very horrible things.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I love meat. I'm not going to lie. I love meat. I love<br>
     pork. I know pork itself isn't very healthy, so I'm not at that point<br>
     where I want to just completely relinquish my way of life for elevation<br>
     because I know the yogis do that. I'm not ready to give a lot of things<br>
     up yet but I am aligning myself to the frequencies in that sense that I<br>
     tend to try to throw out positive vibes. If I see somebody mad dogging<br>
     me in the Metro, you know what? Bless you, hopefully God or whomever<br>
     you pray to cures that hating heart and that's it, and I'll just be on<br>
     my merry way. I try to not allow those things to affect me or consume<br>
     me.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: You pretty much said that everything has gotten better,<br>
     social, economic, job, security and all that. Can you just tell me a<br>
     little bit more about that sort of thing? How it's gotten better and<br>
     how do you feel? Where are you at right now?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Well, it's gotten better in the sense that I have a lot of<br>
     peace of mind, and I forgave myself for a lot of things. I forgave<br>
     myself for all the pain that I've inflicted upon my family. I forgave<br>
     myself for all the mistakes that I've made throughout the past. I think<br>
     the number one thing and healing is forgiving yourself. In that sense,<br>
     I don't carry those burdens anymore. They still sting here and there<br>
     from time to time. But it's something that I've let go of and I've<br>
     mastered. Not 100% but I've mastered, and I feel great about having<br>
     that in the past. In that sense, I walk without holding onto those very<br>
     heavy things.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: To the baggage.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : The baggage, there you go. I don't have that baggage<br>
     anymore with me and that has really given me the opportunity to expand<br>
     internally, and being able to heal those hurtful things with positive<br>
     things. The void that's inside me, the empty void that was once filled<br>
     with rage and sadness and depression, that void is being regenerated<br>
     with self-love, self-empowerment, and overall feelings of wellbeing. So<br>
     to start off internally, that's where the change has been done, mainly.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : In terms of external things like the home at work. I'm<br>
     running an apartment all to myself which I am furnishing all to myself.<br>
     I've gone through numerous changes. I've left a lot of furniture<br>
     behind, I've left a lot of things behind in numerous places,<br>
     distributed. I don't care because I am no longer as materialistic as I<br>
     used to be. Let's say in the house that I was living at prior to living<br>
     in where I am, I left furniture behind. I left a lot of nice things<br>
     behind so I didn't even care. I was like, keep everything. I left stuff<br>
     behind with my roomies and I don't care.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Do you think that being back in Mexico has made you want to<br>
     turn your life around in that way and be less materialistic?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : What has fueled my change is not Mexico. What has fueled<br>
     my change is an awakening, an internal awakening, and the realization<br>
     of my potential as an infinite being. That has fueled me. Not Mexico,<br>
     not my mom, not my surroundings, but just my realization that I am an<br>
     infinite being and that I'm practically the universe manifesting itself<br>
     in three dimensions and a vessel made of flesh, AKA human<br>
     consciousness, that is what fuels me every day. The fact that I'm<br>
     infinite and the fact that I've proven that we are infinite because you<br>
     go into a tier three campaign as a 1.5, and I've been first-place<br>
     nonstop.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : And the fact that I've been able to very quickly absorb<br>
     and dominate every test that has been bestowed upon me, it further<br>
     confirms my infiniteness and my role as a superior being not superior<br>
     in the sense that I'm better than you, but superior being because of<br>
     the consciousness and the realizations that I have. We're pretty much<br>
     demigods, we're semi gods. Why? Because we have the ability to create<br>
     and destroy just like a god can create and destroy. I too can do that.<br>
     Maybe not in that grand scale where I can create celestial bodies, but<br>
     quantum mechanics talks a lot about how our micro thoughts have a macro<br>
     effect on the universe.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : And that has been tested and proven time and time again<br>
     with a lot of experiments. One of them being, the water freezing<br>
     experiment by the Japanese where they speak emotions and thoughts into<br>
     freezing water and they literally see a visual representation of that<br>
     thought in the snowflake that water becomes. If you are hateful and<br>
     evil towards the water, the water manifests very ugly looking<br>
     snowflakes. Whereas if you treat the water with love and care and speak<br>
     very nice things to it, it manifests into beautiful snowflakes. This<br>
     isn't something that I'm just speaking, I'm inferring or I'm guessing.<br>
     No, this is something that has been proven by both science and religion<br>
     and I'm just simply replicating it with my actions.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : This goes further beyond Mexico. This is just my<br>
     realization as a powerful being that I am, and I am a living testament<br>
     of the powerful being that I am on a day to day basis.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: In what ways do you think that having lived in the United<br>
     States all that time shaped who you are today and the beliefs that you<br>
     have?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I am very hungry. I am very relentless and I chase my<br>
     goals with almost a reckless pursuit. There is a book that I shaped my<br>
     life around called Frankenstein. Nothing to do with the movie at all.<br>
     There's even an essay that I actually read a lot called… there is an<br>
     essay by some guy in some university I don't even know, but the point<br>
     being is what was Frankenstein? The reckless pursuit of knowledge.<br>
     Because what the scientists did was he chopped down his moral and<br>
     ethical limits to obtain a goal because at the end of the day, morally<br>
     and ethically speaking, that's wrong, but he achieved something that<br>
     was thought impossible. He played God, and he obtained it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : You know what the problem was? He created something ugly<br>
     in the eyes of society because Frankenstein was ugly looking. He had a<br>
     beautiful heart at first, but due to society's rejection, Frankenstein<br>
     turned evil because he was rejected, and all he wanted was just to fit<br>
     in. Frankenstein ended up just blowing up. I am Frankenstein in this<br>
     sense. I have been shaped and molded by the States and Mexico. I may be<br>
     ugly on the outside, but my intentions are sincere and pure on the<br>
     inside. If society doesn't want to accept him for who I am, let them<br>
     be. At the end of the day, I don't need anybody's approval.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : So yes, I am the scientist, and I am the Frankenstein<br>
     both. I'm not saying that I'm going to chop down my ethical and moral<br>
     limits because I do have limits, but I'm going to do whatever it takes<br>
     to get to where I'm at, and I ain't going to also become that product,<br>
     but the difference is here is that, one I'm not going to disregard my<br>
     moral and ethical views and two, I'm not going to go berserk on society<br>
     and because I'm not welcome. I don't need to be welcomed. I just need<br>
     to be respected. That's it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Neither. I consider myself an infinite being that has no<br>
     nationality nor borders. I consider myself a being of light. I consider<br>
     myself and the universe manifesting itself in three dimensions, a part<br>
     of it. That's what I consider myself. I'm beyond the whole<br>
     “Mexican-American”. Borders are imaginary, implemented by humans<br>
     therefore, I don't consider myself neither.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: I think that's my favorite answer that I've heard to that<br>
     question so far.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Good.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: If you could have stayed in the United States, what do you<br>
     think you might have done?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : That's a hard question. I think about that. I don't know.<br>
     I don't know how to answer that. Because there was so many versions of<br>
     me in the States. There was the quiet boy that just wanted to finish<br>
     school because of his mom's expectations, but then I was very heavy in<br>
     the party scene. I was chasing chemical engineering. I don't know. It<br>
     could be one of five. Maybe I just would have gone quietly and just<br>
     graduated and maybe worked in a pharmacy because that's what more or<br>
     less... I wanted to do pharmaceutical, chemical engineering. I could<br>
     probably have followed my father's footsteps and probably be the CEO of<br>
     that business and maybe would have made that expand.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I probably would be drug dealing probably, very heavily<br>
     doing so maybe doing some pretty heavy drug dealing, or I probably<br>
     would have gotten into the party scene and done some pretty heavy club<br>
     promoting. Maybe just do some heavy club promoting for the hottest<br>
     clubs in Hollywood or something or maybe just be lost and destroyed and<br>
     be in mayhem, being in the streets, doing mayhem and being destructive<br>
     and carcinogenic to society. I say that because I used to do a lot of<br>
     partying and just breaking into warehouses and partying and just trying<br>
     to get money. One of the five.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : The most probable out of those five probably be either the<br>
     chemical engineering or there's a sixth one actually manufacturing<br>
     drugs. Illegal or illegal, a Breaking Bad type of thing. Some shady lab<br>
     somewhere and just-<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Doing what you got to do.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Doing what, well not doing what I got to do because I<br>
     don't got to sell drugs.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: That's true.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It's more of a thing that I like to do so I'll probably be<br>
     somewhere, and it wouldn't be just any drug. It wouldn't be harmful<br>
     drugs. They'd probably be LSD or DMT or ecstasy or something that is<br>
     not as bad like meth. If I were to choose a drug to manufacture it'd<br>
     probably be LSD, and just be like that one guy that they caught in some<br>
     lab somewhere out in the woods tripping and doing LSD and just being<br>
     the hippie guy not this super aggressive drug dealer, but more this<br>
     hippie guy. Just peace and love man, just trying to bring the sixties<br>
     peaceful movement back. It's illegal, yeah, but the day I get caught<br>
     just like, peace and love, dude. You know what I'm saying? Just vibe<br>
     with it.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: That'd be a hit at my college.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Actually I've sold LSD before. Mass scale and you surround<br>
     yourself with really cool people and it's not like, oh man, I got to<br>
     get rich quick or die trying kind of thing it's more like, you're<br>
     making money off of it, but it's just really chill people. I even used<br>
     to take LSD with my clients and I wouldn't consider them my clients<br>
     like you would because I've sold meth, I sold crack too. So it's way<br>
     different. Sometimes the crackheads just, they're very bad to deal<br>
     with. They'd be bringing just whatever. They can sometimes even their<br>
     own clothes, I’ll sell… I got some shoes. All right, shoes. I actually<br>
     did that myself once. Remember when I was partying and I ran out of<br>
     drugs and I had some nice Jordans and I, you know what? How much you<br>
     give me for these Jordans?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Give me a few grams for the Jordans. That was bad, but I<br>
     admit it, I did it. I know that's bad, just selling it or consuming it,<br>
     it's just horrible. Very bad vibes to it. Just people just get sucked<br>
     up. So I rather if I was back in the States, I'd probably just be<br>
     fabricating some really super high quality LSD and just tripping with<br>
     the people, being with the people, sometimes even going out into a<br>
     campfire and saying “Take it, but just let go” and probably even doing<br>
     some therapy with it too. Like “Hey man you know what, I'm here for<br>
     you. I know I'm, you're dealing and everything, but just come over,<br>
     we'll go into a cabin, we can trip out and just be cool and just be at<br>
     peace and get in touch with nature” and that's sort of thing.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Do you think if you were still in the States you wouldn't have<br>
     been able to-<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I probably would be super powerful in the States actually,<br>
     but it'd be more of a selfish thing because I was very power hungry in<br>
     the States. That's why my nickname, “the godfather” rose and fell<br>
     because I was a very proud person, and it was more of a power thing,<br>
     power struggle than anything. Kind of like when you're in a gang and<br>
     you fight for turf and stuff. The part seems very similar but with way<br>
     less violence. I think that I'd be kinda like this power-hungry dude.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Now that you've been back in Mexico, I know you've been here<br>
     for eight years but still, what do you like to do? What would you like<br>
     to do? What are your dreams?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Eventually just detach from society and go live far away<br>
     in my cabin and be self-efficient and just live off grid in a nice<br>
     place obviously have a couple of acres to myself and be a<br>
     self-sustained person. Just live off.. There's a quote from Of Mice and<br>
     Men. Have you read it?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Yes.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Live off the fat of the land. What they chased I like to<br>
     have that just live off the fat of the land. Have like Of Mice and Men,<br>
     just a happy finale. Just get out of here, get out of the toxicity of<br>
     the city and just live in some remote location. A very, what's the word<br>
     I'm looking for? A very, what's the term called when the land is rich?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Fertile.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Fertile, just live in some very fertile place and maybe<br>
     grow my own stuff and maybe have a few goats and just slaughter them<br>
     when necessary with the balance and maybe just sell some too just to<br>
     exchange. Live in a place where, maybe even an autonomous place,<br>
     because there's a lot of places in Mexico that are autonomous. Just<br>
     screw the law, screw exploitation. I'll just live with like-minded<br>
     people like myself and just get out of here and just have my nice,<br>
     beautiful cabin and maybe grow some fruit, grow some veggies, and have<br>
     a few animals and just maybe have friends that do the same thing and<br>
     just get away from here and just not be here part of this toxic<br>
     environment and just be away.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : But that's going to take a lot of money and time and just<br>
     be out to myself. Maybe a hermetic lifestyle, but not in the sense that<br>
     the yogis do or the Shaolin not to that level, but I'll still party.<br>
     I'll still probably have girlfriends and stuff and have that lust<br>
     aspect still there. Because I know that Shaolin and yogis, zero sex,<br>
     zero meat, zero everything. I'm not ready for that yet. Just let's go<br>
     camp out, and be like a permanent camp out just get away from here. Get<br>
     away from this pollution and believe me, people say, “oh, Mexico city<br>
     has pollution.” Yes. So does LA. Get out of here with that.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : It's not just Mexico. Open your eyes and realize that<br>
     every big city has these problems. Every big city has rats. Every big<br>
     city has homeless. Every big city has pollution. Every big city has<br>
     black water so get out of here when you say it's Mexico. It's not<br>
     Mexico. It's when you want to judge. Look at your own big city first<br>
     and then come at me and tell me, “oh, it's Mexico's ugly. Mexico's<br>
     dirty”. Well, you haven't looked hard enough. You haven't gone to<br>
     Bosque de Chapultepec. You haven't gone to Cerro de la Estrella. You<br>
     haven't gone to the nice parts. Look internally before you can<br>
     criticize. That's my motto of life.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Now we get to the last few questions and they're a little bit<br>
     more reflexive.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Sure.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: What can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants<br>
     integrate into Mexican society?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Give them tools and not money. Show them the way. Allow<br>
     them the capability of developing skills. If you give people money, you<br>
     make them worthless because they eventually become dependent on that<br>
     sometimes. Not everybody, but give people tools and not money. Teach<br>
     them things that will help them thrive in a society. Teach them things<br>
     like accounting, expenses, management of expenses, economics, teach<br>
     them how to have a trade, maybe construction, electrician. Help them<br>
     with school in the sense that, integrate them back into school.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : When I got here, it was very hard to integrate myself back<br>
     to school. I actually did a test in the UNAM to study English. What was<br>
     it? Enseñanza del Inglés, which translates to for non-English as<br>
     Spanish speakers, English teaching. So the girl, I still remember, it<br>
     was just horrible. When I went and I presented my high school diploma,<br>
     she just tossed it and she's like, "What the hell is this? This isn't a<br>
     document. This is worthless here. Didn't they tell you that you needed<br>
     to get revalidated?” I'm like, "No, that's what you're here for."<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I didn't say it like that messed up, but I'm like, “No,<br>
     isn't that what you're here for? To guide me?” “This is worthless. What<br>
     is this? I can't even read what this says.” That's why I haven't gone<br>
     back to school because it was just, man this is such a horrible system,<br>
     and this is supposed to be a prestigious school, and I know in the<br>
     States they do the same thing and Stanford and Yale, people get turned<br>
     down very horribly. It's not just a Mexican thing.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I point that out because I know people out there, they get<br>
     rejected from very prestigious places too, with very horrible attitude<br>
     because they raise their necks and say, oh, you're very prestigious<br>
     yeah, but where's your manners or you’re prestigious but where are your<br>
     manners? What's more important? Having prestige or treating someone<br>
     correctly, treating someone with the respect that they deserve. To me,<br>
     this is trash because you may be super prestigious, but at the end of<br>
     the day it's worthless because you're a horrible human being. Oh, well.<br>
     So I just said, “I don't need this. I don't need your institution. I<br>
     can educate myself and I've been educating myself for the last 10<br>
     years. I've been educating myself in the streets. No thank you. I don't<br>
     need this institution's teachings. If it's going to be like this from<br>
     the very beginning, I don't need this trash. You may be super good at<br>
     giving me book knowledge, but I have enough street knowledge to be able<br>
     to maneuver through life. I don't need this.” So I kind of just put me<br>
     off and I said, screw school. I don't need school. At the end of the<br>
     day school conditions you for a lot of things. So I'm like, I don't<br>
     need this conditioning.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I don't need this conditioning because at the end of the<br>
     day, school is a type of conditioning. I can think for myself, thank<br>
     you very much and if I need knowledge, I could just pick up a few books<br>
     and educate myself in the matter. So I don't need this. And it served<br>
     me well because with the high school diploma, I'm already going for<br>
     manager, and I'm sure that I'll get to director level with just the<br>
     high school diploma. Why? Because I'm very hungry, and I know I can do<br>
     it. I already programmed myself internally for me to have that director<br>
     position, so there's no doubt in my mind that I'm going to obtain it.<br>
     It's going to take time, maybe even 10 years, but I know that in 10<br>
     years, I'm going to have that position. I already made myself a<br>
     two-year plan, a five plan and a 10-year plan, and I'm going to invest<br>
     every single week and hour of my life to making sure that that's going<br>
     to happen.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: I know. I feel like it will.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I do too. Thank you for aligning yourself with my way of<br>
     thinking. Thank you. In that sense, that lady's rejection fueled me<br>
     that I'm like, if your institution isn't going to have me because of<br>
     my… I know there's processes to be followed and I respect them, but<br>
     when you treat somebody like that just because you have a nice, let's<br>
     say if you go to a Mexican, I don't know, like the taxes and somebody<br>
     treats you horribly just because they're like, “Oh, I'm a tax worker<br>
     and I have the power to approve or deny your things and I can just<br>
     treat you like crap.”<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I think that's an abomination. I think that's just<br>
     horrible. For you to consider yourself above somebody and just be able<br>
     to treat them like crap just because you have a position. Let's say if<br>
     a cop does that and they have done that to me too, where, “Oh well I'm<br>
     going to do what I want and at the end of the day it's my way or the<br>
     highway.” Cops have done that to me, but not just here in the States<br>
     too, Latino profiling. If you're that kind of human being, stay the<br>
     hell away from me. Go away. I don't want your negative and disgusting<br>
     vibe to affect me.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I know that I should be loving too but at the end of the<br>
     day, if I allow myself to be infected with that nastiness, I’m gonna –<br>
     I don't want to distribute that, I want to absorb it, yes, neutralize<br>
     it and just, go away be away from me. Blessings and love, but stay away<br>
     from me, and I don't want to be part of this institution. I don't want<br>
     to be part of your gigs. I don't want to be part of your shadiness,<br>
     stay away, and you stay over there in your corner of being hateful and<br>
     negative, and I'll stay in my corner being positive and assuring and<br>
     helpful and loving. Maybe at the end of the day, if that's what fills<br>
     your void by all means just do it over there. Stay away.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: What can the US government do to help Mexican deportees and<br>
     the families that they leave behind in the States?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Nothing. At the end of the day, we're in their country<br>
     following their laws, and if we decide to break them, it's our fault.<br>
     We are the ones that caused this upon us. I actually think that it's<br>
     wrong when you get deported for maybe having a super tiny little<br>
     ticket. I think it should be perhaps in consideration that I'm not<br>
     doing nothing wrong. Just give me a chance. Break me off. Okay. Yeah,<br>
     whatever. For things like drug dealing for what I did, the system's<br>
     fine. I'm the rotten one, at least I was. I don't have any issues with<br>
     the system. I have an issue maybe with being harsh with people that did<br>
     light things.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I think there should be more consideration for the light<br>
     criminals but for people like me that actually did things because of<br>
     power, because of greed, yeah man, let it be. Punish me however you<br>
     want to punish me. I don't care. I deserved it. It's fine. I was<br>
     intoxicating your people. I was breaking the law. Let's be fair about<br>
     it. You want to kick me out? Kick me the hell out. I don't mind. I'll<br>
     live with it. I'll swallow my pride. I'll live with the depression for<br>
     as long as I need to live with it because at the end of the day I was<br>
     doing something wrong and it deserves punishment because it's not like<br>
     you're doing something beneficial. You're intoxicating the masses with<br>
     drugs. Some of them very hard drugs. Let it be.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Why do you think that young Mexican men in the US turn to<br>
     crime and gangs?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I don't know. In my case it was because for very selfish<br>
     reasons. I cannot speak the same about everybody else. Some people<br>
     maybe don't have that love at home or that support at home. I would<br>
     like to think that the reason why young men, and I say young men, not<br>
     because I'm sexist or I generalize, but it's really hard to see a woman<br>
     do that because I guess they're more self-centered and more cautious.<br>
     You see young men do this because maybe, I don't know, it's just, I<br>
     can't really say.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Lack of love, lack of support, lack of opportunities. Not<br>
     in the sense that the government doesn't do them, but they close<br>
     themselves off. It's just hard to say. From the people that I've spoken<br>
     with, it's been mainly lack of love and lack of resources. Being an<br>
     illegal, just you don't have a social security, that immediately just<br>
     makes you inferior in that society. And yes, I said inferior. It makes<br>
     you inferior. You cannot purchase property, you cannot work<br>
     appropriately. You cannot do a lot of things. You're inferior in the<br>
     sense that you can't even get your own house. You need to ask somebody<br>
     to help you.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Why do you think that Mexicans have such a negative perception<br>
     of returning migrants?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Because they feel sometimes outshined or they feel that we<br>
     have a superiority complex, and we do have a superiority complex.<br>
     Because this is a number one complaint that I've gotten from people<br>
     after getting feedback. You guys feel you're the shit. You guys feel<br>
     you're superior. You guys feel you're all that because you've been in<br>
     the States. And I did. I actually did. It's not a lie. In my case, when<br>
     I came back, I'm like, man, my ego was way up there, although I was<br>
     depressed I used to feel I was the shit because one, where do I come<br>
     from? I used to have a lot of money. I used to have people under my<br>
     control. At one point I had 200 people under my power and control. I<br>
     actually came feeling pretty freaking hard, you know, I felt hard.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I felt powerful because I had people under my power, and<br>
     you get over here and you know what? People will try to talk down on<br>
     me. I'm like, “You know where I come from? You know what I've been<br>
     through? You know who you're talking to?” That's the vibe I gave off.<br>
     People used to tell me, you know what, when you got here, you used to<br>
     feel you were this big shit, you used to feel you were running the show<br>
     when in reality you had nothing. You were nobody. And that's true. I<br>
     was nobody and I had nothing. I thought about, I'm like, you're right.<br>
     I'm nothing and I have nobody, where are my houses? Where's the money?<br>
     Where's everything. Back home and they're my mother's things not mine.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I had a car but I crashed it. That made me think and I'm<br>
     like, these guys are actually right. We do come back thinking we're all<br>
     that. Most of us do because I know most of us were in gangs. Most of us<br>
     had something going on. We had a lot of money, we had cars so when you<br>
     come over here, and I actually had this problem once where you got<br>
     people from Polanco and nice parts thinking they're the shit and<br>
     they're like, wait a minute, you just barely have this tiny thing and<br>
     you feel you're all that and I had way more than you, so then you start<br>
     realizing I used to be like that. I used to feel I was this big<br>
     powerful person. But in reality I was nobody. That helped me have some<br>
     retro analysis and retrospective retro analysis. I'm like, do you know<br>
     what, these guys are right.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I came with a super big ego over here thinking, I'm all<br>
     cool I'm this super cool guy this and that so I just humbled down a<br>
     lot. It helped me humble down and I'm like, I've got to be more careful<br>
     about that because that's why people be hating on pochos because we<br>
     think we're the shit. Maybe not all of us, but I know a good majority.<br>
     If we were in gangs, we clash a lot with people like, "What the hell<br>
     are you looking at? What you looking at man?" That's the typical<br>
     response you get from a pocho because we're also taught in prison to be<br>
     very aggressive. We come from prison, we don't come from Disneyland, we<br>
     were in the system.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : We were very aggressive. We like to eat people just with<br>
     the stare. So if you see people dogging you, you're going to dog ‘em<br>
     back and you're like, "What the hell are you looking at?" It's a<br>
     defensive mechanism that we have. We're not in prison anymore, but we<br>
     feel we've got to still be protective of ourselves because we're<br>
     exposed. We're very much exposed because we speak English. People be<br>
     kidnapping us because they think that we have a lot of money, so we<br>
     have that vibe towards those to that we got to protect ourselves. I let<br>
     that go and I'm very friendly now. I smile at people. I speak English<br>
     in the streets too, but I do it more like, you know, and if people look<br>
     at me, I just smile at them and let them know that I'm not here to hurt<br>
     anybody, that I'm not here to fight anybody.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : So my vibe that I throw out is different now. But it took<br>
     me years to learn to calm down because when I first got here, I was on<br>
     the defensive 24/7 because I just came out of jail. It's not easy just<br>
     reincorporating into a society that right off the bat doesn't like you.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Well those are all the questions that I had. Now I just want<br>
     to give you the space, if you have anything else that you'd like to say<br>
     or add or anything else that you want me to know or anybody who's<br>
     listening to this to know this is really just -<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : Sure. For those of you that are listening, that have just<br>
     arrived here from the States, lose that superiority complex and humble<br>
     the hell down. That's all I got to say. Humble the hell down because<br>
     this society is going to eat you alive if you don't. And I lived<br>
     through that, very harshly. Very harshly. I had to fight a lot of<br>
     people. I had to swallow my pride way too many times, even with cops.<br>
     "You think you're all that, well, you know what, I'm going to put you<br>
     in jail for a long time. You better pay us some money or you're going<br>
     to be in for a pretty hard time." Just humble down. Throw some good<br>
     vibes out there. People are mean to you, just forgive them. Be as<br>
     Christ and Buddha and Krishna once did.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : People spit in your face, just bless them. It took me<br>
     several years for me to realize that sometimes fighting fire with fire<br>
     is just deadly and you end up bad and screwed and society just eats you<br>
     alive pretty harshly. They tear you apart, they want to see you down.<br>
     Instead of fighting fire with fire, fight fire with love and just try<br>
     to be at peace, smile, be peaceful, be positive. Even though maybe on<br>
     the inside you're rotting and sad and depressed, just try to give your<br>
     society your best face, even though maybe deep down you're hurting and<br>
     you're very sad. Just try to be as friendly as possible and as positive<br>
     as possible. That's it. I got nothing else to say.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Are you good with everything that you've told me?<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : I don't care… I don't care who hears it. At the end of the<br>
     day, it's just a humble opinion. It doesn't matter. I don't care if you<br>
     distribute this. I don't care if you put this on YouTube or whatever.<br>
     Doesn't matter. Let whomever wants to hear it, hear it. I'm nobody to<br>
     censor anything, so let it be. Let it be. Let it flow.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Claudia: Thank you.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
     Cuauhtémoc : You're welcome.<br>
   <\p></p>
