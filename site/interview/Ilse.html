 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: I was nine years old when I left Mexico to go to the United States<br>
   and basically left to reunite with my dad, who had left first. He saw an<br>
   opportunity and thought that it would be better for us. So, we packed our<br>
   things and then my mom, brother, and I, we went over to meet my dad.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Claudia: So, your dad, how long did your dad leave before you?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Two years. He was gone two years, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And did he go for economic reasons, for violence, for what</br>   specifically?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My dad left Mexico because of economic reasons. I've always been very</br>   mature, I've always been very aware of situations and what's going on, and</br>   I could tell that they were having a really hard time. So, my dad leaves, I</br>   stay with my mom and my brother, and yeah, it was hard because my mom</br>   alone, and things like that. But when my dad saw that it would be better</br>   for us to be over there, then I had no other option but to go with them.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Right. And do you remember your first day in the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Definitely! [Laughs]. You see, I was very angry from the time my mom</br>   told me that we had to leave Mexico. I was happy in Mexico. I have a lot of</br>   friends. I mean, I was only nine, but when you're nine, especially I think</br>   prior to this generation, you're very aware; at least, my mom always made</br>   me like that. She'd educated me to always be independent, and to always</br>   work hard at everything that I did. Obviously, at that time, I only went to</br>   school, right? But I also sold candy outside of my house so I could help my</br>   mom out a little bit, and I did so well in school, you know? I was so</br>   happy. I actually got a scholarship being in Mexico so I could keep going</br>   to school. I had straight A's. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And just out of nowhere, my mom coming up to me and saying, &quot;You're</br>   going to have to leave everything behind because we're going to go see your</br>   dad,&quot; that was just so shocking for me. And then, the whole journey to get</br>   to the US, which I'll never forget, and it's... I really pray that no</br>   nine-year-old ever has to go through that type of stuff. And then, getting</br>   to the US and not knowing anyone, and feeling totally out of place, and</br>   that first day was just so awful for me.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I know I was going to see my dad, but I was mad at my dad. I was mad</br>   because he made me go through all that, you know? So, my first day was so</br>   depressing. [Chuckles]. Although I tried to be happy for my parents because</br>   they were back together and because the family was back together, it was</br>   just so hard having to put up with all these changes. And the people, they</br>   look at you like if you were some kind of alien, because they've never seen</br>   many Latins, you know? Because we arrived to a really small community in</br>   North Carolina, and it was kind of, like, hillbillies, and they're pretty</br>   racist. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And, yeah, it was difficult, you know? I arrived to the US when it</br>   was still summer vacations, had two weeks left of vacations before I</br>   started going to school. But at least I had a chance to kind of accept it,</br>   in a way, and not feel as weird when I went to school, but still. It was a</br>   rough day, that one day.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, how did you cross the border with your mom and your</br>   siblings, with a coyote or did you just go by yourselves?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My dad had a friend in the States, and he had family in Guerrero. So,</br>   they're like, &quot;So you guys won’t come alone, meet up with that family, so</br>   you can all come over.&quot; And so, we met this family. It was a mom with a</br>   son—he's older than me for about two years, I think, and a girl. She was,</br>   at that time, she was like five, I think. She was so small.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My brother, he was seven at the time; so he's younger than me. And</br>   so, we met up in the city and we traveled to the border. The plan was to</br>   cross the border through the desert, all of us, with a coyote. But my</br>   brother and the little girl were too young. I was too young, too, but I</br>   didn't want to leave my mom. So, they separated us.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My brother went with this other family, who took care of him, and he</br>   crossed the border asleep in a car, which was... it was, I want to say</br>   easy, but after hearing his story, and how he had to suffer because these</br>   people hit him, and you know, abused him, because he couldn't do anything.</br>   People were just mean to him, and he was trying to protect the little girl,</br>   that then I understood that it wasn't easy for him, either.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And so, I was left behind with my mom, and the woman with her son,</br>   and we tried to cross the border through the desert. But it was awful. Even</br>   being at the border, waiting for the instructions to go ahead and start the</br>   journey, you know? And seeing so many people, and kids, and women... It was</br>   just so bad, you know? And those images are so vivid in my head still. Then</br>   after that, we were lost in the desert for three days. We ran out of water,</br>   we ran out of food, we ran out of everything; the coyote got lost. And</br>   there was a point... when it rains in the desert, it's so bad. Like, the</br>   thunderstorms are so, so bad. I'll never forget how this woman that was</br>   traveling with us, she was like hallucinating, I guess. It was so bad that</br>   it was raining and that there was a thunderstorm, and she thought that this</br>   one cactus was a person.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, she almost fell, so she thought she was going to grab onto</br>   someone, and she grabbed onto the cactus, and all her body was left with</br>   the little pikes. It was so bad, and then being lost…</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: We knew that they were going to be looking for us, obviously, or</br>   someone out there, so we just decided to wait. We waited it out. But before</br>   that, when it was raining, too... This was like a breaking point. There was</br>   a little, small creek, or little river, I guess you could say. When there's</br>   a thunderstorm and it's so dark, the thunder and then you're blacked out,</br>   you're blinded because of the light. And then, we lost track of the people.</br>   So, my mom and I got lost, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, we had to cross the little creek thing, and then my mom just</br>   slipped, and she was about to just keep going with the flow, and I was</br>   so... God is amazing, because I just can't believe He gave me the strength,</br>   you know, to save my mom. And this man came back for us. It's just so</br>   crazy, because who does that, you know? Who actually comes back to check on</br>   people when you have to take care of yourself? He helped us, we crossed it,</br>   but we were still lost. So, once again, we got to a point where, like,</br>   &quot;Okay, we're going to wait it out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But it rained so hard, and it was so hot, and we didn't have anything</br>   to eat or no water, and then I was just like blacked out. My mom says that</br>   I was gone for hours, and I was hallucinating, and literally, she thought I</br>   was going to die because it was so bad. So, the men that were with us, they</br>   went out looking for water or something, and they came across this—they</br>   said it was kind of like a pond kind of thing, but it was more like animal</br>   pee and, I don't know. So, they brought that back. My mom still had some</br>   limes, and my mom put lime in it, and she kept trying to get me water, and</br>   that's how like, I came back apparently. That's what she said. I don't</br>   remember anything about that.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, the coyote comes back, and he's like, &quot;Okay, I found out a way.</br>   We're good to go. We just got to keep walking.&quot; And that was the third day.</br>   And so, we kept walking, and I don't know where we hear the helicopter, and</br>   we hear the vans, and dogs, and they caught us, you know? We were so close.</br>   So close. And yet so far, literally.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, my mom just hugged me and she's like, &quot;The first thing you're</br>   going to do is you're going to run to the water.&quot; And, yeah. So, they</br>   caught us, and they said that we're violating US laws. They were so rude,</br>   so rude, I swear. And then they were like—I mean, I know I was a little</br>   girl, but I could understand what they were telling my mom, you know?—and</br>   they were just like, angry at her, too, because, &quot;How could you ever even</br>   think that your daughter... and she's so young...&quot; Apparently, I looked</br>   really sick. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And so, they just got us on the vans, and we went to the border</br>   prison. I was in prison for some time. Well, a day. [Chuckles]. And then,</br>   they took us back to the border and we had to start all over again. And it</br>   was just so sad and depressing, because the way we tried and everything we</br>   went through. That's why I was so angry when I got over there, because no</br>   human being should have to go through so much just so they could change</br>   their economic status, or just so they could run away from problems that</br>   you can't control.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, then we found out my brother was over there already. He was in</br>   Texas, I think; I don't even know. And my mom was like, &quot;We have to do it</br>   again. We have to try because your brother's over there, because your dad's</br>   already waiting for us.&quot; So, we didn't have any money, we didn't have</br>   anything, but the woman that we were with, she still had some money. So, we</br>   went over to a motel—and this is where I'm always grateful, and God is</br>   like... or I have this huge angel or something.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: The owners of the motel kind of heard the story when my mom was</br>   talking to my dad on the phone, and they said that they knew these people</br>   that faked the visas, or passports, and we could do it with them. And so,</br>   my mom talked to my dad and everything, and so, we were in training for two</br>   days, learning somebody else's identity. Name, everything, you have to know</br>   everything about the person, or at least the basics. It had to be in</br>   English, and I didn't know any English, or my mom didn't know any</br>   English—she's so bad at that. [Chuckles]. So we kept practicing and</br>   practicing, and I finally got it, right? So, I was good to go. And then my</br>   mom, she had a really, really hard time. Really hard time.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: The day came when we had to actually do it. A slight happy moment</br>   that I had was when they brought me clothes, because you have to look good,</br>   you have to look like you were normal, I guess. So, I got new clothes, and</br>   I was so happy because it had been three horrible weeks before that, and</br>   then just getting that was really nice. And the people were so nice to me,</br>   so nice.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, we get to the border on a van, and they're like, &quot;Okay, so,</br>   everyone's going to separate, everyone is going to go their own way, and</br>   we'll see you guys when we cross.&quot; So, we were on our own. And I remember</br>   asking my mom, &quot;Mom, just tell me a little bit, what's your story?&quot; And she</br>   just blacked out. She didn't know anything. Like, she just went blank, her</br>   mind went blank. I was like, &quot;Oh, my God, no. This is going to be so bad.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, this is again where God is amazing, or whatever, because when it</br>   was going to be our turn where you give the papers and they ask you these</br>   questions, the guy in front of us was caught. So, a bunch of officers went</br>   over to him, and started asking him all these questions, so I just grabbed</br>   my mom's hand and I'm like, &quot;Mom, let's just go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: We walked, and they didn't ask any questions, nothing. We just</br>   walked, and we were in the US. And that was a relief because I didn't want</br>   to go through the other thing all over again. [Chuckle]. To this day, I</br>   swear I don't know how that happened. And I'm just so grateful because, I</br>   mean, we were able to do it that easy, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My mom's always telling me this. When you do good things in life, and</br>   you're a good person, good things happen to you. And ever since then, I've</br>   been so grateful for that opportunity that I just try to be good to people</br>   and I just try to do good things, you know? So, I guess that can come back</br>   to me? And yeah, but that's how we got to the US, and then we got on a</br>   van...</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, then we met up with my brother. That was the best moment, when</br>   I saw my brother, because he's always been everything to me, always, and</br>   just being able to see him and hug him and everything, that was the best</br>   moment. And then, we got on the van, and it took us around three days, two</br>   days, I honestly don't remember, to get to North Carolina. And, yeah. Then</br>   united with my dad, and that's it. That's the story of how we got there.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: The perseverance is just amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Where you have to keep going…</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, how did you learn English? Did you go to school?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was very lucky too on that perspective because, like I said, when</br>   we got there, it was a really small community, and my school only had a few</br>   Latin people. But the school actually had teachers, English teachers. They</br>   were so nice to me, and I was able to get one-on-one classes, and it was so</br>   personalized, and they were so committed. Even my regular teacher, she was</br>   Ms. ___, and I'll never forget her. She was so nice to me, and she would</br>   help me so much. I've always been a really good student, and I always</br>   wanted my grades, and do good in everything. And I was really good in math,</br>   obviously because it was numbers, and I was always top in that area, in</br>   that subject. But then when it came to reading and everything, it was kind</br>   of complicated, so she helped me so much. She paid so much attention to me,</br>   and thank God, I was able to learn the language in a few months thanks to</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And thanks to my dad pushing me, too, because there were things that</br>   we had to do, and he didn't have a translator. So, I had to do it for him.</br>   That helped out a lot. So, I would say I learned in nine months tops.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, were you able to maintain those grades that you had had in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes. Well, fourth grade, obviously, my first year, I had a couple</br>   D's; I never had an F ever, ever. But, yeah, I tried so hard. I've always</br>   tried so hard.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Because pretty much, like I said, I tried so hard, but my biggest</br>   dream growing up and going to school is I'm going to school and I'm going</br>   to do so good because I want to go to college. I want to have a degree, and</br>   I want to be able to help people. I want to represent Mexico because just—I</br>   love the States because of everything that it gave me, but the way that it</br>   happened, it was so hard on me, and I always wanted to prove that Mexicans</br>   can do good, and good things, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And so, going to high school, I tried really hard, I had really good</br>   grades, I graduated third in my class. I was so into volunteering, I was in</br>   the student council, I did sports, I did everything. I wanted to be perfect</br>   so I could get scholarships. But it got to a point that I finally</br>   understood that it was never going to happen because it's so expensive. I</br>   couldn't go to a community college, I couldn't go—which was never my idea.</br>   I couldn't go to a four-year college because it was so expensive, and the</br>   scholarships are limited for people like me who were undocumented. When I</br>   finally got that, it just broke my heart because I was like, &quot;I've tried so</br>   hard. I've given it everything, and I'm still not going to be able to stay</br>   here.&quot; So, one day, I talked to my dad and I said, &quot;Dad, I really, really</br>   want to go to college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And he's like, &quot;But I can't do it. I can't pay for it. It's too</br>   expensive.&quot; And he's like, &quot;You either stay here and work, and try to go</br>   whenever you save up, or you go back to Mexico.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And I thought about it. I was like, &quot;Well, Mexico's my country, my</br>   dad's telling me to pretty much leave and he's not going to support me, so</br>   might as well just leave.&quot; So, right after college [means, high school] I</br>   graduated June 11th in 2011, and I was back to Mexico July second in 2011.</br>   And I just decided to leave, to start over.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, you pretty much just came by yourself? You made that decision?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I did. I was 18, and I said to myself, &quot;If you have this one dream,</br>   you're not going to be limited as to where you are. If you want to be</br>   someone, you're going to be someone anywhere in the world.&quot; So, I just</br>   said, &quot;Okay, I'm going to leave.&quot; And I left my parents and my brother, and</br>   I've been here in Mexico for almost eight years now.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: For almost 10 years?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Eight years? Eight years, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And this, I'm just going to go back for a second. Did you ever</br>   think about applying for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: DACA was not available at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: DACA was implemented in 2012, and I came back 2011.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah. Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: [Laughs]. Everything happens for a reason, and I'm so sure about</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, you've been back eight years. How has being back in Mexico</br>   been? How was that transition coming in, what did you do, who did you meet</br>   up with, what did you do or what are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, I came back. One of my aunts, my dad's sister, greeted me. She</br>   opened her doors to her house, and I lived with them for six months. I came</br>   back July second and I had a job in August. Pretty much everyone, the only</br>   opportunities that we have here as returnees and everything, is call</br>   centers. So, I started working at a call center. I had a really hard time.</br>   No, not this one, Tevista. Telvista was the first call center I went to.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: It was just a relief being able to find a job so fast, but it's not</br>   something that I loved. It was really tough, but it was a relief at the</br>   same time because I was going to be able to meet people and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When you come back from the States and you went to high school, and</br>   you want to validate that you actually finished high school, you have to do</br>   certain process in Mexico. I knew that before I came back; I tried to get</br>   all my documents ready and everything, but the system here is so slow, and</br>   I still had to lose a year of college, and I couldn't go because my</br>   paperwork wasn't turned in.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was able to apply to a public college, Instituto Politécnico</br>   Nacional. I made it, but the classes and everything didn't give me time to</br>   work, and at the time, I had agreed with my dad that I wasn't ever going to</br>   ask for any help, like monetary help. So, I decided to decline that, and</br>   look for a private college. And I did. I found a really good college who</br>   allowed me, they allowed me to work full-time and go to college full-time.</br>   So, I majored in international business and commerce, my dream career, and</br>   I went to college for four years while working.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When I was in Telvista, I started as a CSR, just answering calls, and</br>   became mentor, and then I was a supervisor at 19, which was really hard</br>   experience—it was so tough—but at the same time, it helped me so much and</br>   it gave me the basics to work and be able to do what I do now. Then I</br>   worked for the Western Union Corporate, the one that they have here in</br>   Mexico. I was in Telvista for two years and a half, then Western Union for</br>   a year and a half, and then I was sick and tired of call centers, I didn't</br>   want to do that anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And, I'm so persistent, and my tenacity is always up here, you know?</br>   And I was like, &quot;Nope, I'm done with this. I need to do something that</br>   involves my career.&quot; So, when I was in sixth semester, I tried to look for</br>   a job regarding my major, and I was able to find a job. But it was more</br>   like an intern job, so I was so blessed because I had savings, you know, so</br>   I was able to take it. But they paid so little! [Laughs]. It was awful!</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But I'm so grateful for that opportunity, because that company that</br>   hired me, it was a fusion. They were two companies, a company that was</br>   based in China, in Shanghai, for inspection services, and an international</br>   logistics company that took care of [inaudible 00:26:06] and the customs</br>   clearance and everything. When I first got there, I went to the logistics</br>   one, which involved me selling international transportation. I had no idea;</br>   I had no training. I tried so hard but honestly, I did a really bad job.</br>   [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But the other company's director, he saw how pushy I was, how</br>   dedicated I was—I mean, I'm talking about, the normal hours to come into</br>   work were at nine, and I signed my contract to go from nine to four, but I</br>   would always get there at eight. I would organize my calls, and at nine, I</br>   was calling, prospecting, and everything. And he saw my dedication, and</br>   three months after my hiring, he offered me a position at the inspections</br>   company. And that was just life-changing because after that, he obviously</br>   raised my salary.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: He is an amazing boss. He's still my boss until today. After a year</br>   and a half, been with both, the fusion of the company, he decides to</br>   separate. So, we went from being the company department to being a company.</br>   So, I've been able to help him out with the whole... from logo, from</br>   everything. Everything regarding the company. And I'm just so grateful, I'm</br>   so happy there, you have no idea. I've been able to travel to China twice</br>   already. I travel in Mexico City so much. I've met so many people, the</br>   China chamber, the Mexico City chamber, so many important organizations, so</br>   many important people, so many important... Forever 21, for instance. We're</br>   trying to do services for them.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And it was just so amazing. Everything happens for a reason. I know</br>   that maybe I wasn't supposed to stay over there. Maybe it was just a little</br>   help, to try and be to where I am today. But still, I know there's</br>   opportunities in Mexico. I barely learned about New Comienzos a month ago.</br>   And I just want to tell people and help them understand that we don't have</br>   to be over there. We can do so many things here. And we can prove that</br>   they're missing out! [Laughs]. Because I could have done all this for a</br>   company that is based over there, but obviously, well, that was impossible,</br>   so I'm here.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You didn't receive any help from the government when you came</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Any help from any non-government?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No. Nothing.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Nothing. Okay. I'm assuming, but just let me know, is your family</br>   still in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes, they are.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Have you seen them?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I have not seen them in eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, tell me about that, if you feel comfortable.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: It's tough, it's so tough. I've always been so close to my mom and my</br>   brother, you have no idea. The first few years, I guess, because I was</br>   always so overprotected—my dad was overprotective of me in the States, and</br>   I wasn't able to go out or anything—honestly, the first year, two years, I</br>   was free, you know? [Laughs]. I could do whatever I wanted, I lived on my</br>   own, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But then it just got to me. The third year was so bad. So bad because</br>   there was a point in time that I had economic issues, and had to reach out</br>   to my parents, and I was like, &quot;Help me out a little bit?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But it was more than not having enough money or whatever, it was just</br>   not having my mom by my side, telling me everything was going to be okay.</br>   And I mean, so far, I never tell them my problems because they can't do</br>   anything about it, you know? I can't call my mom and tell her that I'm sad</br>   or that I'm... I don't know, because she can't do anything. She's so far.</br>   [Emotional]. I'm so sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. Take your time.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And my brother got married a year ago. I wasn't able to be there. You</br>   know? [Crying]. I'm so sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: He's always been my everything, and it was so hard not to be there</br>   for him. And, well, he's going to be a dad. And I'm not going to be able to</br>   see my little niece. Oh, sorry, it's just like...But I know we'll be</br>   together someday, and I'm working so hard because I know I'm not a bad</br>   person. I think that I should be able to get a visa to be able to go back.</br>   I'm not going to stay, you know? I just want to see my family. I'm so</br>   sorry. [Crying].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. It's totally okay.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah. But, yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, their plan is to stay in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yep. Sorry. [Chuckles while crying].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. We can take a few minutes.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No, no, it's fine.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You're totally fine, it's normal.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And thank you for sharing.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No, it's just like... I don't talk about this at all, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I can't even imagine. I guess right now, I'm going through the</br>   period where I've been separated from my family for the longest, because</br>   I'm studying in the States but I'm from Puerto Rico.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, I'm the only person in my family who's in the States right</br>   now, but I just can't even imagine being separated from them for that long.</br>   I also have, I'm the oldest of three, so it's also feeling like you have</br>   that responsibility towards your siblings—</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Exactly, yeah. Yeah, true.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And you want to help out your family, and so, that's why I'm</br>   studying over there, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, that's so nice. That's amazing. That's amazing, yeah. But you</br>   kind of understand. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: But I know that you're going to see them again, and I'm sure that</br>   they're so proud of you, because honestly, everything that you've told me</br>   so far is just so amazing. Like, damn, girl!</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, thank you...[Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: If you had asked me a few years ago, I would be confused, but I can</br>   tell you now that I'm Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And you mentioned a little earlier in the beginning that you were</br>   angry of leaving the US because you loved Mexico and you wanted to stay</br>   here. Do you still feel that way now that you're back?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was angry when I had to go to the US because I had everything here,</br>   you know? And then, I was so angry because they took me over there, and I</br>   tried so hard, and I wanted to stay over there, and I had to come back.</br>   I've had to change. I'm not trying to be like, &quot;Oh, poor me,&quot; and people</br>   feel pity for me or anything at all, but it's just like, why can't a person</br>   just live, and be where they want to be? That just gets to me. It’s not</br>   like I'm mad at the US, or I'm mad at my parents because they took me, I'm</br>   just mad that people have to go through that, you know? Just to run away</br>   from things, as kids. Because I know there's millions and thousands,</br>   thousands, of kids that have to do what their parents tell them. But I'm</br>   happy in Mexico, I can tell you that. It was probably the best decision</br>   that I could have made. I don't know what would have happened if I had</br>   stayed over there. Who knows?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But I think it was a good decision, and mainly because I was so</br>   dedicated, and I always knew what I wanted, and I worked so hard for it. I</br>   didn't give up. I think that's the difference. And bumping into so many</br>   amazing people who have been there for me, who have helped me. Like my boss</br>   right now, sometimes he's kind of like my dad, you know? He knows my story,</br>   and he helps me so much, and he tells me, &quot;You're going to see your parents</br>   again, and I'm going to make sure, and I'm going to help you, and I don't</br>   know what we're going to have to do, but you're going to see them again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And just bumping into people like that is just amazing, and I'm just</br>   so grateful. I always say that I'm so overly blessed, honestly. I really</br>   am. And I'm happy here. I'm happy in my country, I'm happy being free; not</br>   being scared that at any given time someone's going to come and take me.</br>   I'm just free.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, just I guess hypothetically, if you could have stayed in the</br>   US, what do you think you would have done?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I would have went to college, obviously. I actually wanted to go to</br>   Salem College. I don't know if you've heard about it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I tried, and they tried to help me so much so I could go, but it was</br>   still very expensive. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, you got in?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah, I was accepted.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You were accepted.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes, I was. But again, I couldn't stay. And I would have gone to</br>   college, same major, that's what I wanted, and worked for an international</br>   logistics company, and do what I do. [Chuckles]. And be happy. And</br>   obviously, being close to my parents—not even, parents are obviously</br>   important, but my mom and my brother who are like everything to me, you</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Obviously, now that you're back, you've already done so many</br>   amazing things, but what are your dreams? What else would you like to do</br>   while you're here?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Okay, well, right now, one of the things, meeting New Comienzos and</br>   everything that they do, I want to help people. I know how tough it is to</br>   come back, I know everything that you have to go through. I want to be</br>   someone who helps them out. I don't know how, but that's one of the things</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I'm working on establishing my own company. I'm really excited about</br>   that. I want to have something of my own, and I'm talking about short-term.</br>   I want to start it already because I know so many people, I have all this</br>   knowledge, I have everything. I just need to do it, you know? [Chuckle].</br>   And that's one of my objectives…dreams. It's always been a dream to have my</br>   own company, but now, I have to make it a reality, and I have to work up to</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I want to get married someday. [Laughs]. I've been single ever since</br>   I came back. On a personal note, that would be amazing. And right now, I'm</br>   just working so hard, I want to try and see if I can get my visa and be</br>   able to visit my parents.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Tell me about this company! What would your company be?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: [Laughs]. It's going to be, we call it a trading company because I</br>   know a lot of brands nationally that need to be expanded. And I also do a</br>   lot of business with China, and we import 80% of the things that we have in</br>   Mexico. There's a lot of people who have the money, they have the people</br>   who they're going to sell to, but they don't know, they don't have the</br>   knowledge on how to do it, how to import, process everything. So, I want to</br>   be able to help them out. So, not even just for me, but help brands grow,</br>   help other people develop their business, as well. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I'm excited to see, in a few years, how that comes across, and</br>   that's going to be incredible.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Thank you. It has to be. It has to be amazing! Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You're literally right now... like, oh, my gosh, you're an</br>   inspiration for me right now. [Ilse laughs]. I'm just going to start my</br>   third year of college now, and I can only dream of being where you're at</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, girl, thank you so much! And it's just like, you have to do what</br>   makes you happy. That's the only thing that I live by, you know? What makes</br>   you happy, and not like joder a las personas. Just do you, and help people</br>   out, and amazing things will happen. So, what you're doing right now is</br>   amazing. Thank you so much. I hadn't talked about my story of how I got</br>   there, not many people know, because it's weird and not people relate to it</br>   at all. They wouldn't understand.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I just have a few more questions that are more just of a</br>   reflection. The first, I guess in talking about returning, and the lack of</br>   government assistance, what do you think that the Mexican government can do</br>   to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: First of all, from the experience of being at the border…Because they</br>   deport people, you know? I think a few years back, they had flights to</br>   Mexico City, but they canceled that with the Trump administration. So now,</br>   they pretty much dump them on the border, and they have to see how they can</br>   find help. So, I think one of the things we have to strengthen is our part</br>   of the border. Help people in the border.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When I left, I remember how the Mexican government, the Mexican</br>   officials, they gave us a talk. Like, &quot;Oh, you're about to do something</br>   that's not right, but if it's your decision, we can't force you or stop you</br>   from doing it.&quot; Why not change that speech? Why not say, &quot;Don't leave. How</br>   can we help you so you won't leave?&quot; I mean, we could fix a problem from</br>   the root, why they're leaving. And then, when they do come back, analyze</br>   the people, make a profile—there's a lot of people that are being deported</br>   that have so much knowledge.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I just met this one guy who worked in interior design and</br>   construction all his life, and he has so much knowledge that he could help</br>   people out. We have kind of buildings all over the place, and there's</br>   always been something done in construction-wise. We help them out, you</br>   know? Lend them a hand, give them the tools to have their own company, to</br>   have what they had over there, and not make them feel restrained, or not</br>   make them feel that they're not part of the country when we're in the same</br>   boat.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I think we have to work on that. We have to work on having work</br>   opportunities not only in call centers. There's a lot of people who are too</br>   good to be in a call center, but that's all they can find because maybe</br>   they don't have a college degree, but they have experience. And I can tell</br>   you, and it still happens to me, when people... When I'm working, I do have</br>   to speak English sometimes, but when I'm in meetings with clients and</br>   things like that, it's just Spanish. And when they hear that I speak</br>   English or they talk about the States or something and I say that was there</br>   and things like that, and they ask me why I'm here, and just telling them,</br>   &quot;Oh, well, I came back because I wanted to.&quot; And then, them looking at me</br>   weird, like, &quot;Why would you come back if you were over there?&quot; Or when they</br>   ask, &quot;Did you have to come back because you were illegal?&quot; Dude, well,</br>   yeah, I came back because I couldn't stay over there, but you don't have to</br>   treat me differently.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And the type of people that I meet are people who have visas, who go</br>   back and forth, and they don't understand; &quot;Well, why don't you get a visa?</br>   Why did you leave without a visa?&quot; “No...” And I think changing that</br>   mindset, too, from the people that are here— the people that were born here</br>   and everything—there must be a way to make them understand that we're still</br>   Mexican. It wasn't our decision most of the time, why we had to leave. You</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I mean, I've been here for eight years, and it still happens</br>   sometimes. People just look at me weird because I came back. And I think</br>   the government has to have this type of organizations like New Comienzos so</br>   people can relate, so people can get out there. New Comienzos is amazing</br>   and everything, but a lot of people build their own community, and they're</br>   just together and not meeting other people out there. Maybe having a</br>   workshop or a hiring fair or exhibition for people that come back to find</br>   companies who need bilingual people specialized in certain areas. I think</br>   that would help, too. Just giving them more opportunities, I think, would</br>   be perfect.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And kind of along that same line, it's, what can the United States</br>   government do to help Mexican deportees and the family that they leave</br>   behind? What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, for one thing, a lot of people that are deported don't even</br>   have a criminal record. They don't have no background or anything that</br>   says, &quot;Oh, you're a bad person, and you can't be here.&quot; Maybe just really</br>   giving them a chance to—especially when you deport the dad, or the mom, and</br>   they leave their family behind. Like, why would you separate families? I</br>   mean, that's not even humanly fair. It's so unfair. It's so, so unfair.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I understand their ground, I understand that “Why would they be</br>   invaded by Mexicans?” But they also have to understand the situations here.</br>   Maybe work along, like I said, fix a problem from the root. I don't know.</br>   Both governments have to sit down and talk about this. Like right now, the</br>   importing tariff that was imposed of five percent on all the Mexican</br>   products being exported to the U.S. unless we stop the people crossing</br>   over. But if we had more opportunities and the governments both worked</br>   together to make the economy grow here and have more chances for them not</br>   to even think about leaving, it would change a lot. So, we have to analyze</br>   why people are leaving, and try to fix that problem. And they should work</br>   together. It sounds so easy, right? But it's so complicated. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah! I guess those are really all the questions that I had</br>   specifically, but I want to give you the chance now to say anything else</br>   that you think you may not have said, or anything else that you might want</br>   to add, if you want to.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, I just want to say thank you to you and everyone who's here to</br>   try to gather information to try and do something about the situation. I</br>   think that's so amazing, and I just... I don't know what we have to do.</br>   People who come back, or people who are thinking about coming back because</br>   they're not comfortable in the States, should be able to do it without a</br>   problem and feel safe that they are welcome here with open arms. And that</br>   they see that there's opportunities outside of the US, and that we can</br>   build a better economy here if a lot of people were still here, or people</br>   went to college.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="ffc06a0e-9cea-4533-822c-ecc8772c15b0" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Ilse: I met this one guy who studied, well, he went to college in Texas,<br>

   &quot;Because I make dollars here. I spend in pesos. And it's a lot cheaper. I<br>
   already bought my own apartment, I have my own car, I have all this,&quot; and<br>
   it's like, yeah, we can do it here, you know? It's not impossible. I'm so<br>

Because we arrived to a really small community in</br>   North Carolina, and it was kind of, like, hillbillies, and they're pretty</br>   racist. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And, yeah, it was difficult, you know? I arrived to the US when it</br>   was still summer vacations, had two weeks left of vacations before I</br>   started going to school. But at least I had a chance to kind of accept it,</br>   in a way, and not feel as weird when I went to school, but still. It was a</br>   rough day, that one day.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, how did you cross the border with your mom and your</br>   siblings, with a coyote or did you just go by yourselves?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My dad had a friend in the States, and he had family in Guerrero. So,</br>   they're like, &quot;So you guys won’t come alone, meet up with that family, so</br>   you can all come over.&quot; And so, we met this family. It was a mom with a</br>   son—he's older than me for about two years, I think, and a girl. She was,</br>   at that time, she was like five, I think. She was so small.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My brother, he was seven at the time; so he's younger than me. And</br>   so, we met up in the city and we traveled to the border. The plan was to</br>   cross the border through the desert, all of us, with a coyote. But my</br>   brother and the little girl were too young. I was too young, too, but I</br>   didn't want to leave my mom. So, they separated us.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My brother went with this other family, who took care of him, and he</br>   crossed the border asleep in a car, which was... it was, I want to say</br>   easy, but after hearing his story, and how he had to suffer because these</br>   people hit him, and you know, abused him, because he couldn't do anything.</br>   People were just mean to him, and he was trying to protect the little girl,</br>   that then I understood that it wasn't easy for him, either.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And so, I was left behind with my mom, and the woman with her son,</br>   and we tried to cross the border through the desert. But it was awful. Even</br>   being at the border, waiting for the instructions to go ahead and start the</br>   journey, you know? And seeing so many people, and kids, and women... It was</br>   just so bad, you know? And those images are so vivid in my head still. Then</br>   after that, we were lost in the desert for three days. We ran out of water,</br>   we ran out of food, we ran out of everything; the coyote got lost. And</br>   there was a point... when it rains in the desert, it's so bad. Like, the</br>   thunderstorms are so, so bad. I'll never forget how this woman that was</br>   traveling with us, she was like hallucinating, I guess. It was so bad that</br>   it was raining and that there was a thunderstorm, and she thought that this</br>   one cactus was a person.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, she almost fell, so she thought she was going to grab onto</br>   someone, and she grabbed onto the cactus, and all her body was left with</br>   the little pikes. It was so bad, and then being lost…</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: We knew that they were going to be looking for us, obviously, or</br>   someone out there, so we just decided to wait. We waited it out. But before</br>   that, when it was raining, too... This was like a breaking point. There was</br>   a little, small creek, or little river, I guess you could say. When there's</br>   a thunderstorm and it's so dark, the thunder and then you're blacked out,</br>   you're blinded because of the light. And then, we lost track of the people.</br>   So, my mom and I got lost, right?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, we had to cross the little creek thing, and then my mom just</br>   slipped, and she was about to just keep going with the flow, and I was</br>   so... God is amazing, because I just can't believe He gave me the strength,</br>   you know, to save my mom. And this man came back for us. It's just so</br>   crazy, because who does that, you know? Who actually comes back to check on</br>   people when you have to take care of yourself? He helped us, we crossed it,</br>   but we were still lost. So, once again, we got to a point where, like,</br>   &quot;Okay, we're going to wait it out.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But it rained so hard, and it was so hot, and we didn't have anything</br>   to eat or no water, and then I was just like blacked out. My mom says that</br>   I was gone for hours, and I was hallucinating, and literally, she thought I</br>   was going to die because it was so bad. So, the men that were with us, they</br>   went out looking for water or something, and they came across this—they</br>   said it was kind of like a pond kind of thing, but it was more like animal</br>   pee and, I don't know. So, they brought that back. My mom still had some</br>   limes, and my mom put lime in it, and she kept trying to get me water, and</br>   that's how like, I came back apparently. That's what she said. I don't</br>   remember anything about that.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, the coyote comes back, and he's like, &quot;Okay, I found out a way.</br>   We're good to go. We just got to keep walking.&quot; And that was the third day.</br>   And so, we kept walking, and I don't know where we hear the helicopter, and</br>   we hear the vans, and dogs, and they caught us, you know? We were so close.</br>   So close. And yet so far, literally.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, my mom just hugged me and she's like, &quot;The first thing you're</br>   going to do is you're going to run to the water.&quot; And, yeah. So, they</br>   caught us, and they said that we're violating US laws. They were so rude,</br>   so rude, I swear. And then they were like—I mean, I know I was a little</br>   girl, but I could understand what they were telling my mom, you know?—and</br>   they were just like, angry at her, too, because, &quot;How could you ever even</br>   think that your daughter... and she's so young...&quot; Apparently, I looked</br>   really sick. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And so, they just got us on the vans, and we went to the border</br>   prison. I was in prison for some time. Well, a day. [Chuckles]. And then,</br>   they took us back to the border and we had to start all over again. And it</br>   was just so sad and depressing, because the way we tried and everything we</br>   went through. That's why I was so angry when I got over there, because no</br>   human being should have to go through so much just so they could change</br>   their economic status, or just so they could run away from problems that</br>   you can't control.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, then we found out my brother was over there already. He was in</br>   Texas, I think; I don't even know. And my mom was like, &quot;We have to do it</br>   again. We have to try because your brother's over there, because your dad's</br>   already waiting for us.&quot; So, we didn't have any money, we didn't have</br>   anything, but the woman that we were with, she still had some money. So, we</br>   went over to a motel—and this is where I'm always grateful, and God is</br>   like... or I have this huge angel or something.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: The owners of the motel kind of heard the story when my mom was</br>   talking to my dad on the phone, and they said that they knew these people</br>   that faked the visas, or passports, and we could do it with them. And so,</br>   my mom talked to my dad and everything, and so, we were in training for two</br>   days, learning somebody else's identity. Name, everything, you have to know</br>   everything about the person, or at least the basics. It had to be in</br>   English, and I didn't know any English, or my mom didn't know any</br>   English—she's so bad at that. [Chuckles]. So we kept practicing and</br>   practicing, and I finally got it, right? So, I was good to go. And then my</br>   mom, she had a really, really hard time. Really hard time.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: The day came when we had to actually do it. A slight happy moment</br>   that I had was when they brought me clothes, because you have to look good,</br>   you have to look like you were normal, I guess. So, I got new clothes, and</br>   I was so happy because it had been three horrible weeks before that, and</br>   then just getting that was really nice. And the people were so nice to me,</br>   so nice.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, we get to the border on a van, and they're like, &quot;Okay, so,</br>   everyone's going to separate, everyone is going to go their own way, and</br>   we'll see you guys when we cross.&quot; So, we were on our own. And I remember</br>   asking my mom, &quot;Mom, just tell me a little bit, what's your story?&quot; And she</br>   just blacked out. She didn't know anything. Like, she just went blank, her</br>   mind went blank. I was like, &quot;Oh, my God, no. This is going to be so bad.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, this is again where God is amazing, or whatever, because when it</br>   was going to be our turn where you give the papers and they ask you these</br>   questions, the guy in front of us was caught. So, a bunch of officers went</br>   over to him, and started asking him all these questions, so I just grabbed</br>   my mom's hand and I'm like, &quot;Mom, let's just go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: We walked, and they didn't ask any questions, nothing. We just</br>   walked, and we were in the US. And that was a relief because I didn't want</br>   to go through the other thing all over again. [Chuckle]. To this day, I</br>   swear I don't know how that happened. And I'm just so grateful because, I</br>   mean, we were able to do it that easy, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My mom's always telling me this. When you do good things in life, and</br>   you're a good person, good things happen to you. And ever since then, I've</br>   been so grateful for that opportunity that I just try to be good to people</br>   and I just try to do good things, you know? So, I guess that can come back</br>   to me? And yeah, but that's how we got to the US, and then we got on a</br>   van...</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, then we met up with my brother. That was the best moment, when</br>   I saw my brother, because he's always been everything to me, always, and</br>   just being able to see him and hug him and everything, that was the best</br>   moment. And then, we got on the van, and it took us around three days, two</br>   days, I honestly don't remember, to get to North Carolina. And, yeah. Then</br>   united with my dad, and that's it. That's the story of how we got there.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: The perseverance is just amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Where you have to keep going…</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, how did you learn English? Did you go to school?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was very lucky too on that perspective because, like I said, when</br>   we got there, it was a really small community, and my school only had a few</br>   Latin people. But the school actually had teachers, English teachers. They</br>   were so nice to me, and I was able to get one-on-one classes, and it was so</br>   personalized, and they were so committed. Even my regular teacher, she was</br>   Ms. ___, and I'll never forget her. She was so nice to me, and she would</br>   help me so much. I've always been a really good student, and I always</br>   wanted my grades, and do good in everything. And I was really good in math,</br>   obviously because it was numbers, and I was always top in that area, in</br>   that subject. But then when it came to reading and everything, it was kind</br>   of complicated, so she helped me so much. She paid so much attention to me,</br>   and thank God, I was able to learn the language in a few months thanks to</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And thanks to my dad pushing me, too, because there were things that</br>   we had to do, and he didn't have a translator. So, I had to do it for him.</br>   That helped out a lot. So, I would say I learned in nine months tops.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, were you able to maintain those grades that you had had in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes. Well, fourth grade, obviously, my first year, I had a couple</br>   D's; I never had an F ever, ever. But, yeah, I tried so hard. I've always</br>   tried so hard.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Because pretty much, like I said, I tried so hard, but my biggest</br>   dream growing up and going to school is I'm going to school and I'm going</br>   to do so good because I want to go to college. I want to have a degree, and</br>   I want to be able to help people. I want to represent Mexico because just—I</br>   love the States because of everything that it gave me, but the way that it</br>   happened, it was so hard on me, and I always wanted to prove that Mexicans</br>   can do good, and good things, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And so, going to high school, I tried really hard, I had really good</br>   grades, I graduated third in my class. I was so into volunteering, I was in</br>   the student council, I did sports, I did everything. I wanted to be perfect</br>   so I could get scholarships. But it got to a point that I finally</br>   understood that it was never going to happen because it's so expensive. I</br>   couldn't go to a community college, I couldn't go—which was never my idea.</br>   I couldn't go to a four-year college because it was so expensive, and the</br>   scholarships are limited for people like me who were undocumented. When I</br>   finally got that, it just broke my heart because I was like, &quot;I've tried so</br>   hard. I've given it everything, and I'm still not going to be able to stay</br>   here.&quot; So, one day, I talked to my dad and I said, &quot;Dad, I really, really</br>   want to go to college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And he's like, &quot;But I can't do it. I can't pay for it. It's too</br>   expensive.&quot; And he's like, &quot;You either stay here and work, and try to go</br>   whenever you save up, or you go back to Mexico.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And I thought about it. I was like, &quot;Well, Mexico's my country, my</br>   dad's telling me to pretty much leave and he's not going to support me, so</br>   might as well just leave.&quot; So, right after college [means, high school] I</br>   graduated June 11th in 2011, and I was back to Mexico July second in 2011.</br>   And I just decided to leave, to start over.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, you pretty much just came by yourself? You made that decision?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I did. I was 18, and I said to myself, &quot;If you have this one dream,</br>   you're not going to be limited as to where you are. If you want to be</br>   someone, you're going to be someone anywhere in the world.&quot; So, I just</br>   said, &quot;Okay, I'm going to leave.&quot; And I left my parents and my brother, and</br>   I've been here in Mexico for almost eight years now.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: For almost 10 years?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Eight years? Eight years, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And this, I'm just going to go back for a second. Did you ever</br>   think about applying for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: DACA was not available at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: DACA was implemented in 2012, and I came back 2011.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah. Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: [Laughs]. Everything happens for a reason, and I'm so sure about</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, you've been back eight years. How has being back in Mexico</br>   been? How was that transition coming in, what did you do, who did you meet</br>   up with, what did you do or what are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, I came back. One of my aunts, my dad's sister, greeted me. She</br>   opened her doors to her house, and I lived with them for six months. I came</br>   back July second and I had a job in August. Pretty much everyone, the only</br>   opportunities that we have here as returnees and everything, is call</br>   centers. So, I started working at a call center. I had a really hard time.</br>   No, not this one, Tevista. Telvista was the first call center I went to.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: It was just a relief being able to find a job so fast, but it's not</br>   something that I loved. It was really tough, but it was a relief at the</br>   same time because I was going to be able to meet people and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When you come back from the States and you went to high school, and</br>   you want to validate that you actually finished high school, you have to do</br>   certain process in Mexico. I knew that before I came back; I tried to get</br>   all my documents ready and everything, but the system here is so slow, and</br>   I still had to lose a year of college, and I couldn't go because my</br>   paperwork wasn't turned in.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was able to apply to a public college, Instituto Politécnico</br>   Nacional. I made it, but the classes and everything didn't give me time to</br>   work, and at the time, I had agreed with my dad that I wasn't ever going to</br>   ask for any help, like monetary help. So, I decided to decline that, and</br>   look for a private college. And I did. I found a really good college who</br>   allowed me, they allowed me to work full-time and go to college full-time.</br>   So, I majored in international business and commerce, my dream career, and</br>   I went to college for four years while working.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When I was in Telvista, I started as a CSR, just answering calls, and</br>   became mentor, and then I was a supervisor at 19, which was really hard</br>   experience—it was so tough—but at the same time, it helped me so much and</br>   it gave me the basics to work and be able to do what I do now. Then I</br>   worked for the Western Union Corporate, the one that they have here in</br>   Mexico. I was in Telvista for two years and a half, then Western Union for</br>   a year and a half, and then I was sick and tired of call centers, I didn't</br>   want to do that anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And, I'm so persistent, and my tenacity is always up here, you know?</br>   And I was like, &quot;Nope, I'm done with this. I need to do something that</br>   involves my career.&quot; So, when I was in sixth semester, I tried to look for</br>   a job regarding my major, and I was able to find a job. But it was more</br>   like an intern job, so I was so blessed because I had savings, you know, so</br>   I was able to take it. But they paid so little! [Laughs]. It was awful!</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But I'm so grateful for that opportunity, because that company that</br>   hired me, it was a fusion. They were two companies, a company that was</br>   based in China, in Shanghai, for inspection services, and an international</br>   logistics company that took care of [inaudible 00:26:06] and the customs</br>   clearance and everything. When I first got there, I went to the logistics</br>   one, which involved me selling international transportation. I had no idea;</br>   I had no training. I tried so hard but honestly, I did a really bad job.</br>   [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But the other company's director, he saw how pushy I was, how</br>   dedicated I was—I mean, I'm talking about, the normal hours to come into</br>   work were at nine, and I signed my contract to go from nine to four, but I</br>   would always get there at eight. I would organize my calls, and at nine, I</br>   was calling, prospecting, and everything. And he saw my dedication, and</br>   three months after my hiring, he offered me a position at the inspections</br>   company. And that was just life-changing because after that, he obviously</br>   raised my salary.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: He is an amazing boss. He's still my boss until today. After a year</br>   and a half, been with both, the fusion of the company, he decides to</br>   separate. So, we went from being the company department to being a company.</br>   So, I've been able to help him out with the whole... from logo, from</br>   everything. Everything regarding the company. And I'm just so grateful, I'm</br>   so happy there, you have no idea. I've been able to travel to China twice</br>   already. I travel in Mexico City so much. I've met so many people, the</br>   China chamber, the Mexico City chamber, so many important organizations, so</br>   many important people, so many important... Forever 21, for instance. We're</br>   trying to do services for them.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And it was just so amazing. Everything happens for a reason. I know</br>   that maybe I wasn't supposed to stay over there. Maybe it was just a little</br>   help, to try and be to where I am today. But still, I know there's</br>   opportunities in Mexico. I barely learned about New Comienzos a month ago.</br>   And I just want to tell people and help them understand that we don't have</br>   to be over there. We can do so many things here. And we can prove that</br>   they're missing out! [Laughs]. Because I could have done all this for a</br>   company that is based over there, but obviously, well, that was impossible,</br>   so I'm here.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You didn't receive any help from the government when you came</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Any help from any non-government?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No. Nothing.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Nothing. Okay. I'm assuming, but just let me know, is your family</br>   still in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes, they are.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Have you seen them?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I have not seen them in eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, tell me about that, if you feel comfortable.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: It's tough, it's so tough. I've always been so close to my mom and my</br>   brother, you have no idea. The first few years, I guess, because I was</br>   always so overprotected—my dad was overprotective of me in the States, and</br>   I wasn't able to go out or anything—honestly, the first year, two years, I</br>   was free, you know? [Laughs]. I could do whatever I wanted, I lived on my</br>   own, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But then it just got to me. The third year was so bad. So bad because</br>   there was a point in time that I had economic issues, and had to reach out</br>   to my parents, and I was like, &quot;Help me out a little bit?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But it was more than not having enough money or whatever, it was just</br>   not having my mom by my side, telling me everything was going to be okay.</br>   And I mean, so far, I never tell them my problems because they can't do</br>   anything about it, you know? I can't call my mom and tell her that I'm sad</br>   or that I'm... I don't know, because she can't do anything. She's so far.</br>   [Emotional]. I'm so sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. Take your time.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And my brother got married a year ago. I wasn't able to be there. You</br>   know? [Crying]. I'm so sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: He's always been my everything, and it was so hard not to be there</br>   for him. And, well, he's going to be a dad. And I'm not going to be able to</br>   see my little niece. Oh, sorry, it's just like...But I know we'll be</br>   together someday, and I'm working so hard because I know I'm not a bad</br>   person. I think that I should be able to get a visa to be able to go back.</br>   I'm not going to stay, you know? I just want to see my family. I'm so</br>   sorry. [Crying].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. It's totally okay.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah. But, yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, their plan is to stay in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yep. Sorry. [Chuckles while crying].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. We can take a few minutes.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No, no, it's fine.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You're totally fine, it's normal.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And thank you for sharing.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No, it's just like... I don't talk about this at all, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I can't even imagine. I guess right now, I'm going through the</br>   period where I've been separated from my family for the longest, because</br>   I'm studying in the States but I'm from Puerto Rico.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, I'm the only person in my family who's in the States right</br>   now, but I just can't even imagine being separated from them for that long.</br>   I also have, I'm the oldest of three, so it's also feeling like you have</br>   that responsibility towards your siblings—</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Exactly, yeah. Yeah, true.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And you want to help out your family, and so, that's why I'm</br>   studying over there, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, that's so nice. That's amazing. That's amazing, yeah. But you</br>   kind of understand. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: But I know that you're going to see them again, and I'm sure that</br>   they're so proud of you, because honestly, everything that you've told me</br>   so far is just so amazing. Like, damn, girl!</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, thank you...[Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: If you had asked me a few years ago, I would be confused, but I can</br>   tell you now that I'm Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And you mentioned a little earlier in the beginning that you were</br>   angry of leaving the US because you loved Mexico and you wanted to stay</br>   here. Do you still feel that way now that you're back?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was angry when I had to go to the US because I had everything here,</br>   you know? And then, I was so angry because they took me over there, and I</br>   tried so hard, and I wanted to stay over there, and I had to come back.</br>   I've had to change. I'm not trying to be like, &quot;Oh, poor me,&quot; and people</br>   feel pity for me or anything at all, but it's just like, why can't a person</br>   just live, and be where they want to be? That just gets to me. It’s not</br>   like I'm mad at the US, or I'm mad at my parents because they took me, I'm</br>   just mad that people have to go through that, you know? Just to run away</br>   from things, as kids. Because I know there's millions and thousands,</br>   thousands, of kids that have to do what their parents tell them. But I'm</br>   happy in Mexico, I can tell you that. It was probably the best decision</br>   that I could have made. I don't know what would have happened if I had</br>   stayed over there. Who knows?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But I think it was a good decision, and mainly because I was so</br>   dedicated, and I always knew what I wanted, and I worked so hard for it. I</br>   didn't give up. I think that's the difference. And bumping into so many</br>   amazing people who have been there for me, who have helped me. Like my boss</br>   right now, sometimes he's kind of like my dad, you know? He knows my story,</br>   and he helps me so much, and he tells me, &quot;You're going to see your parents</br>   again, and I'm going to make sure, and I'm going to help you, and I don't</br>   know what we're going to have to do, but you're going to see them again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And just bumping into people like that is just amazing, and I'm just</br>   so grateful. I always say that I'm so overly blessed, honestly. I really</br>   am. And I'm happy here. I'm happy in my country, I'm happy being free; not</br>   being scared that at any given time someone's going to come and take me.</br>   I'm just free.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, just I guess hypothetically, if you could have stayed in the</br>   US, what do you think you would have done?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I would have went to college, obviously. I actually wanted to go to</br>   Salem College. I don't know if you've heard about it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I tried, and they tried to help me so much so I could go, but it was</br>   still very expensive. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, you got in?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah, I was accepted.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You were accepted.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes, I was. But again, I couldn't stay. And I would have gone to</br>   college, same major, that's what I wanted, and worked for an international</br>   logistics company, and do what I do. [Chuckles]. And be happy. And</br>   obviously, being close to my parents—not even, parents are obviously</br>   important, but my mom and my brother who are like everything to me, you</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Obviously, now that you're back, you've already done so many</br>   amazing things, but what are your dreams? What else would you like to do</br>   while you're here?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Okay, well, right now, one of the things, meeting New Comienzos and</br>   everything that they do, I want to help people. I know how tough it is to</br>   come back, I know everything that you have to go through. I want to be</br>   someone who helps them out. I don't know how, but that's one of the things</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I'm working on establishing my own company. I'm really excited about</br>   that. I want to have something of my own, and I'm talking about short-term.</br>   I want to start it already because I know so many people, I have all this</br>   knowledge, I have everything. I just need to do it, you know? [Chuckle].</br>   And that's one of my objectives…dreams. It's always been a dream to have my</br>   own company, but now, I have to make it a reality, and I have to work up to</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I want to get married someday. [Laughs]. I've been single ever since</br>   I came back. On a personal note, that would be amazing. And right now, I'm</br>   just working so hard, I want to try and see if I can get my visa and be</br>   able to visit my parents.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Tell me about this company! What would your company be?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: [Laughs]. It's going to be, we call it a trading company because I</br>   know a lot of brands nationally that need to be expanded. And I also do a</br>   lot of business with China, and we import 80% of the things that we have in</br>   Mexico. There's a lot of people who have the money, they have the people</br>   who they're going to sell to, but they don't know, they don't have the</br>   knowledge on how to do it, how to import, process everything. So, I want to</br>   be able to help them out. So, not even just for me, but help brands grow,</br>   help other people develop their business, as well. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I'm excited to see, in a few years, how that comes across, and</br>   that's going to be incredible.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Thank you. It has to be. It has to be amazing! Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You're literally right now... like, oh, my gosh, you're an</br>   inspiration for me right now. [Ilse laughs]. I'm just going to start my</br>   third year of college now, and I can only dream of being where you're at</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, girl, thank you so much! And it's just like, you have to do what</br>   makes you happy. That's the only thing that I live by, you know? What makes</br>   you happy, and not like joder a las personas. Just do you, and help people</br>   out, and amazing things will happen. So, what you're doing right now is</br>   amazing. Thank you so much. I hadn't talked about my story of how I got</br>   there, not many people know, because it's weird and not people relate to it</br>   at all. They wouldn't understand.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I just have a few more questions that are more just of a</br>   reflection. The first, I guess in talking about returning, and the lack of</br>   government assistance, what do you think that the Mexican government can do</br>   to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: First of all, from the experience of being at the border…Because they</br>   deport people, you know? I think a few years back, they had flights to</br>   Mexico City, but they canceled that with the Trump administration. So now,</br>   they pretty much dump them on the border, and they have to see how they can</br>   find help. So, I think one of the things we have to strengthen is our part</br>   of the border. Help people in the border.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When I left, I remember how the Mexican government, the Mexican</br>   officials, they gave us a talk. Like, &quot;Oh, you're about to do something</br>   that's not right, but if it's your decision, we can't force you or stop you</br>   from doing it.&quot; Why not change that speech? Why not say, &quot;Don't leave. How</br>   can we help you so you won't leave?&quot; I mean, we could fix a problem from</br>   the root, why they're leaving. And then, when they do come back, analyze</br>   the people, make a profile—there's a lot of people that are being deported</br>   that have so much knowledge.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I just met this one guy who worked in interior design and</br>   construction all his life, and he has so much knowledge that he could help</br>   people out. We have kind of buildings all over the place, and there's</br>   always been something done in construction-wise. We help them out, you</br>   know? Lend them a hand, give them the tools to have their own company, to</br>   have what they had over there, and not make them feel restrained, or not</br>   make them feel that they're not part of the country when we're in the same</br>   boat.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I think we have to work on that. We have to work on having work</br>   opportunities not only in call centers. There's a lot of people who are too</br>   good to be in a call center, but that's all they can find because maybe</br>   they don't have a college degree, but they have experience. And I can tell</br>   you, and it still happens to me, when people... When I'm working, I do have</br>   to speak English sometimes, but when I'm in meetings with clients and</br>   things like that, it's just Spanish. And when they hear that I speak</br>   English or they talk about the States or something and I say that was there</br>   and things like that, and they ask me why I'm here, and just telling them,</br>   &quot;Oh, well, I came back because I wanted to.&quot; And then, them looking at me</br>   weird, like, &quot;Why would you come back if you were over there?&quot; Or when they</br>   ask, &quot;Did you have to come back because you were illegal?&quot; Dude, well,</br>   yeah, I came back because I couldn't stay over there, but you don't have to</br>   treat me differently.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And the type of people that I meet are people who have visas, who go</br>   back and forth, and they don't understand; &quot;Well, why don't you get a visa?</br>   Why did you leave without a visa?&quot; “No...” And I think changing that</br>   mindset, too, from the people that are here— the people that were born here</br>   and everything—there must be a way to make them understand that we're still</br>   Mexican. It wasn't our decision most of the time, why we had to leave. You</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I mean, I've been here for eight years, and it still happens</br>   sometimes. People just look at me weird because I came back. And I think</br>   the government has to have this type of organizations like New Comienzos so</br>   people can relate, so people can get out there. New Comienzos is amazing</br>   and everything, but a lot of people build their own community, and they're</br>   just together and not meeting other people out there. Maybe having a</br>   workshop or a hiring fair or exhibition for people that come back to find</br>   companies who need bilingual people specialized in certain areas. I think</br>   that would help, too. Just giving them more opportunities, I think, would</br>   be perfect.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And kind of along that same line, it's, what can the United States</br>   government do to help Mexican deportees and the family that they leave</br>   behind? What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, for one thing, a lot of people that are deported don't even</br>   have a criminal record. They don't have no background or anything that</br>   says, &quot;Oh, you're a bad person, and you can't be here.&quot; Maybe just really</br>   giving them a chance to—especially when you deport the dad, or the mom, and</br>   they leave their family behind. Like, why would you separate families? I</br>   mean, that's not even humanly fair. It's so unfair. It's so, so unfair.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I understand their ground, I understand that “Why would they be</br>   invaded by Mexicans?” But they also have to understand the situations here.</br>   Maybe work along, like I said, fix a problem from the root. I don't know.</br>   Both governments have to sit down and talk about this. Like right now, the</br>   importing tariff that was imposed of five percent on all the Mexican</br>   products being exported to the U.S. unless we stop the people crossing</br>   over. But if we had more opportunities and the governments both worked</br>   together to make the economy grow here and have more chances for them not</br>   to even think about leaving, it would change a lot. So, we have to analyze</br>   why people are leaving, and try to fix that problem. And they should work</br>   together. It sounds so easy, right? But it's so complicated. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah! I guess those are really all the questions that I had</br>   specifically, but I want to give you the chance now to say anything else</br>   that you think you may not have said, or anything else that you might want</br>   to add, if you want to.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, I just want to say thank you to you and everyone who's here to</br>   try to gather information to try and do something about the situation. I</br>   think that's so amazing, and I just... I don't know what we have to do.</br>   People who come back, or people who are thinking about coming back because</br>   they're not comfortable in the States, should be able to do it without a</br>   problem and feel safe that they are welcome here with open arms. And that</br>   they see that there's opportunities outside of the US, and that we can</br>   build a better economy here if a lot of people were still here, or people</br>   went to college.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I met this one guy who studied, well, he went to college in Texas,</br>   and he's working here for an HR company, but now he's going to work for</br>   Uber in Mexico. And I asked him, I'm like, &quot;Okay, you're from over</br>   there...&quot; He's Mexican, but he came back to work here. And he's like,</br>   &quot;Because I make dollars here. I spend in pesos. And it's a lot cheaper. I</br>   already bought my own apartment, I have my own car, I have all this,&quot; and</br>   it's like, yeah, we can do it here, you know? It's not impossible. I'm so</br>   grateful.

   government do to help Mexican deportees and the family that they leave<br>
   behind? What do you think?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: Well, for one thing, a lot of people that are deported don't even<br>
   have a criminal record. They don't have no background or anything that<br>
   says, &quot;Oh, you're a bad person, and you can't be here.&quot; Maybe just really<br>
   giving them a chance to—especially when you deport the dad, or the mom, and<br>
   they leave their family behind. Like, why would you separate families? I<br>
   mean, that's not even humanly fair. It's so unfair. It's so, so unfair.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: I understand their ground, I understand that “Why would they be<br>
   invaded by Mexicans?” But they also have to understand the situations here.<br>
   Maybe work along, like I said, fix a problem from the root. I don't know.<br>
   Both governments have to sit down and talk about this. Like right now, the<br>
   importing tariff that was imposed of five percent on all the Mexican<br>
   products being exported to the U.S. unless we stop the people crossing<br>
   over. But if we had more opportunities and the governments both worked<br>
   together to make the economy grow here and have more chances for them not<br>
   to even think about leaving, it would change a lot. So, we have to analyze<br>
   why people are leaving, and try to fix that problem. And they should work<br>
   together. It sounds so easy, right? But it's so complicated. [Laughs]<br>
 <br>

We have to work on having work<br>
   opportunities not only in call centers. There's a lot of people who are too<br>
   good to be in a call center, but that's all they can find because maybe<br>
   they don't have a college degree, but they have experience. And I can tell<br>
   you, and it still happens to me, when people... When I'm working, I do have<br>
   to speak English sometimes, but when I'm in meetings with clients and<br>
   things like that, it's just Spanish. And when they hear that I speak<br>
   English or they talk about the States or something and I say that was there<br>
   and things like that, and they ask me why I'm here, and just telling them,<br>
   &quot;Oh, well, I came back because I wanted to.&quot; And then, them looking at me<br>
   weird, like, &quot;Why would you come back if you were over there?&quot; Or when they<br>
   ask, &quot;Did you have to come back because you were illegal?&quot; Dude, well,<br>
   yeah, I came back because I couldn't stay over there, but you don't have to<br>
   treat me differently.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: And the type of people that I meet are people who have visas, who go<br>
   back and forth, and they don't understand; &quot;Well, why don't you get a visa?<br>
   Why did you leave without a visa?&quot; “No...” And I think changing that<br>
   mindset, too, from the people that are here— the people that were born here<br>
   and everything—there must be a way to make them understand that we're still<br>
   Mexican. It wasn't our decision most of the time, why we had to leave. You<br>
   know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>

   deport people, you know? I think a few years back, they had flights to<br>
   Mexico City, but they canceled that with the Trump administration. So now,<br>
   they pretty much dump them on the border, and they have to see how they can<br>
   find help. So, I think one of the things we have to strengthen is our part<br>
   of the border. Help people in the border.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: When I left, I remember how the Mexican government, the Mexican<br>
   officials, they gave us a talk. Like, &quot;Oh, you're about to do something<br>
   that's not right, but if it's your decision, we can't force you or stop you<br>
   from doing it.&quot; Why not change that speech? Why not say, &quot;Don't leave. How<br>
   can we help you so you won't leave?&quot; I mean, we could fix a problem from<br>
   the root, why they're leaving. And then, when they do come back, analyze<br>
   the people, make a profile—there's a lot of people that are being deported<br>
   that have so much knowledge.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: Okay, well, right now, one of the things, meeting New Comienzos and<br>
   everything that they do, I want to help people. I know how tough it is to<br>
   come back, I know everything that you have to go through. I want to be<br>
   someone who helps them out. I don't know how, but that's one of the things<br>
   right now.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: I'm working on establishing my own company. I'm really excited about<br>
   that. I want to have something of my own, and I'm talking about short-term.<br>
   I want to start it already because I know so many people, I have all this<br>
   knowledge, I have everything. I just need to do it, you know? [Chuckle].<br>
   And that's one of my objectives…dreams. It's always been a dream to have my<br>
   own company, but now, I have to make it a reality, and I have to work up to<br>
   that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: I want to get married someday. [Laughs]. I've been single ever since<br>
   I came back. On a personal note, that would be amazing. And right now, I'm<br>
   just working so hard, I want to try and see if I can get my visa and be<br>
   able to visit my parents.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Tell me about this company! What would your company be?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: [Laughs]. It's going to be, we call it a trading company because I<br>
   know a lot of brands nationally that need to be expanded. And I also do a<br>
   lot of business with China, and we import 80% of the things that we have in<br>
   Mexico. There's a lot of people who have the money, they have the people<br>
   who they're going to sell to, but they don't know, they don't have the<br>
   knowledge on how to do it, how to import, process everything. So, I want to<br>
   be able to help them out. So, not even just for me, but help brands grow,<br>
   help other people develop their business, as well. Yeah.<br>

   you know? And then, I was so angry because they took me over there, and I<br>
   tried so hard, and I wanted to stay over there, and I had to come back.<br>
   I've had to change. I'm not trying to be like, &quot;Oh, poor me,&quot; and people<br>
   feel pity for me or anything at all, but it's just like, why can't a person<br>
   just live, and be where they want to be? That just gets to me. It’s not<br>
   like I'm mad at the US, or I'm mad at my parents because they took me, I'm<br>
   just mad that people have to go through that, you know? Just to run away<br>
   from things, as kids. Because I know there's millions and thousands,<br>
   thousands, of kids that have to do what their parents tell them. But I'm<br>
   happy in Mexico, I can tell you that. It was probably the best decision<br>
   that I could have made. I don't know what would have happened if I had<br>
   stayed over there. Who knows?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: But I think it was a good decision, and mainly because I was so<br>
   dedicated, and I always knew what I wanted, and I worked so hard for it. I<br>
   didn't give up. I think that's the difference. And bumping into so many<br>
   amazing people who have been there for me, who have helped me. Like my boss<br>
   right now, sometimes he's kind of like my dad, you know? He knows my story,<br>
   and he helps me so much, and he tells me, &quot;You're going to see your parents<br>
   again, and I'm going to make sure, and I'm going to help you, and I don't<br>

   always so overprotected—my dad was overprotective of me in the States, and<br>
   I wasn't able to go out or anything—honestly, the first year, two years, I<br>
   was free, you know? [Laughs]. I could do whatever I wanted, I lived on my<br>
   own, you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: But then it just got to me. The third year was so bad. So bad because<br>
   there was a point in time that I had economic issues, and had to reach out<br>
   to my parents, and I was like, &quot;Help me out a little bit?&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>

   anything about it, you know? I can't call my mom and tell her that I'm sad<br>

   would always get there at eight. I would organize my calls, and at nine, I<br>

   everything. Everything regarding the company. And I'm just so grateful, I'm<br>
   so happy there, you have no idea. I've been able to travel to China twice<br>

   many important people, so many important... Forever 21, for instance. We're<br>
   trying to do services for them.<br>

   that maybe I wasn't supposed to stay over there. Maybe it was just a little<br>
   help, to try and be to where I am today. But still, I know there's<br>
   opportunities in Mexico. I barely learned about New Comienzos a month ago.<br>

   to be over there. We can do so many things here. And we can prove that<br>

But it got to a point that I finally</br>   understood that it was never going to happen because it's so expensive. I</br>   couldn't go to a community college, I couldn't go—which was never my idea.</br>   I couldn't go to a four-year college because it was so expensive, and the</br>   scholarships are limited for people like me who were undocumented. When I</br>   finally got that, it just broke my heart because I was like, &quot;I've tried so</br>   hard. I've given it everything, and I'm still not going to be able to stay</br>   here.&quot; So, one day, I talked to my dad and I said, &quot;Dad, I really, really</br>   want to go to college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And he's like, &quot;But I can't do it. I can't pay for it. It's too</br>   expensive.&quot; And he's like, &quot;You either stay here and work, and try to go</br>   whenever you save up, or you go back to Mexico.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And I thought about it. I was like, &quot;Well, Mexico's my country, my</br>   dad's telling me to pretty much leave and he's not going to support me, so</br>   might as well just leave.&quot; So, right after college [means, high school] I</br>   graduated June 11th in 2011, and I was back to Mexico July second in 2011.</br>   And I just decided to leave, to start over.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="49816813-f6b2-4b47-9502-73d184c5ef94" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Paying For, No hope for a future in the US, Higher Education in Mexico">Claudia: So, you pretty much just came by yourself? You made that decision?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: I did. I was 18, and I said to myself, &quot;If you have this one dream,<br>
   you're not going to be limited as to where you are. If you want to be<br>
   someone, you're going to be someone anywhere in the world.&quot; So, I just<br>
   said, &quot;Okay, I'm going to leave.&quot; And I left my parents and my brother, and<br>
   I've been here in Mexico for almost eight years now.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: I was very lucky too on that perspective because, like I said, when<br>
   we got there, it was a really small community, and my school only had a few<br>
   Latin people. But the school actually had teachers, English teachers. They<br>
   were so nice to me, and I was able to get one-on-one classes, and it was so<br>
   personalized, and they were so committed. Even my regular teacher, she was<br>
   Ms. ___, and I'll never forget her. She was so nice to me, and she would<br>
   help me so much. I've always been a really good student, and I always<br>
   wanted my grades, and do good in everything. And I was really good in math,<br>
   obviously because it was numbers, and I was always top in that area, in<br>
   that subject. But then when it came to reading and everything, it was kind<br>
   of complicated, so she helped me so much. She paid so much attention to me,<br>
   and thank God, I was able to learn the language in a few months thanks to<br>
   them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: And thanks to my dad pushing me, too, because there were things that<br>
   we had to do, and he didn't have a translator. So, I had to do it for him.<br>
   That helped out a lot. So, I would say I learned in nine months tops.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span><span id="eccd6b0b-7b43-4c09-b7da-0ca9462885bc" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Migration from Mexico, Border crossing, Border patrol, Mexico, Before the US, Family Relationships, Time in the US, Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Family reunification">Ilse: So, then we found out my brother was over there already. He was in<br>
   Texas, I think; I don't even know. And my mom was like, &quot;We have to do it<br>
   again. We have to try because your brother's over there, because your dad's<br>
   already waiting for us.&quot; So, we didn't have any money, we didn't have<br>
   anything, but the woman that we were with, she still had some money. So, we<br>
   went over to a motel—and this is where I'm always grateful, and God is<br>
   like... or I have this huge angel or something.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: The owners of the motel kind of heard the story when my mom was<br>
   talking to my dad on the phone, and they said that they knew these people<br>
   that faked the visas, or passports, and we could do it with them. And so,<br>
   my mom talked to my dad and everything, and so, we were in training for two<br>
   days, learning somebody else's identity. Name, everything, you have to know<br>
   everything about the person, or at least the basics. It had to be in<br>
   English, and I didn't know any English, or my mom didn't know any<br>
   English—she's so bad at that. [Chuckles]. So we kept practicing and<br>
   practicing, and I finally got it, right? So, I was good to go. And then my<br>
   mom, she had a really, really hard time. Really hard time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: The day came when we had to actually do it. A slight happy moment<br>
   that I had was when they brought me clothes, because you have to look good,<br>
   you have to look like you were normal, I guess. So, I got new clothes, and<br>
   I was so happy because it had been three horrible weeks before that, and<br>
   then just getting that was really nice. And the people were so nice to me,<br>
   so nice.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: So, we get to the border on a van, and they're like, &quot;Okay, so,<br>
   everyone's going to separate, everyone is going to go their own way, and<br>
   we'll see you guys when we cross.&quot; So, we were on our own. And I remember<br>
   asking my mom, &quot;Mom, just tell me a little bit, what's your story?&quot; And she<br>
   just blacked out. She didn't know anything. Like, she just went blank, her<br>
   mind went blank. I was like, &quot;Oh, my God, no. This is going to be so bad.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: So, this is again where God is amazing, or whatever, because when it<br>
   was going to be our turn where you give the papers and they ask you these<br>
   questions, the guy in front of us was caught. So, a bunch of officers went<br>
   over to him, and started asking him all these questions, so I just grabbed<br>
   my mom's hand and I'm like, &quot;Mom, let's just go.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: We walked, and they didn't ask any questions, nothing. We just<br>
   walked, and we were in the US. And that was a relief because I didn't want<br>
   to go through the other thing all over again. [Chuckle]. To this day, I<br>
   swear I don't know how that happened. And I'm just so grateful because, I<br>
   mean, we were able to do it that easy, you know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: My mom's always telling me this. When you do good things in life, and<br>
   you're a good person, good things happen to you. And ever since then, I've<br>
   been so grateful for that opportunity that I just try to be good to people<br>
   and I just try to do good things, you know? So, I guess that can come back<br>
   to me? And yeah, but that's how we got to the US, and then we got on a<br>
   van...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: Well, then we met up with my brother. That was the best moment, when<br>
   I saw my brother, because he's always been everything to me, always, and<br>
   just being able to see him and hug him and everything, that was the best<br>
   moment. And then, we got on the van, and it took us around three days, two<br>
   days, I honestly don't remember, to get to North Carolina. And, yeah. Then<br>
   united with my dad, and that's it. That's the story of how we got there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

   caught us, and they said that we're violating US laws. They were so rude,<br>
   so rude, I swear. And then they were like—I mean, I know I was a little<br>
   girl, but I could understand what they were telling my mom, you know?—and<br>
   they were just like, angry at her, too, because, &quot;How could you ever even<br>
   think that your daughter... and she's so young...&quot; Apparently, I looked<br>
   really sick. [Chuckles].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: And so, they just got us on the vans, and we went to the border<br>
   prison. I was in prison for some time. Well, a day. [Chuckles]. And then,<br>
   they took us back to the border and we had to start all over again. And it<br>
   was just so sad and depressing, because the way we tried and everything we<br>
   went through. That's why I was so angry when I got over there, because no<br>
   human being should have to go through so much just so they could change<br>
   their economic status, or just so they could run away from problems that<br>
   you can't control.<br>
 <br>

   and we tried to cross the border through the desert. But it was awful. Even<br>
   being at the border, waiting for the instructions to go ahead and start the<br>
   journey, you know? And seeing so many people, and kids, and women... It was<br>
   just so bad, you know? And those images are so vivid in my head still. Then<br>
   after that, we were lost in the desert for three days. We ran out of water,<br>
   we ran out of food, we ran out of everything; the coyote got lost. And<br>
   there was a point... when it rains in the desert, it's so bad. Like, the<br>
   thunderstorms are so, so bad. I'll never forget how this woman that was<br>
   traveling with us, she was like hallucinating, I guess. It was so bad that<br>
   it was raining and that there was a thunderstorm, and she thought that this<br>
   one cactus was a person.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: So, she almost fell, so she thought she was going to grab onto<br>
   someone, and she grabbed onto the cactus, and all her body was left with<br>
   the little pikes. It was so bad, and then being lost…<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: We knew that they were going to be looking for us, obviously, or<br>
   someone out there, so we just decided to wait. We waited it out. But before<br>
   that, when it was raining, too... This was like a breaking point. There was<br>
   a little, small creek, or little river, I guess you could say. When there's<br>
   a thunderstorm and it's so dark, the thunder and then you're blacked out,<br>
   you're blinded because of the light. And then, we lost track of the people.<br>
   So, my mom and I got lost, right?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: So, we had to cross the little creek thing, and then my mom just<br>
   slipped, and she was about to just keep going with the flow, and I was<br>
   so... God is amazing, because I just can't believe He gave me the strength,<br>
   you know, to save my mom. And this man came back for us. It's just so<br>
   crazy, because who does that, you know? Who actually comes back to check on<br>
   people when you have to take care of yourself? He helped us, we crossed it,<br>
   but we were still lost. So, once again, we got to a point where, like,<br>
   &quot;Okay, we're going to wait it out.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: But it rained so hard, and it was so hot, and we didn't have anything<br>
   to eat or no water, and then I was just like blacked out. My mom says that<br>
   I was gone for hours, and I was hallucinating, and literally, she thought I<br>
   was going to die because it was so bad. So, the men that were with us, they<br>
   went out looking for water or something, and they came across this—they<br>
   said it was kind of like a pond kind of thing, but it was more like animal<br>
   pee and, I don't know. So, they brought that back. My mom still had some<br>
   limes, and my mom put lime in it, and she kept trying to get me water, and<br>
   that's how like, I came back apparently. That's what she said. I don't<br>
   remember anything about that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: So, the coyote comes back, and he's like, &quot;Okay, I found out a way.<br>
   We're good to go. We just got to keep walking.&quot; And that was the third day.<br>
   And so, we kept walking, and I don't know where we hear the helicopter, and<br>
   we hear the vans, and dogs, and they caught us, you know? We were so close.<br>
   So close. And yet so far, literally.<br>
 <br>

   siblings, with a coyote or did you just go by yourselves?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: My dad had a friend in the States, and he had family in Guerrero. So,<br>
   they're like, &quot;So you guys won’t come alone, meet up with that family, so<br>
   you can all come over.&quot; And so, we met this family. It was a mom with a<br>
   son—he's older than me for about two years, I think, and a girl. She was,<br>
   at that time, she was like five, I think. She was so small.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: My brother, he was seven at the time; so he's younger than me. And<br>
   so, we met up in the city and we traveled to the border. The plan was to<br>
   cross the border through the desert, all of us, with a coyote. But my<br>
   brother and the little girl were too young. I was too young, too, but I<br>
   didn't want to leave my mom. So, they separated us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: My brother went with this other family, who took care of him, and he<br>
   crossed the border asleep in a car, which was... it was, I want to say<br>
   easy, but after hearing his story, and how he had to suffer because these<br>
   people hit him, and you know, abused him, because he couldn't do anything.<br>
   People were just mean to him, and he was trying to protect the little girl,<br>
   that then I understood that it wasn't easy for him, either.<br>

   look at you like if you were some kind of alien, because they've never seen<br>

   Ilse: Definitely! [Laughs]. You see, I was very angry from the time my mom<br>
   told me that we had to leave Mexico. I was happy in Mexico. I have a lot of<br>
   friends. I mean, I was only nine, but when you're nine, especially I think<br>
   prior to this generation, you're very aware; at least, my mom always made<br>
   me like that. She'd educated me to always be independent, and to always<br>
   work hard at everything that I did. Obviously, at that time, I only went to<br>
   school, right? But I also sold candy outside of my house so I could help my<br>
   mom out a little bit, and I did so well in school, you know? I was so<br>
   happy. I actually got a scholarship being in Mexico so I could keep going<br>
   to school. I had straight A's. You know?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Ilse: And just out of nowhere, my mom coming up to me and saying, &quot;You're<br>
   going to have to leave everything behind because we're going to go see your<br>
   dad,&quot; that was just so shocking for me. And then, the whole journey to get<br>
   to the US, which I'll never forget, and it's... I really pray that no<br>
   nine-year-old ever has to go through that type of stuff. And then, getting<br>
   to the US and not knowing anyone, and feeling totally out of place, and<br>
   that first day was just so awful for me.<br>

I arrived to the US when it</br>   was still summer vacations, had two weeks left of vacations before I</br>   started going to school.

We just got to keep walking.&quot; And that was the third day.</br>   And so, we kept walking, and I don't know where we hear the helicopter, and</br>   we hear the vans, and dogs, and they caught us, you know? We were so close.</br>   So close. And yet so far, literally.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, my mom just hugged me and she's like, &quot;The first thing you're</br>   going to do is you're going to run to the water.&quot; And, yeah. So, they</br>   caught us, and they said that we're violating US laws. They were so rude,</br>   so rude, I swear. And then they were like—I mean, I know I was a little</br>   girl, but I could understand what they were telling my mom, you know?—and</br>   they were just like, angry at her, too, because, &quot;How could you ever even</br>   think that your daughter... and she's so young...&quot; Apparently, I looked</br>   really sick. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And so, they just got us on the vans, and we went to the border</br>   prison. I was in prison for some time. Well, a day. [Chuckles]. And then,</br>   they took us back to the border and we had to start all over again. And it</br>   was just so sad and depressing, because the way we tried and everything we</br>   went through. That's why I was so angry when I got over there, because no</br>   human being should have to go through so much just so they could change</br>   their economic status, or just so they could run away from problems that</br>   you can't control.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, then we found out my brother was over there already. He was in</br>   Texas, I think; I don't even know. And my mom was like, &quot;We have to do it</br>   again. We have to try because your brother's over there, because your dad's</br>   already waiting for us.&quot; So, we didn't have any money, we didn't have</br>   anything, but the woman that we were with, she still had some money. So, we</br>   went over to a motel—and this is where I'm always grateful, and God is</br>   like... or I have this huge angel or something.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: The owners of the motel kind of heard the story when my mom was</br>   talking to my dad on the phone, and they said that they knew these people</br>   that faked the visas, or passports, and we could do it with them. And so,</br>   my mom talked to my dad and everything, and so, we were in training for two</br>   days, learning somebody else's identity. Name, everything, you have to know</br>   everything about the person, or at least the basics. It had to be in</br>   English, and I didn't know any English, or my mom didn't know any</br>   English—she's so bad at that. [Chuckles]. So we kept practicing and</br>   practicing, and I finally got it, right? So, I was good to go. And then my</br>   mom, she had a really, really hard time. Really hard time.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: The day came when we had to actually do it. A slight happy moment</br>   that I had was when they brought me clothes, because you have to look good,</br>   you have to look like you were normal, I guess. So, I got new clothes, and</br>   I was so happy because it had been three horrible weeks before that, and</br>   then just getting that was really nice. And the people were so nice to me,</br>   so nice.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, we get to the border on a van, and they're like, &quot;Okay, so,</br>   everyone's going to separate, everyone is going to go their own way, and</br>   we'll see you guys when we cross.&quot; So, we were on our own. And I remember</br>   asking my mom, &quot;Mom, just tell me a little bit, what's your story?&quot; And she</br>   just blacked out. She didn't know anything. Like, she just went blank, her</br>   mind went blank. I was like, &quot;Oh, my God, no. This is going to be so bad.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: So, this is again where God is amazing, or whatever, because when it</br>   was going to be our turn where you give the papers and they ask you these</br>   questions, the guy in front of us was caught. So, a bunch of officers went</br>   over to him, and started asking him all these questions, so I just grabbed</br>   my mom's hand and I'm like, &quot;Mom, let's just go.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: We walked, and they didn't ask any questions, nothing. We just</br>   walked, and we were in the US. And that was a relief because I didn't want</br>   to go through the other thing all over again. [Chuckle]. To this day, I</br>   swear I don't know how that happened. And I'm just so grateful because, I</br>   mean, we were able to do it that easy, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: My mom's always telling me this. When you do good things in life, and</br>   you're a good person, good things happen to you. And ever since then, I've</br>   been so grateful for that opportunity that I just try to be good to people</br>   and I just try to do good things, you know? So, I guess that can come back</br>   to me? And yeah, but that's how we got to the US, and then we got on a</br>   van...</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, then we met up with my brother. That was the best moment, when</br>   I saw my brother, because he's always been everything to me, always, and</br>   just being able to see him and hug him and everything, that was the best</br>   moment. And then, we got on the van, and it took us around three days, two</br>   days, I honestly don't remember, to get to North Carolina. And, yeah. Then</br>   united with my dad, and that's it. That's the story of how we got there.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: The perseverance is just amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Where you have to keep going…</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, how did you learn English? Did you go to school?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was very lucky too on that perspective because, like I said, when</br>   we got there, it was a really small community, and my school only had a few</br>   Latin people. But the school actually had teachers, English teachers. They</br>   were so nice to me, and I was able to get one-on-one classes, and it was so</br>   personalized, and they were so committed. Even my regular teacher, she was</br>   Ms. ___, and I'll never forget her. She was so nice to me, and she would</br>   help me so much. I've always been a really good student, and I always</br>   wanted my grades, and do good in everything. And I was really good in math,</br>   obviously because it was numbers, and I was always top in that area, in</br>   that subject. But then when it came to reading and everything, it was kind</br>   of complicated, so she helped me so much. She paid so much attention to me,</br>   and thank God, I was able to learn the language in a few months thanks to</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And thanks to my dad pushing me, too, because there were things that</br>   we had to do, and he didn't have a translator. So, I had to do it for him.</br>   That helped out a lot. So, I would say I learned in nine months tops.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, were you able to maintain those grades that you had had in</br>   Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes. Well, fourth grade, obviously, my first year, I had a couple</br>   D's; I never had an F ever, ever. But, yeah, I tried so hard. I've always</br>   tried so hard.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Because pretty much, like I said, I tried so hard, but my biggest</br>   dream growing up and going to school is I'm going to school and I'm going</br>   to do so good because I want to go to college. I want to have a degree, and</br>   I want to be able to help people. I want to represent Mexico because just—I</br>   love the States because of everything that it gave me, but the way that it</br>   happened, it was so hard on me, and I always wanted to prove that Mexicans</br>   can do good, and good things, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And so, going to high school, I tried really hard, I had really good</br>   grades, I graduated third in my class. I was so into volunteering, I was in</br>   the student council, I did sports, I did everything. I wanted to be perfect</br>   so I could get scholarships. But it got to a point that I finally</br>   understood that it was never going to happen because it's so expensive. I</br>   couldn't go to a community college, I couldn't go—which was never my idea.</br>   I couldn't go to a four-year college because it was so expensive, and the</br>   scholarships are limited for people like me who were undocumented. When I</br>   finally got that, it just broke my heart because I was like, &quot;I've tried so</br>   hard. I've given it everything, and I'm still not going to be able to stay</br>   here.&quot; So, one day, I talked to my dad and I said, &quot;Dad, I really, really</br>   want to go to college.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And he's like, &quot;But I can't do it. I can't pay for it. It's too</br>   expensive.&quot; And he's like, &quot;You either stay here and work, and try to go</br>   whenever you save up, or you go back to Mexico.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And I thought about it. I was like, &quot;Well, Mexico's my country, my</br>   dad's telling me to pretty much leave and he's not going to support me, so</br>   might as well just leave.&quot; So, right after college [means, high school] I</br>   graduated June 11th in 2011, and I was back to Mexico July second in 2011.</br>   And I just decided to leave, to start over.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, you pretty much just came by yourself? You made that decision?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I did. I was 18, and I said to myself, &quot;If you have this one dream,</br>   you're not going to be limited as to where you are. If you want to be</br>   someone, you're going to be someone anywhere in the world.&quot; So, I just</br>   said, &quot;Okay, I'm going to leave.&quot; And I left my parents and my brother, and</br>   I've been here in Mexico for almost eight years now.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: For almost 10 years?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Eight years? Eight years, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And this, I'm just going to go back for a second. Did you ever</br>   think about applying for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: DACA was not available at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: DACA was implemented in 2012, and I came back 2011.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah. Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: [Laughs]. Everything happens for a reason, and I'm so sure about</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And so, you've been back eight years. How has being back in Mexico</br>   been? How was that transition coming in, what did you do, who did you meet</br>   up with, what did you do or what are you doing now?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, I came back. One of my aunts, my dad's sister, greeted me. She</br>   opened her doors to her house, and I lived with them for six months. I came</br>   back July second and I had a job in August. Pretty much everyone, the only</br>   opportunities that we have here as returnees and everything, is call</br>   centers. So, I started working at a call center. I had a really hard time.</br>   No, not this one, Tevista. Telvista was the first call center I went to.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: It was just a relief being able to find a job so fast, but it's not</br>   something that I loved. It was really tough, but it was a relief at the</br>   same time because I was going to be able to meet people and everything.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When you come back from the States and you went to high school, and</br>   you want to validate that you actually finished high school, you have to do</br>   certain process in Mexico. I knew that before I came back; I tried to get</br>   all my documents ready and everything, but the system here is so slow, and</br>   I still had to lose a year of college, and I couldn't go because my</br>   paperwork wasn't turned in.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was able to apply to a public college, Instituto Politécnico</br>   Nacional. I made it, but the classes and everything didn't give me time to</br>   work, and at the time, I had agreed with my dad that I wasn't ever going to</br>   ask for any help, like monetary help. So, I decided to decline that, and</br>   look for a private college. And I did. I found a really good college who</br>   allowed me, they allowed me to work full-time and go to college full-time.</br>   So, I majored in international business and commerce, my dream career, and</br>   I went to college for four years while working.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When I was in Telvista, I started as a CSR, just answering calls, and</br>   became mentor, and then I was a supervisor at 19, which was really hard</br>   experience—it was so tough—but at the same time, it helped me so much and</br>   it gave me the basics to work and be able to do what I do now. Then I</br>   worked for the Western Union Corporate, the one that they have here in</br>   Mexico. I was in Telvista for two years and a half, then Western Union for</br>   a year and a half, and then I was sick and tired of call centers, I didn't</br>   want to do that anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And, I'm so persistent, and my tenacity is always up here, you know?</br>   And I was like, &quot;Nope, I'm done with this. I need to do something that</br>   involves my career.&quot; So, when I was in sixth semester, I tried to look for</br>   a job regarding my major, and I was able to find a job. But it was more</br>   like an intern job, so I was so blessed because I had savings, you know, so</br>   I was able to take it. But they paid so little! [Laughs]. It was awful!</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But I'm so grateful for that opportunity, because that company that</br>   hired me, it was a fusion. They were two companies, a company that was</br>   based in China, in Shanghai, for inspection services, and an international</br>   logistics company that took care of [inaudible 00:26:06] and the customs</br>   clearance and everything. When I first got there, I went to the logistics</br>   one, which involved me selling international transportation. I had no idea;</br>   I had no training. I tried so hard but honestly, I did a really bad job.</br>   [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But the other company's director, he saw how pushy I was, how</br>   dedicated I was—I mean, I'm talking about, the normal hours to come into</br>   work were at nine, and I signed my contract to go from nine to four, but I</br>   would always get there at eight. I would organize my calls, and at nine, I</br>   was calling, prospecting, and everything. And he saw my dedication, and</br>   three months after my hiring, he offered me a position at the inspections</br>   company. And that was just life-changing because after that, he obviously</br>   raised my salary.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: He is an amazing boss. He's still my boss until today. After a year</br>   and a half, been with both, the fusion of the company, he decides to</br>   separate. So, we went from being the company department to being a company.</br>   So, I've been able to help him out with the whole... from logo, from</br>   everything. Everything regarding the company. And I'm just so grateful, I'm</br>   so happy there, you have no idea. I've been able to travel to China twice</br>   already. I travel in Mexico City so much. I've met so many people, the</br>   China chamber, the Mexico City chamber, so many important organizations, so</br>   many important people, so many important... Forever 21, for instance. We're</br>   trying to do services for them.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And it was just so amazing. Everything happens for a reason. I know</br>   that maybe I wasn't supposed to stay over there. Maybe it was just a little</br>   help, to try and be to where I am today. But still, I know there's</br>   opportunities in Mexico. I barely learned about New Comienzos a month ago.</br>   And I just want to tell people and help them understand that we don't have</br>   to be over there. We can do so many things here. And we can prove that</br>   they're missing out! [Laughs]. Because I could have done all this for a</br>   company that is based over there, but obviously, well, that was impossible,</br>   so I'm here.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You didn't receive any help from the government when you came</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Any help from any non-government?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No. Nothing.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Nothing. Okay. I'm assuming, but just let me know, is your family</br>   still in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes, they are.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Have you seen them?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I have not seen them in eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, tell me about that, if you feel comfortable.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: It's tough, it's so tough. I've always been so close to my mom and my</br>   brother, you have no idea. The first few years, I guess, because I was</br>   always so overprotected—my dad was overprotective of me in the States, and</br>   I wasn't able to go out or anything—honestly, the first year, two years, I</br>   was free, you know? [Laughs]. I could do whatever I wanted, I lived on my</br>   own, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But then it just got to me. The third year was so bad. So bad because</br>   there was a point in time that I had economic issues, and had to reach out</br>   to my parents, and I was like, &quot;Help me out a little bit?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But it was more than not having enough money or whatever, it was just</br>   not having my mom by my side, telling me everything was going to be okay.</br>   And I mean, so far, I never tell them my problems because they can't do</br>   anything about it, you know? I can't call my mom and tell her that I'm sad</br>   or that I'm... I don't know, because she can't do anything. She's so far.</br>   [Emotional]. I'm so sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. Take your time.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And my brother got married a year ago. I wasn't able to be there. You</br>   know? [Crying]. I'm so sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: He's always been my everything, and it was so hard not to be there</br>   for him. And, well, he's going to be a dad. And I'm not going to be able to</br>   see my little niece. Oh, sorry, it's just like...But I know we'll be</br>   together someday, and I'm working so hard because I know I'm not a bad</br>   person. I think that I should be able to get a visa to be able to go back.</br>   I'm not going to stay, you know? I just want to see my family. I'm so</br>   sorry. [Crying].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. It's totally okay.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah. But, yeah, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, their plan is to stay in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yep. Sorry. [Chuckles while crying].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Don't worry. We can take a few minutes.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No, no, it's fine.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You're totally fine, it's normal.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And thank you for sharing.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: No, it's just like... I don't talk about this at all, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I can't even imagine. I guess right now, I'm going through the</br>   period where I've been separated from my family for the longest, because</br>   I'm studying in the States but I'm from Puerto Rico.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, I'm the only person in my family who's in the States right</br>   now, but I just can't even imagine being separated from them for that long.</br>   I also have, I'm the oldest of three, so it's also feeling like you have</br>   that responsibility towards your siblings—</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Exactly, yeah. Yeah, true.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And you want to help out your family, and so, that's why I'm</br>   studying over there, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, that's so nice. That's amazing. That's amazing, yeah. But you</br>   kind of understand. [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: But I know that you're going to see them again, and I'm sure that</br>   they're so proud of you, because honestly, everything that you've told me</br>   so far is just so amazing. Like, damn, girl!</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, thank you...[Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: If you had asked me a few years ago, I would be confused, but I can</br>   tell you now that I'm Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And you mentioned a little earlier in the beginning that you were</br>   angry of leaving the US because you loved Mexico and you wanted to stay</br>   here. Do you still feel that way now that you're back?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I was angry when I had to go to the US because I had everything here,</br>   you know? And then, I was so angry because they took me over there, and I</br>   tried so hard, and I wanted to stay over there, and I had to come back.</br>   I've had to change. I'm not trying to be like, &quot;Oh, poor me,&quot; and people</br>   feel pity for me or anything at all, but it's just like, why can't a person</br>   just live, and be where they want to be? That just gets to me. It’s not</br>   like I'm mad at the US, or I'm mad at my parents because they took me, I'm</br>   just mad that people have to go through that, you know? Just to run away</br>   from things, as kids. Because I know there's millions and thousands,</br>   thousands, of kids that have to do what their parents tell them. But I'm</br>   happy in Mexico, I can tell you that. It was probably the best decision</br>   that I could have made. I don't know what would have happened if I had</br>   stayed over there. Who knows?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: But I think it was a good decision, and mainly because I was so</br>   dedicated, and I always knew what I wanted, and I worked so hard for it. I</br>   didn't give up. I think that's the difference. And bumping into so many</br>   amazing people who have been there for me, who have helped me. Like my boss</br>   right now, sometimes he's kind of like my dad, you know? He knows my story,</br>   and he helps me so much, and he tells me, &quot;You're going to see your parents</br>   again, and I'm going to make sure, and I'm going to help you, and I don't</br>   know what we're going to have to do, but you're going to see them again.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And just bumping into people like that is just amazing, and I'm just</br>   so grateful. I always say that I'm so overly blessed, honestly. I really</br>   am. And I'm happy here. I'm happy in my country, I'm happy being free; not</br>   being scared that at any given time someone's going to come and take me.</br>   I'm just free.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, just I guess hypothetically, if you could have stayed in the</br>   US, what do you think you would have done?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I would have went to college, obviously. I actually wanted to go to</br>   Salem College. I don't know if you've heard about it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I tried, and they tried to help me so much so I could go, but it was</br>   still very expensive. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, you got in?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yeah, I was accepted.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You were accepted.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Yes, I was. But again, I couldn't stay. And I would have gone to</br>   college, same major, that's what I wanted, and worked for an international</br>   logistics company, and do what I do. [Chuckles]. And be happy. And</br>   obviously, being close to my parents—not even, parents are obviously</br>   important, but my mom and my brother who are like everything to me, you</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Obviously, now that you're back, you've already done so many</br>   amazing things, but what are your dreams? What else would you like to do</br>   while you're here?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Okay, well, right now, one of the things, meeting New Comienzos and</br>   everything that they do, I want to help people. I know how tough it is to</br>   come back, I know everything that you have to go through. I want to be</br>   someone who helps them out. I don't know how, but that's one of the things</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I'm working on establishing my own company. I'm really excited about</br>   that. I want to have something of my own, and I'm talking about short-term.</br>   I want to start it already because I know so many people, I have all this</br>   knowledge, I have everything. I just need to do it, you know? [Chuckle].</br>   And that's one of my objectives…dreams. It's always been a dream to have my</br>   own company, but now, I have to make it a reality, and I have to work up to</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I want to get married someday. [Laughs]. I've been single ever since</br>   I came back. On a personal note, that would be amazing. And right now, I'm</br>   just working so hard, I want to try and see if I can get my visa and be</br>   able to visit my parents.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Tell me about this company! What would your company be?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: [Laughs]. It's going to be, we call it a trading company because I</br>   know a lot of brands nationally that need to be expanded. And I also do a</br>   lot of business with China, and we import 80% of the things that we have in</br>   Mexico. There's a lot of people who have the money, they have the people</br>   who they're going to sell to, but they don't know, they don't have the</br>   knowledge on how to do it, how to import, process everything. So, I want to</br>   be able to help them out. So, not even just for me, but help brands grow,</br>   help other people develop their business, as well. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I'm excited to see, in a few years, how that comes across, and</br>   that's going to be incredible.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Thank you. It has to be. It has to be amazing! Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You're literally right now... like, oh, my gosh, you're an</br>   inspiration for me right now. [Ilse laughs]. I'm just going to start my</br>   third year of college now, and I can only dream of being where you're at</br>   right now.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Oh, girl, thank you so much! And it's just like, you have to do what</br>   makes you happy. That's the only thing that I live by, you know? What makes</br>   you happy, and not like joder a las personas. Just do you, and help people</br>   out, and amazing things will happen. So, what you're doing right now is</br>   amazing. Thank you so much. I hadn't talked about my story of how I got</br>   there, not many people know, because it's weird and not people relate to it</br>   at all. They wouldn't understand.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I just have a few more questions that are more just of a</br>   reflection. The first, I guess in talking about returning, and the lack of</br>   government assistance, what do you think that the Mexican government can do</br>   to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: First of all, from the experience of being at the border…Because they</br>   deport people, you know? I think a few years back, they had flights to</br>   Mexico City, but they canceled that with the Trump administration. So now,</br>   they pretty much dump them on the border, and they have to see how they can</br>   find help. So, I think one of the things we have to strengthen is our part</br>   of the border. Help people in the border.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: When I left, I remember how the Mexican government, the Mexican</br>   officials, they gave us a talk. Like, &quot;Oh, you're about to do something</br>   that's not right, but if it's your decision, we can't force you or stop you</br>   from doing it.&quot; Why not change that speech? Why not say, &quot;Don't leave. How</br>   can we help you so you won't leave?&quot; I mean, we could fix a problem from</br>   the root, why they're leaving. And then, when they do come back, analyze</br>   the people, make a profile—there's a lot of people that are being deported</br>   that have so much knowledge.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I just met this one guy who worked in interior design and</br>   construction all his life, and he has so much knowledge that he could help</br>   people out. We have kind of buildings all over the place, and there's</br>   always been something done in construction-wise. We help them out, you</br>   know? Lend them a hand, give them the tools to have their own company, to</br>   have what they had over there, and not make them feel restrained, or not</br>   make them feel that they're not part of the country when we're in the same</br>   boat.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I think we have to work on that. We have to work on having work</br>   opportunities not only in call centers. There's a lot of people who are too</br>   good to be in a call center, but that's all they can find because maybe</br>   they don't have a college degree, but they have experience. And I can tell</br>   you, and it still happens to me, when people... When I'm working, I do have</br>   to speak English sometimes, but when I'm in meetings with clients and</br>   things like that, it's just Spanish. And when they hear that I speak</br>   English or they talk about the States or something and I say that was there</br>   and things like that, and they ask me why I'm here, and just telling them,</br>   &quot;Oh, well, I came back because I wanted to.&quot; And then, them looking at me</br>   weird, like, &quot;Why would you come back if you were over there?&quot; Or when they</br>   ask, &quot;Did you have to come back because you were illegal?&quot; Dude, well,</br>   yeah, I came back because I couldn't stay over there, but you don't have to</br>   treat me differently.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: And the type of people that I meet are people who have visas, who go</br>   back and forth, and they don't understand; &quot;Well, why don't you get a visa?</br>   Why did you leave without a visa?&quot; “No...” And I think changing that</br>   mindset, too, from the people that are here— the people that were born here</br>   and everything—there must be a way to make them understand that we're still</br>   Mexican. It wasn't our decision most of the time, why we had to leave. You</br>   know?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I mean, I've been here for eight years, and it still happens</br>   sometimes. People just look at me weird because I came back. And I think</br>   the government has to have this type of organizations like New Comienzos so</br>   people can relate, so people can get out there. New Comienzos is amazing</br>   and everything, but a lot of people build their own community, and they're</br>   just together and not meeting other people out there. Maybe having a</br>   workshop or a hiring fair or exhibition for people that come back to find</br>   companies who need bilingual people specialized in certain areas. I think</br>   that would help, too. Just giving them more opportunities, I think, would</br>   be perfect.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And kind of along that same line, it's, what can the United States</br>   government do to help Mexican deportees and the family that they leave</br>   behind? What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, for one thing, a lot of people that are deported don't even</br>   have a criminal record. They don't have no background or anything that</br>   says, &quot;Oh, you're a bad person, and you can't be here.&quot; Maybe just really</br>   giving them a chance to—especially when you deport the dad, or the mom, and</br>   they leave their family behind. Like, why would you separate families? I</br>   mean, that's not even humanly fair. It's so unfair. It's so, so unfair.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I understand their ground, I understand that “Why would they be</br>   invaded by Mexicans?” But they also have to understand the situations here.</br>   Maybe work along, like I said, fix a problem from the root. I don't know.</br>   Both governments have to sit down and talk about this. Like right now, the</br>   importing tariff that was imposed of five percent on all the Mexican</br>   products being exported to the U.S. unless we stop the people crossing</br>   over. But if we had more opportunities and the governments both worked</br>   together to make the economy grow here and have more chances for them not</br>   to even think about leaving, it would change a lot. So, we have to analyze</br>   why people are leaving, and try to fix that problem. And they should work</br>   together. It sounds so easy, right? But it's so complicated. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah! I guess those are really all the questions that I had</br>   specifically, but I want to give you the chance now to say anything else</br>   that you think you may not have said, or anything else that you might want</br>   to add, if you want to.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: Well, I just want to say thank you to you and everyone who's here to</br>   try to gather information to try and do something about the situation. I</br>   think that's so amazing, and I just... I don't know what we have to do.</br>   People who come back, or people who are thinking about coming back because</br>   they're not comfortable in the States, should be able to do it without a</br>   problem and feel safe that they are welcome here with open arms. And that</br>   they see that there's opportunities outside of the US, and that we can</br>   build a better economy here if a lot of people were still here, or people</br>   went to college.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I met this one guy who studied, well, he went to college in Texas,</br>   and he's working here for an HR company, but now he's going to work for</br>   Uber in Mexico. And I asked him, I'm like, &quot;Okay, you're from over</br>   there...&quot; He's Mexican, but he came back to work here. And he's like,</br>   &quot;Because I make dollars here. I spend in pesos. And it's a lot cheaper. I</br>   already bought my own apartment, I have my own car, I have all this,&quot; and</br>   it's like, yeah, we can do it here, you know? It's not impossible. I'm so</br>   grateful. My commissions are in dollars, and I spent pesos, too, so it's</br>   different.</br> </br> </br>   Ilse: I think we have such amazing people, and a lot of workforce. We just</br>   need to be given that little support so we can do amazing things, and I</br>   just think that people should be able to be free, mainly. Be free wherever</br>   they are, and that's something that a lot of people who are undocumented in</br>   the States can't do. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Thank you so much for</br>   your time.</br> </div><\p></p>
