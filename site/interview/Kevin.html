   but a bit about what motivated your family to migrate to the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: I'm not sure. I just know economic-wis</span>e.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you grow up knowing that you were undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I grew up knowing I was illegal.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you remember when your parents told you or how you found out?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: They told me when I was like 12, just because I was in trouble with</br>   the law.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. Before that time, can you tell me a bit about your childhood,</br>   going to school, what kind of friends you had?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: When I was seven, my stepdad got locked up. I remember that. He got</br>   locked up for trafficking drugs. He did some time. Me and my mama had to go</br>   somewhere.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where was this? Where were you living?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: In the States, Indiana.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Indiana.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: He got deported for 10 years also. After that I grew up, went to</br>   school. Time passed by, then I…</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was school like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It's all right. Boring. [crosstalk 00:01:11].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Boring?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I didn't like school at all really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends at school?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I've always had a lot of friends.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How did you, like what did do you do for fun? What [inaudible</br>   00:01:20] did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: When I was young, I used to like playing football a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Soccer or American football?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Both.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Both?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: But really American football more.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. Just for fun or on a team?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Fun really. It was just street football.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, yeah. Nice. Could you tell me a bit about… I guess you said</br>   that you had a run-in with the law when you were 12. What happened there?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Actually, I was 13.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, 13.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was being bad. Really, I was being bad. I was with some friends, we</br>   got into some things. Got locked up, and I did some time, came out. And</br>   then from when I was 13, that's when everything started. I started going in</br>   and out, doing time, till I hit 18.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Could you tell me a bit about, I guess, more details in there, like</br>   what happened? What do you think caused that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Money. When I was 13 I liked money a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, the streets called us a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What did you like to buy?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Not even really buy, just... How can I say it? I'm going to just say</br>   how it is. We used to be young, crazy. When I was 13, I caught my first</br>   burglary. We broke into a house, stole a lot of things. We got caught for</br>   it. After that, since we got placed on probation, that's when it all</br>   started. I like smoking weed. I'm really a weed person. I don't mess with</br>   anything else; just weed.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's starting to be legalized in the U.S. too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It has to be legalized. It has to. Everywhere. Even here. Even here.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you say that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It's kind of dumb not to have weed legalized. Everybody smokes weed.</br>   Everybody growing weed. Anywhere you go, you see weed. Honestly, it's</br>   better. I think weed being legal makes a lot of things better.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I think so. And it gets a lot more people connected. From my</br>   experience, if you got some good weed, you're going to get a lot of good</br>   customers. That's real, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Is that how you formed a community with your friends, just like</br>   smoking and hanging out?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, that's what we really did: smoke, hang out. I've never really</br>   been a... Well, I was a troublemaker. But once I got deported, everything</br>   changed. I really just started relaxing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me about the events that led to your deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah. I got locked up for selling drugs, a gun-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was it just weed or other drugs as well?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Let me remember at that time. No, at the time it was weed and coke.</br>   It was weed and coke and a handgun. I got arrested for that. I actually</br>   went to trial. I won my case, but you know after that, immigration, once</br>   they get ahold of you, you got to go with them.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, they gave me a court date with them. But during that, I had to be</br>   transferred from one jail to another jail, from a state jail to an</br>   immigration jail. During that process, I asked the officer, I was like,</br>   &quot;What's my situation look like?&quot; Well, he told me straight up, he was like,</br>   &quot;You're deported. Your case, you got...&quot; So, I was like, &quot;All right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: During the process, I knew where we were going to. I know where I</br>   live. I know my area. You know when somebody knows where they live?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, yeah. It's your hometown.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, I was like, &quot;Man. We've got an hour to get there. I got an hour</br>   to get away. Somebody is going to lose this one.&quot; So, during that process,</br>   I actually was able to take my handcuffs off.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How'd you do that? Just removed them?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I pulled them out. I pulled them out. He didn't put them on</br>   that tight. So, I pulled them out, I got loose. After that, we had a</br>   minivan. I still remember today. It's a minivan, the middle seats are not</br>   even there. I'm in the back seat. As soon as we get to where I was knowing</br>   we was going to get to, I said, &quot;All right. We finna get off the freeway.</br>   It's a stop light. If that light turns red, I'm gone.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was 19, going on 20.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was it like an adrenaline? Were you nervous? What was it like in</br>   that moment?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My mind was just like, &quot;Fuck it. It's my life or his life. It's going</br>   to be my life. He ain't going to...&quot; I looked at it like just, &quot;What? Just</br>   because he says and somebody higher than him says just because I'm illegal</br>   they're going to deport me? You're fucking with the wrong one. You're going</br>   to have to catch me.&quot; That's the way I looked at it. “You're fucking with</br>   the wrong one.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, then the light turned red, and what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: As soon as we got there, the light was actually turning yellow. I was</br>   like, &quot;Man, it's now or never.&quot; So, I just went ahead and got up. First</br>   thing I did was punch the window. It cracked. After that, he turned around.</br>   He was on the phone. I still remember the whole action. He was on the</br>   phone, dropped the phone. He was trying to put the car in park. He was</br>   trying to take his belt off. He was also trying to grab his gun and grab</br>   the cell phone at the same time, but it was just too much. So I just went</br>   ahead. And as soon as I punched the window, it came in my mind. I was like,</br>   &quot;What am I doing?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Man, I just made this worse.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;I might as well just complete with it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Like the damage is done, you think?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If I did it, I might as well just do it. Because either way, if I</br>   don't do it, they're going to hit me with attempt to escape. It's like, &quot;I</br>   might as well just go all the way out. I already did it.&quot; So, I just</br>   punched the window again, and my whole body went through it. I just fell,</br>   hit the floor, got up, hit the freeway, jumped a couple fences, hid through</br>   a alley, and I was gone. I was gone.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: They didn't find me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: They didn't find me. It took them four days to find me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where were you? Where were you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just back and forth, back and forth.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have contact with your family at all? Did you have your kid</br>   at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My baby mama was pregnant at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. But your kid wasn't born yet?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No, he wasn't born yet. I had contact with my people a little bit. I</br>   actually had to call my mom because I had some money that I needed to get</br>   to leave the States, because I knew the case. My case went from a state</br>   case to a federal case. They actually started wiring my mom's phone. They</br>   actually had a car outside my mom. Every time she went to work, they</br>   followed her. So, I knew my case. I made it worse. So, I was like, &quot;I got</br>   to get out the state.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you regret doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yes and no. Yes, because I lost a lot of opportunities. It could have</br>   been better for me. And then no, because I went all the way out. I went all</br>   the way out. Immigration knows. I know if I were to go back out there,</br>   they're going to be like, &quot;Yeah, that's-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, they know you.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: &quot;That's that motherfucker right there.&quot; And after that I did what?</br>   They caught me after four days later. I actually stayed hiding for a couple</br>   of days between houses there and then. They would follow my mama's son at</br>   the time. They would follow my mom everywhere. Actually, every time I had</br>   somebody do something for me, I would be following them while the FBI was</br>   following them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh my goodness.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It was two occasions when I see them stop my baby mama in her car and</br>   somebody else because I had them go pick up money and clothes. As they</br>   would stop them at a gas station, I'd be across the street watching the</br>   whole scene.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's so annoying. Were you entertained by this, or was it nerve</br>   wracking?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Both. I was entertained, and I was kind of nervous. I was nervous</br>   because I was like, &quot;Man, if I know I get caught right now, it's the</br>   wraps.&quot; And then at the same time, I was thinking, &quot;Oh, they're so stupid.</br>   They think they know it all, but they don't.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, so kind of mix.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, it was a mix, really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Then you were detained for... You were how old, I guess, in this</br>   case? For two years, you said?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah. I did actually two years trying to fight my case, trying to</br>   stay legal.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were the conditions for-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Because, actually, I escaped, right?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, after four days after I got caught, they took me to jail. I</br>   actually did eight months with federal. I did federal time first. Then the</br>   judge actually gave me time served since it was my first time. I was the</br>   first offender that was 19 years old in there. Even my lawyer that was</br>   there, she was like, &quot;You're my first young offender here in federal</br>   court.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were you way younger than everybody else there?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I don't know. I was just like, &quot;Damn. Don't tell me that. You're</br>   going to make me feel fucked up. Damn. I'm finna do some time.&quot; Because</br>   they told me maximum for that is eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's like-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So I was like, &quot;Damn. Eight years? Just to get deported after that.&quot;</br>   I was like, &quot;Man.&quot; I really didn't care about it. My main concern was I got</br>   a son on the way. I was like, &quot;Eight years just for some crap?” I was like,</br>   “yeah, I did mess up.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, then I just went. They gave me a time served. After that, I went</br>   to immigration. There I fought my case. This was a little different. Here I</br>   fought my case. They actually gave me bond here. This situation I only did</br>   in total a year and three months. I got out on bond. I went to my two</br>   immigration court dates. First one, they denied me. By the second one, my</br>   son was already born. So, my lawyer fought for it. He was like, &quot;His first</br>   time being a father,&quot; this and that. &quot;Give him an opportunity.&quot; They did.</br>   They gave me a bond, $8,000, so I paid it.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was out for a year, then going to a party, hanging out with the</br>   friends, I got into a fight. Things happened. Luckily, I was the only one</br>   known there at that place. It was like if we go to a party, they just know</br>   me. This person got really messed up, ended up in the hospital. Three weeks</br>   later I found out I got a warrant for my arrest. I looked up, I called my</br>   lawyer and was like, &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot; He's like, &quot;For a fight. Best</br>   thing to do is turn yourself in. You got a record of escaping.&quot; As a minor,</br>   I got two escapes. As an adult, I got one. So, I'm automatically an escapee</br>   under their eyes.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, he's like, &quot;Turn yourself in. It looks better for you. It will</br>   make it look like you're trying to get things right, trying to do right.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;All right. Just give me a minute. Let me get some money. I</br>   got to leave some money at home, got to leave some money for me too.&quot; He's</br>   like, &quot;All right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, after that, I turned myself in. I did four months with the state.</br>   They dropped some of the charges, then I did some time. Then after that,</br>   immigration came and picked me up again for violating my first bond. Then</br>   that's when I actually did two years trying to fight my case.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were those two years like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just boring, boring. Time is time. I can do time. I look at it like</br>   if you're going to do the crime, you're going to have to do the time either</br>   way. Ain't no whining or crying. That's the way I look at it, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If you really want to be out here in the streets and doing your</br>   bullshit, you're going to have to wait. You going to have to bear with the</br>   time. When I was locked up, I just really gambled. I like playing cards and</br>   gambling for money. That's how I did my two years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you ever get to see your kid? Did he come and visit?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No? Did you get to see them before you left?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My mama.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Your mom? You got to see her?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Only because she wanted to. I told her not to.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why is that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I didn't want to see nobody. For me, I knew it was going to be harder</br>   for my mom than it was going to be harder for me, so I didn't want to see</br>   my mama cry. Because at the end of the day, it was going to make me hurt.</br>   So I was like, &quot;I'd rather just not see you. I haven't seen you in so many</br>   years already. To not see you before I leave to another state, I would</br>   prefer that.&quot; And I told my mama that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: But she came anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, she came anyways. I told her, &quot;Don't come. Just leave me some</br>   money and some shit and go home.&quot; Next thing you know, I woke up, they go,</br>   &quot;You got a visit.&quot; I was like, &quot;Damn. She had to stay.&quot; And first thing she</br>   did was cry. I already knew. I was like, &quot;Ma, don't start crying, man. If</br>   you're going to visit me, don't even cry. I'm going to turn this off on you</br>   right now.&quot; And she stopped crying.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, she did?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, because I told her. I was like, &quot;I don't want to see you cry.</br>   At the end of the day, I got myself into this. What are you going to cry</br>   for?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Are you still in contact?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Actually, since I got deported, my communication with my mom,</br>   everybody, has kind of been down. We don't talk like that no more.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Before we get to that, just to go back a little bit, can you tell</br>   me about your deportation and return to Mexico a bit? I guess return in</br>   parentheses, since you kind of grew up...</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It was all right. It kind of was hard to get used to it, walking</br>   around, looking. I'm used to having my car out there, having my own things.</br>   So, having to go from a car to a train, which is a metro here, going out</br>   there, it was difficult. Food wise, I'm used to just eating anything over</br>   there and going to some quick restaurant, whatever it is, fast food.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. What do you miss the most?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Where I stayed at, we had Steak 'n Shake Rally's. I miss that so</br>   much. Out here we don't have that. The only thing I've actually had out</br>   here was IHOP, which is good. I like IHOP. But other than that, McDonald's</br>   don’t taste the same, I think. It's kind of different.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I think that's pretty common. Do you think that your adjustment</br>   was more difficult because you didn't really grow up here at all?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did it feel like you were entering just a completely new country?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what it felt like, like they just dropped me off in the</br>   jungle.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just said, &quot;Here. Just go from here. You're on your own.&quot; And mainly</br>   it's just I had no family out here. They just dropped me off and said,</br>   &quot;You're on your own.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: We walked in here, and two people were like, &quot;Hey, what's up?&quot; How</br>   did you make your community here, some friends? Do you feel like you have</br>   any, I guess? I don't want to assume anything. Do you feel like you have?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, yeah. I have. The way I am, the way I carry myself, and the way</br>   I talk. One thing my mama always told me since I was little, she was like,</br>   &quot;No matter what, tell the truth. You've got to keep it real. If you don't</br>   like somebody let them know. 'I don't like you. I ain't going to talk.' If</br>   you like somebody, let them know. 'You're all right. We can talk,</br>   whatever.' If you don't, just avoid the people.&quot; My mama always told me</br>   that. &quot;Keep it real. Number one thing: keep it real no matter what.&quot; That's</br>   what I do, and a lot of people like me for that, because no matter what or</br>   who it is, I keep it real. I done have occasions with my supervisors where</br>   I lit them up. I don't care. I go, &quot;You're just my supervisor.&quot; It's just</br>   the way it is. If I don't like the way you treat me, I'm going to let you</br>   know. I'm going to talk the way I have to talk.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where do you think… you said your mom instilled that kind of</br>   mentality or value. Do you attribute a lot of your personality and stuff to</br>   your mom? Or what do you think really shaped you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I think my mom on one hand side, and the streets. My mom and the</br>   streets.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In what way?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Because my mom was hard with me. She was never that, &quot;What you need?</br>   I got you.&quot; Or &quot;What's going on? I got you.&quot; She was like, &quot;What's going</br>   on? That's your problem. You did that. That's your problem. You need what?</br>   Go get it yourself.&quot; I had a hard mom. I love her though, but she was</br>   pretty tough on me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, tough love.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Tough love. More than my brothers, because they can ask for, &quot;Oh, I</br>   need this.&quot; &quot;Get them.&quot; I don't see why she did that, but sometimes I'd be</br>   like it might've been for a good thing because I am who I am now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And your brothers are citizens, right?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, my brothers are citizens.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, you were the oldest and you were born in Mexico before you came</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you ever talk about that together? Was there ever a dynamic or</br>   differences in what you were able to do?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Oh, yeah, I used to... With my mom?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, no. Just with you. Or with your mom too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No, I used to tell my mama like, &quot;Damn, mom. You should've got</br>   pregnant in the States. You should have had me out there. I wouldn't be out</br>   here suffering.&quot; But I like it though. I look at it like it's a life</br>   experience. Everything's an adventure in this life. As soon as I got</br>   deported, I was like, &quot;This is an adventure.&quot; They say Mexico is bad. Out</br>   here it's not bad. Out here there's just a lot of cops. You see everybody.</br>   You can get took care of. You can get robbed or whatever, the camo is out</br>   there. If you go to where I live, it's a whole-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where do you live?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Ecatepec. It's known for the worst area, and it's known for its...</br>   It's just known. Even Ubers won't go out there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I don't know anything. What's it known for?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Stealing, kidnapping, killing, drugs. Yeah, it's pretty bad.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, it sounds pretty intense.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It is. It is. A lot of people tell me I got to get up out of there,</br>   but I grew up out there in the States too in the hood, you know, and I like</br>   the hood. It's part of me. I like it. I've had women before. Women are</br>   like, &quot;I'm going to take you out.&quot; Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So that's sort of ironically your comfort zone in a way? [crosstalk</br>   00:18:22].</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I like it. I like it. Yeah, it's my comfort zone. I like it because I</br>   can be me. Because I know out here if I talk some certain way or dress some</br>   certain way or whatever some way, They're not out to judge like that.</br>   That's the number one thing out here in Mexico I don't like. They're quick</br>   to judge you. You got a tattoo, you got some type of dress, you smoke,</br>   whatever, they're quick to judge you. I don't like that. So, I prefer being</br>   in the hood because the hood knows what it's like. The hood suffers. I've</br>   been through not having no money. I done been through having to struggle,</br>   having to get some money. I know what it's like suffering, so I prefer</br>   being with the people that know what it's like to being with some other</br>   people that don't know what it's like. Because at the end of the day, they</br>   get it all. They're being able to get whatever they want whenever they</br>   want.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: And on the other side, you're not. You're having to suffer. You're</br>   having to deal with it. You actually live in reality. You're not living a</br>   dream. You're not getting things from other people. You're having to get it</br>   on your own. That's what sorted me out here as soon as I got out here,</br>   because out there in the States, if I had a problem or something, I could</br>   hit somebody up or my mom. I would just be like, &quot;Hey, let me borrow some,</br>   and I'll pay you back.&quot; Out here you're on your own.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Hm.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Since I've been out here, yeah, I lost more contact with my family,</br>   relationship's going lower than what it was back then. But the way I look</br>   at it, we're all borrowed in this life. We're just born one time. We're</br>   going to die at the end of the day. I told my mama that one time, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Mom, I'm borrowed. At the end of the day, I'm really not even yours. I was</br>   born, you take care of me 18 years, and I'm gone on my own. At the end of</br>   the day, that’s what’s going to happen. Everybody continues with their own</br>   life. At the end of the day, you're going to die some day. My life is going</br>   to continue. My brother's life is going to continue. Everybody's going life</br>   continue. Why cry? Why suffer? What's the point of it?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: We only have so much time.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Exactly. Might as well just enjoy my time. If I can have you with me,</br>   of course I'm going to enjoy the time. But if I can't, and I'm the one who</br>   did this, then I'm going to deal with it. I'm going to suffer the</br>   consequences.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Have you come to terms with it?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, continue. So, this is kind of going against what you were</br>   saying in terms of just living in the moment and just taking things as they</br>   are…</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: … but if I were to just stretch you a little bit, what would your</br>   hopes be if you were still in the U.S.? What would you like to be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If I was still in the U.S., I think I'd still have my job that I had</br>   out there, which was the cleaning, and I'd just be out there taking care of</br>   my son. That's all I was out there. When I actually got out on my bond and</br>   I had my son with me for that period of time, that's all I did. Just went</br>   to work, relaxed, came home. That's it. That's all I really done. After I</br>   had my son, I really stopped. I stopped all my bull crap. I grew up without</br>   a father, so I know what it's like. I told myself that's what they want,</br>   and I actually failed at that because I'm down here and he's down there. It</br>   hurts me sometimes, but at the end of the day, I made the decision. So, I</br>   have to deal with that. But I can tell everybody he going to grow up. He</br>   going to know the truth. He's going to know I fucked up. So if he accepts</br>   it, then we go from there. If he don't, I got to deal with the consequence.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. We ask that question partially because there's a lot of</br>   assumptions and stereotypes about who the U.S. is deporting. I think it's</br>   important to know like, &quot;What do you think you would be doing in the U.S.&quot;</br>   And like, &quot;Oh, I'd be taking care of my son. I didn't have a father growing</br>   up, and yeah, I did some stuff I regret or maybe made some mistakes in the</br>   past. But I knew what I would be doing then.&quot; There's the assumption like,</br>   &quot;Oh, well, here's his track record, and that's what he'd continue to be</br>   doing. We need to deport him.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what they really go off, the record. That's all I remember. He</br>   just looked me up. &quot;His record is this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: They don't look at the person.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what I used to fight. That's why I actually stayed two years,</br>   because I was trying to fight them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you believed in yourself.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I was like, &quot;I messed up at that first time. Yeah, I escaped. I</br>   did my case were bigger than what it was supposed to be. You caught me. I'm</br>   not going to lie. You caught me. And if you did it-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You were still pretty smart about it though.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, yeah. I was like, &quot;If you didn't catch me, I'd still be there</br>   right now. But no, things worked out for a reason. You caught me for a</br>   reason.&quot; Everything happened for a reason. And like I told the judge before</br>   they deported me, I was like, &quot;Look, Your Honor, I turned myself in. I got</br>   the record of not turning myself in. I actually got a record of escaping,</br>   running from the law during transportation, during whatever the situation</br>   is. But that's my record, running.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: And I told him just like that. &quot;I'm actually trying to change. I got</br>   a son that was just born. He's not that many months old. It's something</br>   big, you know something big for me.&quot; But all I remember is actually him</br>   asking my baby mama, &quot;Does he got insurance?&quot; She was like, &quot;Yeah. Anything</br>   would happen to him, insurance will cover him. He don't need his dad.&quot; So I</br>   just stood quiet. I was just like, &quot;All right.&quot; My judge, my lawyer was</br>   like, &quot;Anything else?&quot; I just told him... I really went off. I just told</br>   the judge, I was like, &quot;Think what you want. Feel how you want. But at the</br>   end of the day, somehow, some way, I'm a gonna to come back. You can take</br>   me away from my mom, anybody, but not my son. At the end of the day, I'm a</br>   gonna to come back. You're a judge. You've just got a black thing on. You</br>   ain't nobody to tell me shit. You ain't nobody. This courtroom ain't</br>   nobody. These handcuffs ain't nobody.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say this?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I said that during courtroom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow. You really did tell them. You're really honest. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I told him. My lawyer kept telling me to be quiet, and I told</br>   my lawyer, &quot;No. Fuck that. You know, They're going-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's already been [crosstalk 00:24:00].</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I'm already deported. What else are they going to do? Keep me</br>   here another month? I don't think they're going to want that. They want me</br>   out of here. So, I just let the judge know how I felt. I told him, &quot;Either</br>   way, somehow I'm going to come back, legal or illegal.&quot; At the end of the</br>   day, you're not going to stop no Mexican from coming over. No one will.</br>   Never.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: The president's learning that the hard way, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: The way I look at it, and I told him, I'm like, &quot;I actually feel like</br>   we're better than you mentality wise, because you're building walls. You're</br>   building anything, underground, whatever, and we're still coming over.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Still coming over. Somehow, some way, we're still coming over. Either</br>   it's 10 people, or there's five people. It's either one, or it's 20. But</br>   we're coming over, and you're not going to stop it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm sure he loved to hear that.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I'd love to pass out to Trump too.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Well, we're trying to create a platform for you to be able to have</br>   a voice as well. To flip that question to now that you are in Mexico, what</br>   do want to do? Do you have any hopes? I know you said you want to go back</br>   to the U.S. Is that the goal, or what it is for right now?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I don't know really. I have been through so much in life. I just look</br>   at it as just whatever's going to happen is going to happen now. You can</br>   plan something for now, but shit changes. Sometimes things go from good to</br>   bad. Some things bad from good. You can't really tell life. It's destiny. I</br>   just made it to my mind where we're going to take it day by day. Whatever</br>   happens, happens. If I make it back, I would be so excited. If I don't, I</br>   don't. But at the end of the day, I look at it like either way, if I'm</br>   going to be here... I got deported 10 years. I've been here two. So, if I'm</br>   going to be here for 10 years, trying to be good and try to go back, I at</br>   least got to have some type of a life. I'm going to date somebody if I'm</br>   going to have more kids or whatever. But at the end of the day, I have that</br>   right to live my life. So, I just live it day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Day by day. Because at the end of the day, I could end up getting a</br>   girl out here or meeting a girl out here that will change my mentality. And</br>   it'll be like, &quot;You know what? I actually like it.&quot; Things happen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Who knows?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Things happen. I just look at it like that. Things happen. Or I could</br>   get the opportunity to go back, or I could die. It's just life. I just look</br>   at it day by day. Whatever happens is going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: A lot of people we talk to, I think, understandably so, feel kind</br>   of frozen in time. They think like their life is continuing in the U.S.</br>   without them, and that can be really difficult to reconcile with being in</br>   Mexico too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I had it like that. My first year I had it like that. I would look at</br>   the time, and I'd be like, &quot;Down there it's this time.&quot; I would live off</br>   that time instead of living off this time. Every day I'd be like, &quot;If I was</br>   down there, I'd be doing this. If I was eating right now, I'd be eating</br>   this.&quot; My mind wouldn't be here. My body would be here, but my mind</br>   wouldn't be over... Till it just clicked in. I was like, &quot;Man, you're</br>   screwed, dude. You're not going nowhere. Just get that shit out your mind</br>   and let’s face reality.&quot; That's what I'm doing: facing reality.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I think that takes a lot of willpower though.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It does, but what other option do we have? A lot of people would</br>   rather just live off a dream or live off something else instead of facing</br>   reality and looking at it like you know, this is life. I have no other</br>   option. This is what I got to deal with. Some other people would rather</br>   just give themselves a visuality or a dream that ah, things will get better</br>   or this or that. I look at it no, life is life. If it gets better, it gets</br>   better. If it don't, it don't. But at the end of the way, you're living</br>   life. At the end of the day, this is one life we have. Why waste it? It's</br>   one time. We ain't gonna to live this life again. Why waste it? I had my</br>   fun in the States. I won't lie. I did everything I wanted to. Once I got</br>   deported, I just, you know, all I do here is work. I smoke weed. I like</br>   weed. I don't lie.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="ffcb67b1-5248-4c7e-b4bd-0f93f5938466" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Drugs,  weed, Mental Health">Isabel: Do you think weed is just something to relax here and have fun, or<br>
   do you think it gives you a break from where you are?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: Yeah, it can do both, depending also on the person. Every person's<br>
   body is different. Every person takes it different. Me, I actually take it<br>
   to relax me. Sometimes I actually just take it just to have fun, relax and<br>
   chill, depending on the moment. There are days I work when I get so<br>
   frustrated I just need to smoke to just relax my mind where I'm just like,<br>
   &quot;All right, I'm cool.&quot; Because it brings me to where, &quot;Fuck it. It was just<br>
   a phone call. It was his job. Fuck ‘em. It is what it is.&quot; And then when<br>
   I'm with friends, we're just like, &quot;Oh yeah, let's smoke. Just laughs.&quot;<br>
   Right there it's just haha, giggles, laughs, you're just clowning on<br>
   people.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Everything's funny.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: Yeah, everything's funny. You're just roasting. And I'm one of those.<br>
   I get to roasting everybody. I just like to have fun. So, yeah. sometimes I<br>
   do use weed to get my depression out.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: Sometimes it comes around when you get depressed being out here on<br>
   your own. But like I said, I just smoke. When I smoke, it goes away. My<br>
   mentality switches to, &quot;Look, you're on your own. Why suffer? Why cry?&quot; My<br>
   mentality just switches quick, and I stop being depressed about it. It is<br>
   what it is.</span><span id="f73907cf-bce3-4c53-8d62-8e79b8fc2211" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Family">I have been through so much in life. I just look<br>

   going to school, what kind of friends you had?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: When I was seven, my stepdad got locked up. I remember that. He got<br>
   locked up for trafficking drugs. He did some time. Me and my mama had to go<br>
   somewhere.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Isabel: Where was this? Where were you living?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: In the States, Indiana.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Indiana.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: He got deported for 10 years also. After that I grew up, went to</br>   school. Time passed by, then I…</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was school like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It's all right. Boring. [crosstalk 00:01:11].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Boring?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I didn't like school at all really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends at school?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I've always had a lot of friends.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How did you, like what did do you do for fun? What [inaudible</br>   00:01:20] did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: When I was young, I used to like playing football a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Soccer or American football?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Both.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Both?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: But really American football more.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. Just for fun or on a team?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Fun really. It was just street football.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, yeah. Nice. Could you tell me a bit about… I guess you said</br>   that you had a run-in with the law when you were 12. What happened there?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Actually, I was 13.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, 13.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was being bad. Really, I was being bad. I was with some friends, we</br>   got into some things. Got locked up, and I did some time, came out. And</br>   then from when I was 13, that's when everything started. I started going in</br>   and out, doing time, till I hit 18.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Could you tell me a bit about, I guess, more details in there, like</br>   what happened? What do you think caused that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Money. When I was 13 I liked money a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, the streets called us a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What did you like to buy?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Not even really buy, just... How can I say it? I'm going to just say</br>   how it is. We used to be young, crazy. When I was 13, I caught my first</br>   burglary. We broke into a house, stole a lot of things. We got caught for</br>   it. After that, since we got placed on probation, that's when it all</br>   started. I like smoking weed. I'm really a weed person. I don't mess with</br>   anything else; just weed.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's starting to be legalized in the U.S. too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It has to be legalized. It has to. Everywhere. Even here. Even here.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you say that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It's kind of dumb not to have weed legalized. Everybody smokes weed.</br>   Everybody growing weed. Anywhere you go, you see weed. Honestly, it's</br>   better. I think weed being legal makes a lot of things better.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I think so. And it gets a lot more people connected. From my</br>   experience, if you got some good weed, you're going to get a lot of good</br>   customers. That's real, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Is that how you formed a community with your friends, just like</br>   smoking and hanging out?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, that's what we really did: smoke, hang out. I've never really</br>   been a... Well, I was a troublemaker. But once I got deported, everything</br>   changed. I really just started relaxing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me about the events that led to your deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah. I got locked up for selling drugs, a gun-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was it just weed or other drugs as well?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Let me remember at that time. No, at the time it was weed and coke.</br>   It was weed and coke and a handgun. I got arrested for that. I actually</br>   went to trial. I won my case, but you know after that, immigration, once</br>   they get ahold of you, you got to go with them.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, they gave me a court date with them. But during that, I had to be</br>   transferred from one jail to another jail, from a state jail to an</br>   immigration jail. During that process, I asked the officer, I was like,</br>   &quot;What's my situation look like?&quot; Well, he told me straight up, he was like,</br>   &quot;You're deported. Your case, you got...&quot; So, I was like, &quot;All right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: During the process, I knew where we were going to. I know where I</br>   live. I know my area. You know when somebody knows where they live?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, yeah. It's your hometown.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, I was like, &quot;Man. We've got an hour to get there. I got an hour</br>   to get away. Somebody is going to lose this one.&quot; So, during that process,</br>   I actually was able to take my handcuffs off.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How'd you do that? Just removed them?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I pulled them out. I pulled them out. He didn't put them on</br>   that tight. So, I pulled them out, I got loose. After that, we had a</br>   minivan. I still remember today. It's a minivan, the middle seats are not</br>   even there. I'm in the back seat. As soon as we get to where I was knowing</br>   we was going to get to, I said, &quot;All right. We finna get off the freeway.</br>   It's a stop light. If that light turns red, I'm gone.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was 19, going on 20.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was it like an adrenaline? Were you nervous? What was it like in</br>   that moment?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My mind was just like, &quot;Fuck it. It's my life or his life. It's going</br>   to be my life. He ain't going to...&quot; I looked at it like just, &quot;What? Just</br>   because he says and somebody higher than him says just because I'm illegal</br>   they're going to deport me? You're fucking with the wrong one. You're going</br>   to have to catch me.&quot; That's the way I looked at it. “You're fucking with</br>   the wrong one.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, then the light turned red, and what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: As soon as we got there, the light was actually turning yellow. I was</br>   like, &quot;Man, it's now or never.&quot; So, I just went ahead and got up. First</br>   thing I did was punch the window. It cracked. After that, he turned around.</br>   He was on the phone. I still remember the whole action. He was on the</br>   phone, dropped the phone. He was trying to put the car in park. He was</br>   trying to take his belt off. He was also trying to grab his gun and grab</br>   the cell phone at the same time, but it was just too much. So I just went</br>   ahead. And as soon as I punched the window, it came in my mind. I was like,</br>   &quot;What am I doing?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Man, I just made this worse.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;I might as well just complete with it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Like the damage is done, you think?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If I did it, I might as well just do it. Because either way, if I</br>   don't do it, they're going to hit me with attempt to escape. It's like, &quot;I</br>   might as well just go all the way out. I already did it.&quot; So, I just</br>   punched the window again, and my whole body went through it. I just fell,</br>   hit the floor, got up, hit the freeway, jumped a couple fences, hid through</br>   a alley, and I was gone. I was gone.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: They didn't find me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: They didn't find me. It took them four days to find me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where were you? Where were you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just back and forth, back and forth.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have contact with your family at all? Did you have your kid</br>   at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My baby mama was pregnant at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. But your kid wasn't born yet?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No, he wasn't born yet. I had contact with my people a little bit. I</br>   actually had to call my mom because I had some money that I needed to get</br>   to leave the States, because I knew the case. My case went from a state</br>   case to a federal case. They actually started wiring my mom's phone. They</br>   actually had a car outside my mom. Every time she went to work, they</br>   followed her. So, I knew my case. I made it worse. So, I was like, &quot;I got</br>   to get out the state.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you regret doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yes and no. Yes, because I lost a lot of opportunities. It could have</br>   been better for me. And then no, because I went all the way out. I went all</br>   the way out. Immigration knows. I know if I were to go back out there,</br>   they're going to be like, &quot;Yeah, that's-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, they know you.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: &quot;That's that motherfucker right there.&quot; And after that I did what?</br>   They caught me after four days later. I actually stayed hiding for a couple</br>   of days between houses there and then. They would follow my mama's son at</br>   the time. They would follow my mom everywhere. Actually, every time I had</br>   somebody do something for me, I would be following them while the FBI was</br>   following them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh my goodness.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It was two occasions when I see them stop my baby mama in her car and</br>   somebody else because I had them go pick up money and clothes. As they</br>   would stop them at a gas station, I'd be across the street watching the</br>   whole scene.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's so annoying. Were you entertained by this, or was it nerve</br>   wracking?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Both. I was entertained, and I was kind of nervous. I was nervous</br>   because I was like, &quot;Man, if I know I get caught right now, it's the</br>   wraps.&quot; And then at the same time, I was thinking, &quot;Oh, they're so stupid.</br>   They think they know it all, but they don't.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, so kind of mix.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, it was a mix, really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Then you were detained for... You were how old, I guess, in this</br>   case? For two years, you said?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah. I did actually two years trying to fight my case, trying to</br>   stay legal.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were the conditions for-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Because, actually, I escaped, right?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, after four days after I got caught, they took me to jail. I</br>   actually did eight months with federal. I did federal time first. Then the</br>   judge actually gave me time served since it was my first time. I was the</br>   first offender that was 19 years old in there. Even my lawyer that was</br>   there, she was like, &quot;You're my first young offender here in federal</br>   court.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were you way younger than everybody else there?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I don't know. I was just like, &quot;Damn. Don't tell me that. You're</br>   going to make me feel fucked up. Damn. I'm finna do some time.&quot; Because</br>   they told me maximum for that is eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's like-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So I was like, &quot;Damn. Eight years? Just to get deported after that.&quot;</br>   I was like, &quot;Man.&quot; I really didn't care about it. My main concern was I got</br>   a son on the way. I was like, &quot;Eight years just for some crap?” I was like,</br>   “yeah, I did mess up.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, then I just went. They gave me a time served. After that, I went</br>   to immigration. There I fought my case. This was a little different. Here I</br>   fought my case. They actually gave me bond here. This situation I only did</br>   in total a year and three months. I got out on bond. I went to my two</br>   immigration court dates. First one, they denied me. By the second one, my</br>   son was already born. So, my lawyer fought for it. He was like, &quot;His first</br>   time being a father,&quot; this and that. &quot;Give him an opportunity.&quot; They did.</br>   They gave me a bond, $8,000, so I paid it.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was out for a year, then going to a party, hanging out with the</br>   friends, I got into a fight. Things happened. Luckily, I was the only one</br>   known there at that place. It was like if we go to a party, they just know</br>   me. This person got really messed up, ended up in the hospital. Three weeks</br>   later I found out I got a warrant for my arrest. I looked up, I called my</br>   lawyer and was like, &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot; He's like, &quot;For a fight. Best</br>   thing to do is turn yourself in. You got a record of escaping.&quot; As a minor,</br>   I got two escapes. As an adult, I got one. So, I'm automatically an escapee</br>   under their eyes.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, he's like, &quot;Turn yourself in. It looks better for you. It will</br>   make it look like you're trying to get things right, trying to do right.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;All right. Just give me a minute. Let me get some money. I</br>   got to leave some money at home, got to leave some money for me too.&quot; He's</br>   like, &quot;All right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, after that, I turned myself in. I did four months with the state.</br>   They dropped some of the charges, then I did some time. Then after that,</br>   immigration came and picked me up again for violating my first bond. Then</br>   that's when I actually did two years trying to fight my case.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were those two years like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just boring, boring. Time is time. I can do time. I look at it like</br>   if you're going to do the crime, you're going to have to do the time either</br>   way. Ain't no whining or crying. That's the way I look at it, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If you really want to be out here in the streets and doing your</br>   bullshit, you're going to have to wait. You going to have to bear with the</br>   time. When I was locked up, I just really gambled. I like playing cards and</br>   gambling for money. That's how I did my two years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you ever get to see your kid? Did he come and visit?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No? Did you get to see them before you left?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My mama.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Your mom? You got to see her?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Only because she wanted to. I told her not to.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why is that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I didn't want to see nobody. For me, I knew it was going to be harder</br>   for my mom than it was going to be harder for me, so I didn't want to see</br>   my mama cry. Because at the end of the day, it was going to make me hurt.</br>   So I was like, &quot;I'd rather just not see you. I haven't seen you in so many</br>   years already. To not see you before I leave to another state, I would</br>   prefer that.&quot; And I told my mama that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: But she came anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, she came anyways. I told her, &quot;Don't come. Just leave me some</br>   money and some shit and go home.&quot; Next thing you know, I woke up, they go,</br>   &quot;You got a visit.&quot; I was like, &quot;Damn. She had to stay.&quot; And first thing she</br>   did was cry. I already knew. I was like, &quot;Ma, don't start crying, man. If</br>   you're going to visit me, don't even cry. I'm going to turn this off on you</br>   right now.&quot; And she stopped crying.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, she did?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, because I told her. I was like, &quot;I don't want to see you cry.</br>   At the end of the day, I got myself into this. What are you going to cry</br>   for?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Are you still in contact?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Actually, since I got deported, my communication with my mom,</br>   everybody, has kind of been down. We don't talk like that no more.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Before we get to that, just to go back a little bit, can you tell</br>   me about your deportation and return to Mexico a bit? I guess return in</br>   parentheses, since you kind of grew up...</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It was all right. It kind of was hard to get used to it, walking</br>   around, looking. I'm used to having my car out there, having my own things.</br>   So, having to go from a car to a train, which is a metro here, going out</br>   there, it was difficult. Food wise, I'm used to just eating anything over</br>   there and going to some quick restaurant, whatever it is, fast food.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. What do you miss the most?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Where I stayed at, we had Steak 'n Shake Rally's. I miss that so</br>   much. Out here we don't have that. The only thing I've actually had out</br>   here was IHOP, which is good. I like IHOP. But other than that, McDonald's</br>   don’t taste the same, I think. It's kind of different.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I think that's pretty common. Do you think that your adjustment</br>   was more difficult because you didn't really grow up here at all?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did it feel like you were entering just a completely new country?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what it felt like, like they just dropped me off in the</br>   jungle.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just said, &quot;Here. Just go from here. You're on your own.&quot; And mainly</br>   it's just I had no family out here. They just dropped me off and said,</br>   &quot;You're on your own.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: We walked in here, and two people were like, &quot;Hey, what's up?&quot; How</br>   did you make your community here, some friends? Do you feel like you have</br>   any, I guess? I don't want to assume anything. Do you feel like you have?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, yeah. I have. The way I am, the way I carry myself, and the way</br>   I talk. One thing my mama always told me since I was little, she was like,</br>   &quot;No matter what, tell the truth. You've got to keep it real. If you don't</br>   like somebody let them know. 'I don't like you. I ain't going to talk.' If</br>   you like somebody, let them know. 'You're all right. We can talk,</br>   whatever.' If you don't, just avoid the people.&quot; My mama always told me</br>   that. &quot;Keep it real. Number one thing: keep it real no matter what.&quot; That's</br>   what I do, and a lot of people like me for that, because no matter what or</br>   who it is, I keep it real. I done have occasions with my supervisors where</br>   I lit them up. I don't care. I go, &quot;You're just my supervisor.&quot; It's just</br>   the way it is. If I don't like the way you treat me, I'm going to let you</br>   know. I'm going to talk the way I have to talk.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where do you think… you said your mom instilled that kind of</br>   mentality or value. Do you attribute a lot of your personality and stuff to</br>   your mom? Or what do you think really shaped you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I think my mom on one hand side, and the streets. My mom and the</br>   streets.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In what way?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Because my mom was hard with me. She was never that, &quot;What you need?</br>   I got you.&quot; Or &quot;What's going on? I got you.&quot; She was like, &quot;What's going</br>   on? That's your problem. You did that. That's your problem. You need what?</br>   Go get it yourself.&quot; I had a hard mom. I love her though, but she was</br>   pretty tough on me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, tough love.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Tough love. More than my brothers, because they can ask for, &quot;Oh, I</br>   need this.&quot; &quot;Get them.&quot; I don't see why she did that, but sometimes I'd be</br>   like it might've been for a good thing because I am who I am now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And your brothers are citizens, right?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, my brothers are citizens.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, you were the oldest and you were born in Mexico before you came</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you ever talk about that together? Was there ever a dynamic or</br>   differences in what you were able to do?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Oh, yeah, I used to... With my mom?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, no. Just with you. Or with your mom too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No, I used to tell my mama like, &quot;Damn, mom. You should've got</br>   pregnant in the States. You should have had me out there. I wouldn't be out</br>   here suffering.&quot; But I like it though. I look at it like it's a life</br>   experience. Everything's an adventure in this life. As soon as I got</br>   deported, I was like, &quot;This is an adventure.&quot; They say Mexico is bad. Out</br>   here it's not bad. Out here there's just a lot of cops. You see everybody.</br>   You can get took care of. You can get robbed or whatever, the camo is out</br>   there. If you go to where I live, it's a whole-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where do you live?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Ecatepec. It's known for the worst area, and it's known for its...</br>   It's just known. Even Ubers won't go out there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I don't know anything. What's it known for?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Stealing, kidnapping, killing, drugs. Yeah, it's pretty bad.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, it sounds pretty intense.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It is. It is. A lot of people tell me I got to get up out of there,</br>   but I grew up out there in the States too in the hood, you know, and I like</br>   the hood. It's part of me. I like it. I've had women before. Women are</br>   like, &quot;I'm going to take you out.&quot; Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So that's sort of ironically your comfort zone in a way? [crosstalk</br>   00:18:22].</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I like it. I like it. Yeah, it's my comfort zone. I like it because I</br>   can be me. Because I know out here if I talk some certain way or dress some</br>   certain way or whatever some way, They're not out to judge like that.</br>   That's the number one thing out here in Mexico I don't like. They're quick</br>   to judge you. You got a tattoo, you got some type of dress, you smoke,</br>   whatever, they're quick to judge you. I don't like that. So, I prefer being</br>   in the hood because the hood knows what it's like. The hood suffers. I've</br>   been through not having no money. I done been through having to struggle,</br>   having to get some money. I know what it's like suffering, so I prefer</br>   being with the people that know what it's like to being with some other</br>   people that don't know what it's like. Because at the end of the day, they</br>   get it all. They're being able to get whatever they want whenever they</br>   want.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: And on the other side, you're not. You're having to suffer. You're</br>   having to deal with it. You actually live in reality. You're not living a</br>   dream. You're not getting things from other people. You're having to get it</br>   on your own. That's what sorted me out here as soon as I got out here,</br>   because out there in the States, if I had a problem or something, I could</br>   hit somebody up or my mom. I would just be like, &quot;Hey, let me borrow some,</br>   and I'll pay you back.&quot; Out here you're on your own.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Hm.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Since I've been out here, yeah, I lost more contact with my family,</br>   relationship's going lower than what it was back then. But the way I look</br>   at it, we're all borrowed in this life. We're just born one time. We're</br>   going to die at the end of the day. I told my mama that one time, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Mom, I'm borrowed. At the end of the day, I'm really not even yours. I was</br>   born, you take care of me 18 years, and I'm gone on my own. At the end of</br>   the day, that’s what’s going to happen. Everybody continues with their own</br>   life. At the end of the day, you're going to die some day. My life is going</br>   to continue. My brother's life is going to continue. Everybody's going life</br>   continue. Why cry? Why suffer? What's the point of it?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: We only have so much time.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Exactly. Might as well just enjoy my time. If I can have you with me,</br>   of course I'm going to enjoy the time. But if I can't, and I'm the one who</br>   did this, then I'm going to deal with it. I'm going to suffer the</br>   consequences.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Have you come to terms with it?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, continue. So, this is kind of going against what you were</br>   saying in terms of just living in the moment and just taking things as they</br>   are…</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: … but if I were to just stretch you a little bit, what would your</br>   hopes be if you were still in the U.S.? What would you like to be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If I was still in the U.S., I think I'd still have my job that I had</br>   out there, which was the cleaning, and I'd just be out there taking care of</br>   my son. That's all I was out there. When I actually got out on my bond and</br>   I had my son with me for that period of time, that's all I did. Just went</br>   to work, relaxed, came home. That's it. That's all I really done. After I</br>   had my son, I really stopped. I stopped all my bull crap. I grew up without</br>   a father, so I know what it's like. I told myself that's what they want,</br>   and I actually failed at that because I'm down here and he's down there. It</br>   hurts me sometimes, but at the end of the day, I made the decision. So, I</br>   have to deal with that. But I can tell everybody he going to grow up. He</br>   going to know the truth. He's going to know I fucked up. So if he accepts</br>   it, then we go from there. If he don't, I got to deal with the consequence.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. We ask that question partially because there's a lot of</br>   assumptions and stereotypes about who the U.S. is deporting. I think it's</br>   important to know like, &quot;What do you think you would be doing in the U.S.&quot;</br>   And like, &quot;Oh, I'd be taking care of my son. I didn't have a father growing</br>   up, and yeah, I did some stuff I regret or maybe made some mistakes in the</br>   past. But I knew what I would be doing then.&quot; There's the assumption like,</br>   &quot;Oh, well, here's his track record, and that's what he'd continue to be</br>   doing. We need to deport him.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what they really go off, the record. That's all I remember. He</br>   just looked me up. &quot;His record is this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: They don't look at the person.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what I used to fight. That's why I actually stayed two years,</br>   because I was trying to fight them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you believed in yourself.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I was like, &quot;I messed up at that first time. Yeah, I escaped. I</br>   did my case were bigger than what it was supposed to be. You caught me. I'm</br>   not going to lie. You caught me. And if you did it-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You were still pretty smart about it though.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, yeah. I was like, &quot;If you didn't catch me, I'd still be there</br>   right now. But no, things worked out for a reason. You caught me for a</br>   reason.&quot; Everything happened for a reason. And like I told the judge before</br>   they deported me, I was like, &quot;Look, Your Honor, I turned myself in. I got</br>   the record of not turning myself in. I actually got a record of escaping,</br>   running from the law during transportation, during whatever the situation</br>   is. But that's my record, running.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: And I told him just like that. &quot;I'm actually trying to change. I got</br>   a son that was just born. He's not that many months old. It's something</br>   big, you know something big for me.&quot; But all I remember is actually him</br>   asking my baby mama, &quot;Does he got insurance?&quot; She was like, &quot;Yeah. Anything</br>   would happen to him, insurance will cover him. He don't need his dad.&quot; So I</br>   just stood quiet. I was just like, &quot;All right.&quot; My judge, my lawyer was</br>   like, &quot;Anything else?&quot; I just told him... I really went off. I just told</br>   the judge, I was like, &quot;Think what you want. Feel how you want. But at the</br>   end of the day, somehow, some way, I'm a gonna to come back. You can take</br>   me away from my mom, anybody, but not my son. At the end of the day, I'm a</br>   gonna to come back. You're a judge. You've just got a black thing on. You</br>   ain't nobody to tell me shit. You ain't nobody. This courtroom ain't</br>   nobody. These handcuffs ain't nobody.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say this?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I said that during courtroom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow. You really did tell them. You're really honest. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I told him. My lawyer kept telling me to be quiet, and I told</br>   my lawyer, &quot;No. Fuck that. You know, They're going-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's already been [crosstalk 00:24:00].</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I'm already deported. What else are they going to do? Keep me</br>   here another month? I don't think they're going to want that. They want me</br>   out of here. So, I just let the judge know how I felt. I told him, &quot;Either</br>   way, somehow I'm going to come back, legal or illegal.&quot; At the end of the</br>   day, you're not going to stop no Mexican from coming over. No one will.</br>   Never.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: The president's learning that the hard way, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: The way I look at it, and I told him, I'm like, &quot;I actually feel like</br>   we're better than you mentality wise, because you're building walls. You're</br>   building anything, underground, whatever, and we're still coming over.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Still coming over. Somehow, some way, we're still coming over. Either</br>   it's 10 people, or there's five people. It's either one, or it's 20. But</br>   we're coming over, and you're not going to stop it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm sure he loved to hear that.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I'd love to pass out to Trump too.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Well, we're trying to create a platform for you to be able to have</br>   a voice as well. To flip that question to now that you are in Mexico, what</br>   do want to do? Do you have any hopes? I know you said you want to go back</br>   to the U.S. Is that the goal, or what it is for right now?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I don't know really. I have been through so much in life. I just look</br>   at it as just whatever's going to happen is going to happen now. You can</br>   plan something for now, but shit changes. Sometimes things go from good to</br>   bad. Some things bad from good. You can't really tell life. It's destiny. I</br>   just made it to my mind where we're going to take it day by day. Whatever</br>   happens, happens. If I make it back, I would be so excited. If I don't, I</br>   don't. But at the end of the day, I look at it like either way, if I'm</br>   going to be here... I got deported 10 years. I've been here two. So, if I'm</br>   going to be here for 10 years, trying to be good and try to go back, I at</br>   least got to have some type of a life. I'm going to date somebody if I'm</br>   going to have more kids or whatever. But at the end of the day, I have that</br>   right to live my life. So, I just live it day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Day by day. Because at the end of the day, I could end up getting a</br>   girl out here or meeting a girl out here that will change my mentality. And</br>   it'll be like, &quot;You know what? I actually like it.&quot; Things happen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Who knows?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Things happen. I just look at it like that. Things happen. Or I could</br>   get the opportunity to go back, or I could die. It's just life. I just look</br>   at it day by day. Whatever happens is going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: A lot of people we talk to, I think, understandably so, feel kind</br>   of frozen in time. They think like their life is continuing in the U.S.</br>   without them, and that can be really difficult to reconcile with being in</br>   Mexico too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I had it like that. My first year I had it like that. I would look at</br>   the time, and I'd be like, &quot;Down there it's this time.&quot; I would live off</br>   that time instead of living off this time. Every day I'd be like, &quot;If I was</br>   down there, I'd be doing this. If I was eating right now, I'd be eating</br>   this.&quot; My mind wouldn't be here. My body would be here, but my mind</br>   wouldn't be over... Till it just clicked in. I was like, &quot;Man, you're</br>   screwed, dude. You're not going nowhere. Just get that shit out your mind</br>   and let’s face reality.&quot; That's what I'm doing: facing reality.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I think that takes a lot of willpower though.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It does, but what other option do we have? A lot of people would</br>   rather just live off a dream or live off something else instead of facing</br>   reality and looking at it like you know, this is life. I have no other</br>   option. This is what I got to deal with. Some other people would rather</br>   just give themselves a visuality or a dream that ah, things will get better</br>   or this or that. I look at it no, life is life. If it gets better, it gets</br>   better. If it don't, it don't. But at the end of the way, you're living</br>   life. At the end of the day, this is one life we have. Why waste it? It's</br>   one time. We ain't gonna to live this life again. Why waste it? I had my</br>   fun in the States. I won't lie. I did everything I wanted to. Once I got</br>   deported, I just, you know, all I do here is work. I smoke weed. I like</br>   weed. I don't lie.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you think weed is just something to relax here and have fun, or</br>   do you think it gives you a break from where you are?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, it can do both, depending also on the person. Every person's</br>   body is different. Every person takes it different. Me, I actually take it</br>   to relax me. Sometimes I actually just take it just to have fun, relax and</br>   chill, depending on the moment. There are days I work when I get so</br>   frustrated I just need to smoke to just relax my mind where I'm just like,</br>   &quot;All right, I'm cool.&quot; Because it brings me to where, &quot;Fuck it. It was just</br>   a phone call. It was his job. Fuck ‘em. It is what it is.&quot; And then when</br>   I'm with friends, we're just like, &quot;Oh yeah, let's smoke. Just laughs.&quot;</br>   Right there it's just haha, giggles, laughs, you're just clowning on</br>   people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Everything's funny.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, everything's funny. You're just roasting. And I'm one of those.</br>   I get to roasting everybody. I just like to have fun. So, yeah. sometimes I</br>   do use weed to get my depression out.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Sometimes it comes around when you get depressed being out here on</br>   your own. But like I said, I just smoke. When I smoke, it goes away. My</br>   mentality switches to, &quot;Look, you're on your own. Why suffer? Why cry?&quot; My</br>   mentality just switches quick, and I stop being depressed about it. It is</br>   what it is. Why?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. You said it was harder at first when you came here-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: In the beginning.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: ... and it's gotten better as you [crosstalk 00:29:42]-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I just look at it like it's-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: ... or do you think it fluctuates?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It floats, but I'm happy in my life. That's all that really matters.</br>   I'm alive. Either way, I'm good. Either way, I'm good. I don't care. I</br>   could be over there. I could be over here. I'm good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. We have some questions that we ask everyone. You can do with</br>   them what you will. <span id="83b661aa-2935-4cee-9f81-804133656e8e" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Identity, Mexican">Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?

I was like, &quot;If you didn't catch me, I'd still be there<br>
   right now. But no, things worked out for a reason. You caught me for a<br>
   reason.&quot; Everything happened for a reason. And like I told the judge before<br>
   they deported me, I was like, &quot;Look, Your Honor, I turned myself in. I got<br>
   the record of not turning myself in. I actually got a record of escaping,<br>
   running from the law during transportation, during whatever the situation<br>
   is. But that's my record, running.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: And I told him just like that. &quot;I'm actually trying to change. I got<br>
   a son that was just born. He's not that many months old. It's something<br>
   big, you know something big for me.&quot; But all I remember is actually him<br>
   asking my baby mama, &quot;Does he got insurance?&quot; She was like, &quot;Yeah. Anything<br>
   would happen to him, insurance will cover him. He don't need his dad.&quot; So I<br>
   just stood quiet. I was just like, &quot;All right.&quot; My judge, my lawyer was<br>
   like, &quot;Anything else?&quot; I just told him... I really went off. I just told<br>
   the judge, I was like, &quot;Think what you want. Feel how you want. But at the<br>
   end of the day, somehow, some way, I'm a gonna to come back. You can take<br>
   me away from my mom, anybody, but not my son. At the end of the day, I'm a<br>
   gonna to come back. You're a judge. You've just got a black thing on. You<br>

   I had my son with me for that period of time, that's all I did. Just went<br>
   to work, relaxed, came home. That's it. That's all I really done. After I<br>
   had my son, I really stopped. I stopped all my bull crap. I grew up without<br>
   a father, so I know what it's like. I told myself that's what they want,<br>
   and I actually failed at that because I'm down here and he's down there. It<br>
   hurts me sometimes, but at the end of the day, I made the decision. So, I<br>
   have to deal with that. But I can tell everybody he going to grow up. He<br>

 <br>
   Weco: It was all right. It kind of was hard to get used to it, walking<br>
   around, looking. I'm used to having my car out there, having my own things.<br>
   So, having to go from a car to a train, which is a metro here, going out<br>
   there, it was difficult. Food wise, I'm used to just eating anything over<br>
   there and going to some quick restaurant, whatever it is, fast food.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Yeah. What do you miss the most?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: Where I stayed at, we had Steak 'n Shake Rally's. I miss that so<br>
   much. Out here we don't have that. The only thing I've actually had out<br>
   here was IHOP, which is good. I like IHOP. But other than that, McDonald's<br>
   don’t taste the same, I think. It's kind of different.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: No, I think that's pretty common. Do you think that your adjustment<br>
   was more difficult because you didn't really grow up here at all?<br>

   in total a year and three months. I got out on bond. I went to my two<br>
   immigration court dates. First one, they denied me. By the second one, my<br>
   son was already born. So, my lawyer fought for it. He was like, &quot;His first<br>
   time being a father,&quot; this and that. &quot;Give him an opportunity.&quot; They did.<br>
   They gave me a bond, $8,000, so I paid it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: I was out for a year, then going to a party, hanging out with the<br>
   friends, I got into a fight. Things happened. Luckily, I was the only one<br>
   known there at that place. It was like if we go to a party, they just know<br>
   me. This person got really messed up, ended up in the hospital. Three weeks<br>
   later I found out I got a warrant for my arrest. I looked up, I called my<br>
   lawyer and was like, &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot; He's like, &quot;For a fight. Best<br>
   thing to do is turn yourself in. You got a record of escaping.&quot; As a minor,<br>
   I got two escapes. As an adult, I got one. So, I'm automatically an escapee<br>
   under their eyes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: So, he's like, &quot;Turn yourself in. It looks better for you. It will<br>
   make it look like you're trying to get things right, trying to do right.&quot;<br>
   So I was like, &quot;All right. Just give me a minute. Let me get some money. I<br>
   got to leave some money at home, got to leave some money for me too.&quot; He's<br>
   like, &quot;All right.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: So, after that, I turned myself in. I did four months with the state.<br>
   They dropped some of the charges, then I did some time. Then after that,<br>
   immigration came and picked me up again for violating my first bond. Then<br>
   that's when I actually did two years trying to fight my case.<br>

   actually did eight months with federal. I did federal time first. Then the<br>
   judge actually gave me time served since it was my first time. I was the<br>
   first offender that was 19 years old in there. Even my lawyer that was<br>
   there, she was like, &quot;You're my first young offender here in federal<br>
   court.&quot;<br>

   to get away. Somebody is going to lose this one.&quot; So, during that process,<br>
   I actually was able to take my handcuffs off.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: How'd you do that? Just removed them?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: Yeah, I pulled them out. I pulled them out. He didn't put them on<br>
   that tight. So, I pulled them out, I got loose. After that, we had a<br>
   minivan. I still remember today. It's a minivan, the middle seats are not<br>
   even there. I'm in the back seat. As soon as we get to where I was knowing<br>
   we was going to get to, I said, &quot;All right. We finna get off the freeway.<br>
   It's a stop light. If that light turns red, I'm gone.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: How old were you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: I was 19, going on 20.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Was it like an adrenaline? Were you nervous? What was it like in<br>
   that moment?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: My mind was just like, &quot;Fuck it. It's my life or his life. It's going<br>
   to be my life. He ain't going to...&quot; I looked at it like just, &quot;What? Just<br>
   because he says and somebody higher than him says just because I'm illegal<br>
   they're going to deport me? You're fucking with the wrong one. You're going<br>
   to have to catch me.&quot; That's the way I looked at it. “You're fucking with<br>
   the wrong one.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: So, then the light turned red, and what happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: As soon as we got there, the light was actually turning yellow. I was<br>
   like, &quot;Man, it's now or never.&quot; So, I just went ahead and got up. First<br>
   thing I did was punch the window. It cracked. After that, he turned around.<br>
   He was on the phone. I still remember the whole action. He was on the<br>
   phone, dropped the phone. He was trying to put the car in park. He was<br>
   trying to take his belt off. He was also trying to grab his gun and grab<br>
   the cell phone at the same time, but it was just too much. So I just went<br>
   ahead. And as soon as I punched the window, it came in my mind. I was like,<br>
   &quot;What am I doing?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Man, I just made this worse.&quot; So, I was like,<br>
   &quot;I might as well just complete with it.&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Right. Like the damage is done, you think?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: If I did it, I might as well just do it. Because either way, if I<br>
   don't do it, they're going to hit me with attempt to escape. It's like, &quot;I<br>
   might as well just go all the way out. I already did it.&quot; So, I just<br>
   punched the window again, and my whole body went through it. I just fell,<br>
   hit the floor, got up, hit the freeway, jumped a couple fences, hid through<br>
   a alley, and I was gone. I was gone.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: So, what happened?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: They didn't find me.<br>
 <br>

   they get ahold of you, you got to go with them.<br>

   that you had a run-in with the law when you were 12. What happened there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: Actually, I was 13.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Oh, 13.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: I was being bad. Really, I was being bad. I was with some friends, we<br>
   got into some things. Got locked up, and I did some time, came out. And<br>
   then from when I was 13, that's when everything started. I started going in<br>
   and out, doing time, till I hit 18.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Could you tell me a bit about, I guess, more details in there, like<br>
   what happened? What do you think caused that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: Money. When I was 13 I liked money a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: So, the streets called us a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: What did you like to buy?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Weco: Not even really buy, just... How can I say it? I'm going to just say<br>
   how it is. We used to be young, crazy. When I was 13, I caught my first<br>
   burglary. We broke into a house, stole a lot of things. We got caught for<br>
   it. After that, since we got placed on probation, that's when it all<br>
   started.</span><span id="84ba624a-09f0-4f06-9321-c8a45357232a" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="States, Oklahoma">Weco: In the States, Indiana.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Isabel: Indiana.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Weco: He got deported for 10 years also. After that I grew up, went to</br>   school. Time passed by, then I…</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was school like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It's all right. Boring. [crosstalk 00:01:11].</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Boring?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I didn't like school at all really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have friends at school?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I've always had a lot of friends.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How did you, like what did do you do for fun? What [inaudible</br>   00:01:20] did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: When I was young, I used to like playing football a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Soccer or American football?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Both.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Both?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: But really American football more.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. Just for fun or on a team?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Fun really. It was just street football.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, yeah. Nice. Could you tell me a bit about… I guess you said</br>   that you had a run-in with the law when you were 12. What happened there?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Actually, I was 13.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, 13.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was being bad. Really, I was being bad. I was with some friends, we</br>   got into some things. Got locked up, and I did some time, came out. And</br>   then from when I was 13, that's when everything started.

What do you think caused that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Money.

How can I say it? I'm going to just say</br>   how it is. We used to be young, crazy. When I was 13, I caught my first</br>   burglary. We broke into a house, stole a lot of things. We got caught for</br>   it. After that, since we got placed on probation, that's when it all</br>   started. I like smoking weed. I'm really a weed person. I don't mess with</br>   anything else; just weed.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's starting to be legalized in the U.S. too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It has to be legalized. It has to. Everywhere. Even here. Even here.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why do you say that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It's kind of dumb not to have weed legalized. Everybody smokes weed.</br>   Everybody growing weed. Anywhere you go, you see weed. Honestly, it's</br>   better. I think weed being legal makes a lot of things better.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I think so. And it gets a lot more people connected. From my</br>   experience, if you got some good weed, you're going to get a lot of good</br>   customers. That's real, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Is that how you formed a community with your friends, just like</br>   smoking and hanging out?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, that's what we really did: smoke, hang out. I've never really</br>   been a... Well, I was a troublemaker. But once I got deported, everything</br>   changed. I really just started relaxing.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Can you tell me about the events that led to your deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah. I got locked up for selling drugs, a gun-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was it just weed or other drugs as well?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Let me remember at that time. No, at the time it was weed and coke.</br>   It was weed and coke and a handgun. I got arrested for that. I actually</br>   went to trial. I won my case, but you know after that, immigration, once</br>   they get ahold of you, you got to go with them.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, they gave me a court date with them. But during that, I had to be</br>   transferred from one jail to another jail, from a state jail to an</br>   immigration jail. During that process, I asked the officer, I was like,</br>   &quot;What's my situation look like?&quot; Well, he told me straight up, he was like,</br>   &quot;You're deported. Your case, you got...&quot; So, I was like, &quot;All right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: During the process, I knew where we were going to. I know where I</br>   live. I know my area. You know when somebody knows where they live?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, yeah. It's your hometown.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, I was like, &quot;Man. We've got an hour to get there. I got an hour</br>   to get away. Somebody is going to lose this one.&quot; So, during that process,</br>   I actually was able to take my handcuffs off.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How'd you do that? Just removed them?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I pulled them out. I pulled them out. He didn't put them on</br>   that tight. So, I pulled them out, I got loose. After that, we had a</br>   minivan. I still remember today. It's a minivan, the middle seats are not</br>   even there. I'm in the back seat. As soon as we get to where I was knowing</br>   we was going to get to, I said, &quot;All right. We finna get off the freeway.</br>   It's a stop light. If that light turns red, I'm gone.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was 19, going on 20.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Was it like an adrenaline? Were you nervous? What was it like in</br>   that moment?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My mind was just like, &quot;Fuck it. It's my life or his life. It's going</br>   to be my life. He ain't going to...&quot; I looked at it like just, &quot;What? Just</br>   because he says and somebody higher than him says just because I'm illegal</br>   they're going to deport me? You're fucking with the wrong one. You're going</br>   to have to catch me.&quot; That's the way I looked at it. “You're fucking with</br>   the wrong one.”</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, then the light turned red, and what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: As soon as we got there, the light was actually turning yellow. I was</br>   like, &quot;Man, it's now or never.&quot; So, I just went ahead and got up. First</br>   thing I did was punch the window. It cracked. After that, he turned around.</br>   He was on the phone. I still remember the whole action. He was on the</br>   phone, dropped the phone. He was trying to put the car in park. He was</br>   trying to take his belt off. He was also trying to grab his gun and grab</br>   the cell phone at the same time, but it was just too much. So I just went</br>   ahead. And as soon as I punched the window, it came in my mind. I was like,</br>   &quot;What am I doing?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Man, I just made this worse.&quot; So, I was like,</br>   &quot;I might as well just complete with it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right. Like the damage is done, you think?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If I did it, I might as well just do it. Because either way, if I</br>   don't do it, they're going to hit me with attempt to escape. It's like, &quot;I</br>   might as well just go all the way out. I already did it.&quot; So, I just</br>   punched the window again, and my whole body went through it. I just fell,</br>   hit the floor, got up, hit the freeway, jumped a couple fences, hid through</br>   a alley, and I was gone. I was gone.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, what happened?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: They didn't find me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: They didn't find me. It took them four days to find me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where were you? Where were you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just back and forth, back and forth.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you have contact with your family at all? Did you have your kid</br>   at this time?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My baby mama was pregnant at the time.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Okay. But your kid wasn't born yet?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No, he wasn't born yet. I had contact with my people a little bit. I</br>   actually had to call my mom because I had some money that I needed to get</br>   to leave the States, because I knew the case. My case went from a state</br>   case to a federal case. They actually started wiring my mom's phone. They</br>   actually had a car outside my mom. Every time she went to work, they</br>   followed her. So, I knew my case. I made it worse. So, I was like, &quot;I got</br>   to get out the state.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you regret doing that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yes and no. Yes, because I lost a lot of opportunities. It could have</br>   been better for me. And then no, because I went all the way out. I went all</br>   the way out. Immigration knows. I know if I were to go back out there,</br>   they're going to be like, &quot;Yeah, that's-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, they know you.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: &quot;That's that motherfucker right there.&quot; And after that I did what?</br>   They caught me after four days later. I actually stayed hiding for a couple</br>   of days between houses there and then. They would follow my mama's son at</br>   the time. They would follow my mom everywhere. Actually, every time I had</br>   somebody do something for me, I would be following them while the FBI was</br>   following them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh my goodness.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It was two occasions when I see them stop my baby mama in her car and</br>   somebody else because I had them go pick up money and clothes. As they</br>   would stop them at a gas station, I'd be across the street watching the</br>   whole scene.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's so annoying. Were you entertained by this, or was it nerve</br>   wracking?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Both. I was entertained, and I was kind of nervous. I was nervous</br>   because I was like, &quot;Man, if I know I get caught right now, it's the</br>   wraps.&quot; And then at the same time, I was thinking, &quot;Oh, they're so stupid.</br>   They think they know it all, but they don't.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, so kind of mix.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, it was a mix, really.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Then you were detained for... You were how old, I guess, in this</br>   case? For two years, you said?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah. I did actually two years trying to fight my case, trying to</br>   stay legal.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were the conditions for-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Because, actually, I escaped, right?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, after four days after I got caught, they took me to jail. I</br>   actually did eight months with federal. I did federal time first. Then the</br>   judge actually gave me time served since it was my first time. I was the</br>   first offender that was 19 years old in there. Even my lawyer that was</br>   there, she was like, &quot;You're my first young offender here in federal</br>   court.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Were you way younger than everybody else there?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I don't know. I was just like, &quot;Damn. Don't tell me that. You're</br>   going to make me feel fucked up. Damn. I'm finna do some time.&quot; Because</br>   they told me maximum for that is eight years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: That's like-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So I was like, &quot;Damn. Eight years? Just to get deported after that.&quot;</br>   I was like, &quot;Man.&quot; I really didn't care about it. My main concern was I got</br>   a son on the way. I was like, &quot;Eight years just for some crap?” I was like,</br>   “yeah, I did mess up.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, then I just went. They gave me a time served. After that, I went</br>   to immigration. There I fought my case. This was a little different. Here I</br>   fought my case. They actually gave me bond here. This situation I only did</br>   in total a year and three months. I got out on bond. I went to my two</br>   immigration court dates. First one, they denied me. By the second one, my</br>   son was already born. So, my lawyer fought for it. He was like, &quot;His first</br>   time being a father,&quot; this and that. &quot;Give him an opportunity.&quot; They did.</br>   They gave me a bond, $8,000, so I paid it.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I was out for a year, then going to a party, hanging out with the</br>   friends, I got into a fight. Things happened. Luckily, I was the only one</br>   known there at that place. It was like if we go to a party, they just know</br>   me. This person got really messed up, ended up in the hospital. Three weeks</br>   later I found out I got a warrant for my arrest. I looked up, I called my</br>   lawyer and was like, &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot; He's like, &quot;For a fight. Best</br>   thing to do is turn yourself in. You got a record of escaping.&quot; As a minor,</br>   I got two escapes. As an adult, I got one. So, I'm automatically an escapee</br>   under their eyes.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, he's like, &quot;Turn yourself in. It looks better for you. It will</br>   make it look like you're trying to get things right, trying to do right.&quot;</br>   So I was like, &quot;All right. Just give me a minute. Let me get some money. I</br>   got to leave some money at home, got to leave some money for me too.&quot; He's</br>   like, &quot;All right.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: So, after that, I turned myself in. I did four months with the state.</br>   They dropped some of the charges, then I did some time. Then after that,</br>   immigration came and picked me up again for violating my first bond. Then</br>   that's when I actually did two years trying to fight my case.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: What were those two years like?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just boring, boring. Time is time. I can do time. I look at it like</br>   if you're going to do the crime, you're going to have to do the time either</br>   way. Ain't no whining or crying. That's the way I look at it, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If you really want to be out here in the streets and doing your</br>   bullshit, you're going to have to wait. You going to have to bear with the</br>   time. When I was locked up, I just really gambled. I like playing cards and</br>   gambling for money. That's how I did my two years.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you ever get to see your kid? Did he come and visit?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No? Did you get to see them before you left?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: My mama.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Your mom? You got to see her?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Only because she wanted to. I told her not to.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Why is that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I didn't want to see nobody. For me, I knew it was going to be harder</br>   for my mom than it was going to be harder for me, so I didn't want to see</br>   my mama cry. Because at the end of the day, it was going to make me hurt.</br>   So I was like, &quot;I'd rather just not see you. I haven't seen you in so many</br>   years already. To not see you before I leave to another state, I would</br>   prefer that.&quot; And I told my mama that.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: But she came anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, she came anyways. I told her, &quot;Don't come. Just leave me some</br>   money and some shit and go home.&quot; Next thing you know, I woke up, they go,</br>   &quot;You got a visit.&quot; I was like, &quot;Damn. She had to stay.&quot; And first thing she</br>   did was cry. I already knew. I was like, &quot;Ma, don't start crying, man. If</br>   you're going to visit me, don't even cry. I'm going to turn this off on you</br>   right now.&quot; And she stopped crying.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, she did?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, because I told her. I was like, &quot;I don't want to see you cry.</br>   At the end of the day, I got myself into this. What are you going to cry</br>   for?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Are you still in contact?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Actually, since I got deported, my communication with my mom,</br>   everybody, has kind of been down. We don't talk like that no more.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Before we get to that, just to go back a little bit, can you tell</br>   me about your deportation and return to Mexico a bit? I guess return in</br>   parentheses, since you kind of grew up...</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It was all right. It kind of was hard to get used to it, walking</br>   around, looking. I'm used to having my car out there, having my own things.</br>   So, having to go from a car to a train, which is a metro here, going out</br>   there, it was difficult. Food wise, I'm used to just eating anything over</br>   there and going to some quick restaurant, whatever it is, fast food.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. What do you miss the most?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Where I stayed at, we had Steak 'n Shake Rally's. I miss that so</br>   much. Out here we don't have that. The only thing I've actually had out</br>   here was IHOP, which is good. I like IHOP. But other than that, McDonald's</br>   don’t taste the same, I think. It's kind of different.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: No, I think that's pretty common. Do you think that your adjustment</br>   was more difficult because you didn't really grow up here at all?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did it feel like you were entering just a completely new country?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what it felt like, like they just dropped me off in the</br>   jungle.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Just said, &quot;Here. Just go from here. You're on your own.&quot; And mainly</br>   it's just I had no family out here. They just dropped me off and said,</br>   &quot;You're on your own.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: We walked in here, and two people were like, &quot;Hey, what's up?&quot; How</br>   did you make your community here, some friends? Do you feel like you have</br>   any, I guess? I don't want to assume anything. Do you feel like you have?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, yeah. I have. The way I am, the way I carry myself, and the way</br>   I talk. One thing my mama always told me since I was little, she was like,</br>   &quot;No matter what, tell the truth. You've got to keep it real. If you don't</br>   like somebody let them know. 'I don't like you. I ain't going to talk.' If</br>   you like somebody, let them know. 'You're all right. We can talk,</br>   whatever.' If you don't, just avoid the people.&quot; My mama always told me</br>   that. &quot;Keep it real. Number one thing: keep it real no matter what.&quot; That's</br>   what I do, and a lot of people like me for that, because no matter what or</br>   who it is, I keep it real. I done have occasions with my supervisors where</br>   I lit them up. I don't care. I go, &quot;You're just my supervisor.&quot; It's just</br>   the way it is. If I don't like the way you treat me, I'm going to let you</br>   know. I'm going to talk the way I have to talk.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where do you think… you said your mom instilled that kind of</br>   mentality or value. Do you attribute a lot of your personality and stuff to</br>   your mom? Or what do you think really shaped you?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I think my mom on one hand side, and the streets. My mom and the</br>   streets.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: In what way?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Because my mom was hard with me. She was never that, &quot;What you need?</br>   I got you.&quot; Or &quot;What's going on? I got you.&quot; She was like, &quot;What's going</br>   on? That's your problem. You did that. That's your problem. You need what?</br>   Go get it yourself.&quot; I had a hard mom. I love her though, but she was</br>   pretty tough on me.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, tough love.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Tough love. More than my brothers, because they can ask for, &quot;Oh, I</br>   need this.&quot; &quot;Get them.&quot; I don't see why she did that, but sometimes I'd be</br>   like it might've been for a good thing because I am who I am now.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: And your brothers are citizens, right?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, my brothers are citizens.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So, you were the oldest and you were born in Mexico before you came</br>   here?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yep.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you ever talk about that together? Was there ever a dynamic or</br>   differences in what you were able to do?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Oh, yeah, I used to... With my mom?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, no. Just with you. Or with your mom too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No, I used to tell my mama like, &quot;Damn, mom. You should've got</br>   pregnant in the States. You should have had me out there. I wouldn't be out</br>   here suffering.&quot; But I like it though. I look at it like it's a life</br>   experience. Everything's an adventure in this life. As soon as I got</br>   deported, I was like, &quot;This is an adventure.&quot; They say Mexico is bad. Out</br>   here it's not bad. Out here there's just a lot of cops. You see everybody.</br>   You can get took care of. You can get robbed or whatever, the camo is out</br>   there. If you go to where I live, it's a whole-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Where do you live?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Ecatepec. It's known for the worst area, and it's known for its...</br>   It's just known. Even Ubers won't go out there.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I don't know anything. What's it known for?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Stealing, kidnapping, killing, drugs. Yeah, it's pretty bad.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, it sounds pretty intense.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It is. It is. A lot of people tell me I got to get up out of there,</br>   but I grew up out there in the States too in the hood, you know, and I like</br>   the hood. It's part of me. I like it. I've had women before. Women are</br>   like, &quot;I'm going to take you out.&quot; Sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: So that's sort of ironically your comfort zone in a way? [crosstalk</br>   00:18:22].</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I like it. I like it. Yeah, it's my comfort zone. I like it because I</br>   can be me. Because I know out here if I talk some certain way or dress some</br>   certain way or whatever some way, They're not out to judge like that.</br>   That's the number one thing out here in Mexico I don't like. They're quick</br>   to judge you. You got a tattoo, you got some type of dress, you smoke,</br>   whatever, they're quick to judge you. I don't like that. So, I prefer being</br>   in the hood because the hood knows what it's like. The hood suffers. I've</br>   been through not having no money. I done been through having to struggle,</br>   having to get some money. I know what it's like suffering, so I prefer</br>   being with the people that know what it's like to being with some other</br>   people that don't know what it's like. Because at the end of the day, they</br>   get it all. They're being able to get whatever they want whenever they</br>   want.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: And on the other side, you're not. You're having to suffer. You're</br>   having to deal with it. You actually live in reality. You're not living a</br>   dream. You're not getting things from other people. You're having to get it</br>   on your own. That's what sorted me out here as soon as I got out here,</br>   because out there in the States, if I had a problem or something, I could</br>   hit somebody up or my mom. I would just be like, &quot;Hey, let me borrow some,</br>   and I'll pay you back.&quot; Out here you're on your own.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Hm.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Since I've been out here, yeah, I lost more contact with my family,</br>   relationship's going lower than what it was back then. But the way I look</br>   at it, we're all borrowed in this life. We're just born one time. We're</br>   going to die at the end of the day. I told my mama that one time, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Mom, I'm borrowed. At the end of the day, I'm really not even yours. I was</br>   born, you take care of me 18 years, and I'm gone on my own. At the end of</br>   the day, that’s what’s going to happen. Everybody continues with their own</br>   life. At the end of the day, you're going to die some day. My life is going</br>   to continue. My brother's life is going to continue. Everybody's going life</br>   continue. Why cry? Why suffer? What's the point of it?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: We only have so much time.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Exactly. Might as well just enjoy my time. If I can have you with me,</br>   of course I'm going to enjoy the time. But if I can't, and I'm the one who</br>   did this, then I'm going to deal with it. I'm going to suffer the</br>   consequences.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Have you come to terms with it?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, continue. So, this is kind of going against what you were</br>   saying in terms of just living in the moment and just taking things as they</br>   are…</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: … but if I were to just stretch you a little bit, what would your</br>   hopes be if you were still in the U.S.? What would you like to be doing?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: If I was still in the U.S., I think I'd still have my job that I had</br>   out there, which was the cleaning, and I'd just be out there taking care of</br>   my son. That's all I was out there. When I actually got out on my bond and</br>   I had my son with me for that period of time, that's all I did. Just went</br>   to work, relaxed, came home. That's it. That's all I really done. After I</br>   had my son, I really stopped. I stopped all my bull crap. I grew up without</br>   a father, so I know what it's like. I told myself that's what they want,</br>   and I actually failed at that because I'm down here and he's down there. It</br>   hurts me sometimes, but at the end of the day, I made the decision. So, I</br>   have to deal with that. But I can tell everybody he going to grow up. He</br>   going to know the truth. He's going to know I fucked up. So if he accepts</br>   it, then we go from there. If he don't, I got to deal with the consequence.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. We ask that question partially because there's a lot of</br>   assumptions and stereotypes about who the U.S. is deporting. I think it's</br>   important to know like, &quot;What do you think you would be doing in the U.S.&quot;</br>   And like, &quot;Oh, I'd be taking care of my son. I didn't have a father growing</br>   up, and yeah, I did some stuff I regret or maybe made some mistakes in the</br>   past. But I knew what I would be doing then.&quot; There's the assumption like,</br>   &quot;Oh, well, here's his track record, and that's what he'd continue to be</br>   doing. We need to deport him.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what they really go off, the record. That's all I remember. He</br>   just looked me up. &quot;His record is this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: They don't look at the person.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's what I used to fight. That's why I actually stayed two years,</br>   because I was trying to fight them.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah, you believed in yourself.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I was like, &quot;I messed up at that first time. Yeah, I escaped. I</br>   did my case were bigger than what it was supposed to be. You caught me. I'm</br>   not going to lie. You caught me. And if you did it-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You were still pretty smart about it though.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, yeah. I was like, &quot;If you didn't catch me, I'd still be there</br>   right now. But no, things worked out for a reason. You caught me for a</br>   reason.&quot; Everything happened for a reason. And like I told the judge before</br>   they deported me, I was like, &quot;Look, Your Honor, I turned myself in. I got</br>   the record of not turning myself in. I actually got a record of escaping,</br>   running from the law during transportation, during whatever the situation</br>   is. But that's my record, running.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Weco: And I told him just like that. &quot;I'm actually trying to change. I got</br>   a son that was just born. He's not that many months old. It's something</br>   big, you know something big for me.&quot; But all I remember is actually him</br>   asking my baby mama, &quot;Does he got insurance?&quot; She was like, &quot;Yeah. Anything</br>   would happen to him, insurance will cover him. He don't need his dad.&quot; So I</br>   just stood quiet. I was just like, &quot;All right.&quot; My judge, my lawyer was</br>   like, &quot;Anything else?&quot; I just told him... I really went off. I just told</br>   the judge, I was like, &quot;Think what you want. Feel how you want. But at the</br>   end of the day, somehow, some way, I'm a gonna to come back. You can take</br>   me away from my mom, anybody, but not my son. At the end of the day, I'm a</br>   gonna to come back. You're a judge. You've just got a black thing on. You</br>   ain't nobody to tell me shit. You ain't nobody. This courtroom ain't</br>   nobody. These handcuffs ain't nobody.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Did you say this?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I said that during courtroom.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Wow. You really did tell them. You're really honest. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I told him. My lawyer kept telling me to be quiet, and I told</br>   my lawyer, &quot;No. Fuck that. You know, They're going-&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: It's already been [crosstalk 00:24:00].</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I'm already deported. What else are they going to do? Keep me</br>   here another month? I don't think they're going to want that. They want me</br>   out of here. So, I just let the judge know how I felt. I told him, &quot;Either</br>   way, somehow I'm going to come back, legal or illegal.&quot; At the end of the</br>   day, you're not going to stop no Mexican from coming over. No one will.</br>   Never.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: The president's learning that the hard way, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: The way I look at it, and I told him, I'm like, &quot;I actually feel like</br>   we're better than you mentality wise, because you're building walls. You're</br>   building anything, underground, whatever, and we're still coming over.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Still coming over. Somehow, some way, we're still coming over. Either</br>   it's 10 people, or there's five people. It's either one, or it's 20. But</br>   we're coming over, and you're not going to stop it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I'm sure he loved to hear that.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I'd love to pass out to Trump too.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Well, we're trying to create a platform for you to be able to have</br>   a voice as well. To flip that question to now that you are in Mexico, what</br>   do want to do? Do you have any hopes? I know you said you want to go back</br>   to the U.S. Is that the goal, or what it is for right now?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I don't know really. I have been through so much in life. I just look</br>   at it as just whatever's going to happen is going to happen now. You can</br>   plan something for now, but shit changes. Sometimes things go from good to</br>   bad. Some things bad from good. You can't really tell life. It's destiny. I</br>   just made it to my mind where we're going to take it day by day. Whatever</br>   happens, happens. If I make it back, I would be so excited. If I don't, I</br>   don't. But at the end of the day, I look at it like either way, if I'm</br>   going to be here... I got deported 10 years. I've been here two. So, if I'm</br>   going to be here for 10 years, trying to be good and try to go back, I at</br>   least got to have some type of a life. I'm going to date somebody if I'm</br>   going to have more kids or whatever. But at the end of the day, I have that</br>   right to live my life. So, I just live it day by day.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Day by day. Because at the end of the day, I could end up getting a</br>   girl out here or meeting a girl out here that will change my mentality. And</br>   it'll be like, &quot;You know what? I actually like it.&quot; Things happen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. Who knows?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Things happen. I just look at it like that. Things happen. Or I could</br>   get the opportunity to go back, or I could die. It's just life. I just look</br>   at it day by day. Whatever happens is going to happen.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: A lot of people we talk to, I think, understandably so, feel kind</br>   of frozen in time. They think like their life is continuing in the U.S.</br>   without them, and that can be really difficult to reconcile with being in</br>   Mexico too.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I had it like that. My first year I had it like that. I would look at</br>   the time, and I'd be like, &quot;Down there it's this time.&quot; I would live off</br>   that time instead of living off this time. Every day I'd be like, &quot;If I was</br>   down there, I'd be doing this. If I was eating right now, I'd be eating</br>   this.&quot; My mind wouldn't be here. My body would be here, but my mind</br>   wouldn't be over... Till it just clicked in. I was like, &quot;Man, you're</br>   screwed, dude. You're not going nowhere. Just get that shit out your mind</br>   and let’s face reality.&quot; That's what I'm doing: facing reality.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: I think that takes a lot of willpower though.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It does, but what other option do we have? A lot of people would</br>   rather just live off a dream or live off something else instead of facing</br>   reality and looking at it like you know, this is life. I have no other</br>   option. This is what I got to deal with. Some other people would rather</br>   just give themselves a visuality or a dream that ah, things will get better</br>   or this or that. I look at it no, life is life. If it gets better, it gets</br>   better. If it don't, it don't. But at the end of the way, you're living</br>   life. At the end of the day, this is one life we have. Why waste it? It's</br>   one time. We ain't gonna to live this life again. Why waste it? I had my</br>   fun in the States. I won't lie. I did everything I wanted to. Once I got</br>   deported, I just, you know, all I do here is work. I smoke weed. I like</br>   weed. I don't lie.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Do you think weed is just something to relax here and have fun, or</br>   do you think it gives you a break from where you are?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, it can do both, depending also on the person. Every person's</br>   body is different. Every person takes it different. Me, I actually take it</br>   to relax me. Sometimes I actually just take it just to have fun, relax and</br>   chill, depending on the moment. There are days I work when I get so</br>   frustrated I just need to smoke to just relax my mind where I'm just like,</br>   &quot;All right, I'm cool.&quot; Because it brings me to where, &quot;Fuck it. It was just</br>   a phone call. It was his job. Fuck ‘em. It is what it is.&quot; And then when</br>   I'm with friends, we're just like, &quot;Oh yeah, let's smoke. Just laughs.&quot;</br>   Right there it's just haha, giggles, laughs, you're just clowning on</br>   people.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Everything's funny.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, everything's funny. You're just roasting. And I'm one of those.</br>   I get to roasting everybody. I just like to have fun. So, yeah. sometimes I</br>   do use weed to get my depression out.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Sometimes it comes around when you get depressed being out here on</br>   your own. But like I said, I just smoke. When I smoke, it goes away. My</br>   mentality switches to, &quot;Look, you're on your own. Why suffer? Why cry?&quot; My</br>   mentality just switches quick, and I stop being depressed about it. It is</br>   what it is. Why?</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yeah. You said it was harder at first when you came here-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: In the beginning.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: ... and it's gotten better as you [crosstalk 00:29:42]-</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I just look at it like it's-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: ... or do you think it fluctuates?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It floats, but I'm happy in my life. That's all that really matters.</br>   I'm alive. Either way, I'm good. Either way, I'm good. I don't care. I</br>   could be over there. I could be over here. I'm good.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Nice. We have some questions that we ask everyone. You can do with</br>   them what you will. Do you consider yourself Mexican or American? American</br>   like United States.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Mexican.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Mexican? Why is that?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: It's in my blood. It's running through my veins. If I wasn't Mexican,</br>   they wouldn't talk about, &quot;Oh, you gotta get deported.&quot; It's in my veins. I</br>   always say I'm Mexican. I'm proud of it. I love it. It's in my veins. We're</br>   the shit. We're the shit. This is the way I look at it. Where I was at in</br>   the States, a lot of construction workers, a lot of working places outside,</br>   any type of hard work was really us. Really us. Hot sun, any type of thing,</br>   it's us. Also, drug wise, it's us. We're out there. We're both ways.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: You are really honest.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I'm just being honest. We're both ways, and Mexico is known for that.</br>   A lot of good people, working people, and then there's drug people. They've</br>   got both. But at the end of the day, it's just not us. Everywhere in the</br>   world there's going to be drugs. Everywhere in the world. It doesn't</br>   necessarily come from Mexico. Come from other States in the world, you</br>   know, Cuba, other places. Russia even moves things out there too. They're</br>   the mafia. They go on a big-</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Oh, they're not messing around.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: I'll mess around and go to Russia too.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Yes. Maybe you have a better perspective than I do.</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, I like it though. I like it. I like life. I like life. You</br>   learn things. When you're in the streetwise, you learn a lot of things. You</br>   also, you learn to appreciate life. That's what you really do, because you</br>   go through experience, you go through things where you actually learn to</br>   appreciate life. It gets to a point in life where like, you're just like,</br>   &quot;Damn. I did it all. I just want to relax.&quot; That's where I'm at. I did it</br>   all. I just want to go to work, smoke weed, and just chill. That's all I do</br>   every day.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: Is there anything you'd like to add or you want people to know</br>   about your experience?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: No. All they hear is to legalize weed. That's it. That's it.</br> </br> </br>   Isabel: To end on that note?</br> </br> </br>   Weco: Yeah, that's it.</br> </div><\p>
