 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I don't know if it would be a big thing since I was always kind of<br>
   with my dad, and I would see my mom almost every... I would come back every<br>
   Mother's Day or Christmas kind of thing. Come back to see her, and then I<br>
   would just basically just jump it again. Since dad knew people that would<br>
   cross the border quite often, that's where they would do it.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: In the States I finished my high school out there, and I was<br>
   actually studying a little bit of college, but after the dumb Trump kind of<br>
   thing came in place, I was just like, &quot;Eh.&quot; And my mom had cancer at the<br>
   time—she was fighting her cancer. So I ended up just saying, &quot;I'm going<br>
   back out to Mexico to live this time and actually live out here.&quot; I ended<br>
   up just coming back, and just forgetting about college over there, and came<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What did you do in the States? What did you like to do for fun?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Out in the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I actually had a sponsor for snowboarding and surfing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Holy shit, that's awesome.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: That's basically what I did. I just got paid to do that. And when I<br>
   wasn't working with that, I would travel a lot with my dad. My dad would<br>
   work with construction. I would just be with my dad or do my thing, and<br>
   that's it, basically.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What did you like about snowboarding and surfing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Let's see, snowboarding. I would always go back out to Utah, to<br>
   Salt Lake, cause I loved snowboarding there and plus we'd always get free<br>
   gear out there from the sponsor. The best part I probably like out there<br>
   was camping out in the mountains. I really like camping a lot, I don't know<br>
   why, it's just something I always did like. [Chuckle]. And from surfing, I<br>
   don't know, it was always really into water.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I can remember when I was just a little kid, my dad would actually<br>
   take me out to San Francisco and Venice Beach and all those kinds of<br>
   beaches to just kick it. And I would see a bunch of my cousins surfing, so<br>
   I think that's where it came on. I think I like almost any other sport,<br>
   really, it's just like something that my dad put us into. He would take me,<br>
   and I have two little brothers, out dirt biking a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: When you say you had a sponsorship, does that mean that you<br>
   competed?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Yeah. It usually would take us out, and my dad would actually come<br>
   with me, since I was still a minor, and it would just get a couple of<br>
   videos into it, just do my stuff basically. That's all I would do.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Did you ever see yourself doing that when you were older?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I actually used to get paid for that out there, but just since I<br>
   did end up just coming out to Mexico, I talked to my sponsor—which his name<br>
   was called Jones, he was my manager out there—and I told him, &quot;Hey, you<br>
   know what? I'm going out to Mexico.&quot; And I got to say thanks and that's it.<br>
   And he actually tried—when I got out to Mexico, I had contact with him a<br>
   lot—he's telling me, &quot;Hey, I want to see if we can get you a green card or<br>
   something.&quot; I kind of didn't want to go back out to the States. I kind of<br>
   just wanted to stay here. I really didn't even know Mexico, so that was<br>
   part of it. I surfed a couple of times here in Mexico, but it's expensive<br>
   out here to do something. You can't really do much.<br>

   Claudia: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I actually had a sponsor for snowboarding and surfing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Holy shit, that's awesome.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: That's basically what I did. I just got paid to do that. And when I<br>
   wasn't working with that, I would travel a lot with my dad. My dad would<br>
   work with construction. I would just be with my dad or do my thing, and<br>
   that's it, basically.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What did you like about snowboarding and surfing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Let's see, snowboarding. I would always go back out to Utah, to<br>
   Salt Lake, cause I loved snowboarding there and plus we'd always get free<br>
   gear out there from the sponsor. The best part I probably like out there<br>
   was camping out in the mountains. I really like camping a lot, I don't know<br>
   why, it's just something I always did like. [Chuckle]. And from surfing, I<br>
   don't know, it was always really into water.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I can remember when I was just a little kid, my dad would actually<br>
   take me out to San Francisco and Venice Beach and all those kinds of<br>
   beaches to just kick it. And I would see a bunch of my cousins surfing, so<br>
   I think that's where it came on. I think I like almost any other sport,<br>
   really, it's just like something that my dad put us into. He would take me,<br>
   and I have two little brothers, out dirt biking a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: When you say you had a sponsorship, does that mean that you<br>
   competed?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Yeah. It usually would take us out, and my dad would actually come<br>
   with me, since I was still a minor, and it would just get a couple of<br>
   videos into it, just do my stuff basically. That's all I would do.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Did you ever see yourself doing that when you were older?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I actually used to get paid for that out there, but just since I<br>
   did end up just coming out to Mexico, I talked to my sponsor—which his name<br>
   was called Jones, he was my manager out there—and I told him, &quot;Hey, you<br>
   know what? I'm going out to Mexico.&quot; And I got to say thanks and that's it.<br>
   And he actually tried—when I got out to Mexico, I had contact with him a<br>
   lot—he's telling me, &quot;Hey, I want to see if we can get you a green card or<br>
   something.&quot; I kind of didn't want to go back out to the States. I kind of<br>
   just wanted to stay here. I really didn't even know Mexico, so that was<br>
   part of it. I surfed a couple of times here in Mexico, but it's expensive<br>
   out here to do something. You can't really do much.<br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: In the States I finished my high school out there, and I was<br>
   actually studying a little bit of college, but after the dumb Trump kind of<br>
   thing came in place, I was just like, &quot;Eh.&quot; And my mom had cancer at the<br>
   time—she was fighting her cancer. So I ended up just saying, &quot;I'm going<br>
   back out to Mexico to live this time and actually live out here.&quot; I ended<br>
   up just coming back, and just forgetting about college over there, and came<br>
   back here to Mexico to actually live. And of course I was actually helping<br>

It didn't hurt quite as much as I thought it would, it</br>   was just more like, &quot;Oh my eyes are really like, tiring,&quot; kind of stuff, so</br>   that didn't really hurt. I think the worst I've ever had hurt was probably</br>   right here on the collarbone area.

That's what I could say.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Did you join anyone when you were over there?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah. I got jumped in, 15,16, with a family kind of thing when</br>   they're out there. That was basically not a really big choice for me. All</br>   the family was in there, so that's all I could say on that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How was that?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Basically, there's a very big process into it, which is kind of, I</br>   don’t know.

   here. Those are my two brothers, so I decided to get them, and I got my mom<br>
   tattooed on my head.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Oh wow, that's amazing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: That's probably one of my favorite ones. Let's see, I had a cousin<br>
   that got shot out in the States out in Utah, so I ended up getting a Salt<br>
   Lake tattoo right here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Oh, I see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I guess there's a couple. I got these two right here, it's probably<br>
   my favorite tattoo, actually. It says—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Did that hurt a lot? I know that's a stupid question, but I'm just<br>
   very curious.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: [Laughs]. It didn't hurt quite as much as I thought it would, it<br>
   was just more like, &quot;Oh my eyes are really like, tiring,&quot; kind of stuff, so<br>
   that didn't really hurt. I think the worst I've ever had hurt was probably<br>
   right here on the collarbone area. Yeah, that's probably the worst.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: We've heard from a lot of people here tattoos are kind of<br>
   associated with gangs and criminal activity over in the States, and that's<br>
   why a lot of migrants when they come back get profiled. Do you think that's<br>
   true?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I have to tell you, I'm going to guess that's really true. Because<br>
   it's just something really common up there. Either you join something and<br>
   you're known as hardcore, you're known as somebody, or you don't join<br>
   anything and you get bullied around. That's what I could say.<br>

  </span> Claudia: Did you join anyone when you were over there?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah. I got jumped in, 15,16, with a family kind of thing when</br>   they're out there.

All</br>   the family was in there, so that's all I could say on that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How was that?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Basically, there's a very big process into it, which is kind of, I</br>   don’t know.

   there. I was doing my elementary school and then after that I moved out to<br>
   Utah and started doing a little bit of my middle school and after that I<br>
   was kind of moving around a lot of places, I guess just working—my dad got<br>
   me a job working for construction. And I was doing my high school online, a<br>
   kind of homeschool thing. That was pretty interesting. I would come back to<br>
   Mexico quite often. I would kind of just jump the border and come see my<br>
   mom, and then I jumped it again.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Claudia: And you would go back?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How many times did you say that you did that?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Six or eight times just jumping it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You were over there without your parents or anybody?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: With my dad. I was already with my dad.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How did it feel to be separated from your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I don't know if it would be a big thing since I was always kind of</br>   with my dad, and I would see my mom almost every... I would come back every</br>   Mother's Day or Christmas kind of thing. Come back to see her, and then I</br>   would just basically just jump it again. Since dad knew people that would</br>   cross the border quite often, that's where they would do it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I see. Did you like school? What did you get up to in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: In the States I finished my high school out there, and I was</br>   actually studying a little bit of college, but after the dumb Trump kind of</br>   thing came in place, I was just like, &quot;Eh.&quot; And my mom had cancer at the</br>   time—she was fighting her cancer.

And of course I was actually helping</br>   my mom with the cancer thing.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What did you do in the States? What did you like to do for fun?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Out in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I actually had a sponsor for snowboarding and surfing.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Holy shit, that's awesome.</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: That's basically what I did. I just got paid to do that. And when I</br>   wasn't working with that, I would travel a lot with my dad. My dad would</br>   work with construction. I would just be with my dad or do my thing, and</br>   that's it, basically.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What did you like about snowboarding and surfing?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Let's see, snowboarding. I would always go back out to Utah, to</br>   Salt Lake, cause I loved snowboarding there and plus we'd always get free</br>   gear out there from the sponsor. The best part I probably like out there</br>   was camping out in the mountains. I really like camping a lot, I don't know</br>   why, it's just something I always did like. [Chuckle]. And from surfing, I</br>   don't know, it was always really into water.</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I can remember when I was just a little kid, my dad would actually</br>   take me out to San Francisco and Venice Beach and all those kinds of</br>   beaches to just kick it. And I would see a bunch of my cousins surfing, so</br>   I think that's where it came on. I think I like almost any other sport,</br>   really, it's just like something that my dad put us into. He would take me,</br>   and I have two little brothers, out dirt biking a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: When you say you had a sponsorship, does that mean that you</br>   competed?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah. It usually would take us out, and my dad would actually come</br>   with me, since I was still a minor, and it would just get a couple of</br>   videos into it, just do my stuff basically. That's all I would do.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Did you ever see yourself doing that when you were older?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I actually used to get paid for that out there, but just since I</br>   did end up just coming out to Mexico, I talked to my sponsor—which his name</br>   was called Jones, he was my manager out there—and I told him, &quot;Hey, you</br>   know what? I'm going out to Mexico.&quot; And I got to say thanks and that's it.</br>   And he actually tried—when I got out to Mexico, I had contact with him a</br>   lot—he's telling me, &quot;Hey, I want to see if we can get you a green card or</br>   something.&quot; I kind of didn't want to go back out to the States. I kind of</br>   just wanted to stay here. I really didn't even know Mexico, so that was</br>   part of it. I surfed a couple of times here in Mexico, but it's expensive</br>   out here to do something. You can't really do much.</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I tried finishing my university out in Mexico, but this is the same</br>   thing. It's really hard to put your hours to work and go to school and</br>   stuff like that. It's just really hard out here.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How long did you live in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Let's see, about 24 years. Out here in Mexico, I've probably been</br>   here for like a year and a half. Just barely, I guess.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What was it like coming back to Mexico? You said you made the</br>   decision on your own?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah, I mean, I already did know about it just a little bit, so it</br>   wasn't too bad. It was just basically like Los Angeles, it's the same</br>   thing, really. Just the differences, the corruption out here, and how</br>   people treat you. I would probably walk down the street, and I would always</br>   get a dirty look or something. I'd always get checked by the cops here,</br>   that's a constant thing for me.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Why? Do you think it's because of all the tattoos?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Probably, that's probably why it is. The way you dress.</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Since I do remember I was maybe 17 or 16 when I started getting</br>   tattooed drunk.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Here or in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Out in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What did you like about tattoos?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Basically, the story it tells. There's a lot of things into it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Do you have a favorite one?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: My favorite one would probably be like I have these two angels</br>   here. Those are my two brothers, so I decided to get them, and I got my mom</br>   tattooed on my head.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Oh wow, that's amazing.</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: That's probably one of my favorite ones. Let's see, I had a cousin</br>   that got shot out in the States out in Utah, so I ended up getting a Salt</br>   Lake tattoo right here.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Oh, I see.</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I guess there's a couple. I got these two right here, it's probably</br>   my favorite tattoo, actually. It says—</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Did that hurt a lot? I know that's a stupid question, but I'm just</br>   very curious.</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: [Laughs]. It didn't hurt quite as much as I thought it would, it</br>   was just more like, &quot;Oh my eyes are really like, tiring,&quot; kind of stuff, so</br>   that didn't really hurt. I think the worst I've ever had hurt was probably</br>   right here on the collarbone area. Yeah, that's probably the worst.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: We've heard from a lot of people here tattoos are kind of</br>   associated with gangs and criminal activity over in the States, and that's</br>   why a lot of migrants when they come back get profiled. Do you think that's</br>   true?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I have to tell you, I'm going to guess that's really true. Because</br>   it's just something really common up there. Either you join something and</br>   you're known as hardcore, you're known as somebody, or you don't join</br>   anything and you get bullied around. That's what I could say.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Did you join anyone when you were over there?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah. I got jumped in, 15,16, with a family kind of thing when</br>   they're out there. That was basically not a really big choice for me. All</br>   the family was in there, so that's all I could say on that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How was that?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Basically, there's a very big process into it, which is kind of, I</br>   don’t know. Probably we shouldn't talk about it too much.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What's been the hardest part back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: The hardest part here in Mexico is actually I'm trying to live here</br>   with the economy that they have. One day transport is cheap, the next day</br>   it goes up, and then it keeps going up, and you're just like, &quot;Oh.&quot; It's</br>   just really hard to keep up with it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What have you been up to in this past year and a half that you've</br>   been here?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: This past year I moved in with my girlfriend, so I've been here</br>   ever since, and we met each other here. So I ended up moving out with her,</br>   and I'm trying to do my university but it's kind of hard and stuff like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What are you trying to study?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I was actually doing a graphic designs and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Cool!</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: That was always something I did like. And now in the States I</br>   actually had an administration, so that was probably one of those two.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Are you currently working or what are you doing?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah, currently I had a cousin that got me to work here at T-Tech,</br>   so I guess that was it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Do you like T-Tech?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah, it’s a pretty interesting place.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: In what ways?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: It kind of reminds me of the high school out in the States. That's</br>   basically that's all I can say about it. [Chuckle]</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: In what way does it remind you of a high school?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: With all the people in there, basically it's a high school. That's</br>   how high school is out there. It just reminded me exactly like in</br>   California high school.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: In what ways do you think that being in the U.S. all that time</br>   shaped who you are?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I think the only way I can put it really is just being strong.</br>   Because basically you got to learn how to mature in a faster way than you'd</br>   probably do it here. I've seen a couple of family members or friends here</br>   that are like 30 years old and they're still living with their dad and mom.</br>   They're just like not doing anything for their life, and opposed of people</br>   out there, most of them that I do know were just living by themselves and</br>   doing their thing. I'd say out there it's probably not that good because</br>   you’d get, because most of the people would get into some kind of a drug</br>   addiction or something like that. I’d say, here, here it'd be probably the</br>   same, but out there it'd be easier to make money. Here it's a lot harder.</br>   That's probably what's the difference here to there. That's what I'm</br>   saying, I think out there you learn how to be strong. When you come here,</br>   you're just like, &quot;Oh.&quot; most people get depressed or frustrated here.</br>   Others actually know how to move on and continue. That's probably how I see</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I've actually always said I consider myself Mexican. American, no,</br>   I was never that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: If you could have stayed in the U.S., what do you think you might</br>   have done?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I probably would have finished my university out there.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Where were you going to school?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: I was studying in the University of Utah, so that was pretty</br>   interesting.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: And now that you're back in Mexico, what do you think you'd like</br>   to do over here, dreams?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="5ab6a2dc-bbc3-4ca2-ad30-3bc49e0bf47a" onclick="" style="background: #ddd" class="anno" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Continuing education">Yosell: I just want to finish my university.

I would always go back out to Utah, to<br>
   Salt Lake, cause I loved snowboarding there and plus we'd always get free<br>
   gear out there from the sponsor. The best part I probably like out there<br>
   was camping out in the mountains. I really like camping a lot, I don't know<br>
   why, it's just something I always did like. [Chuckle]. And from surfing, I<br>
   don't know, it was always really into water.<br>

   there. I was doing my elementary school and then after that I moved out to<br>
   Utah and started doing a little bit of my middle school and after that I<br>
   was kind of moving around a lot of places, I guess just working—my dad got<br>
   me a job working for construction. And I was doing my high school online, a<br>
   kind of homeschool thing. That was pretty interesting. I would come back to<br>
   Mexico quite often. I would kind of just jump the border and come see my<br>
   mom, and then I jumped it again.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Claudia: And you would go back?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How many times did you say that you did that?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: Six or eight times just jumping it.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You were over there without your parents or anybody?</br> </br> </br>   Yosell: With my dad.

 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What did you do in the States? What did you like to do for fun?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Out in the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I actually had a sponsor for snowboarding and surfing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Holy shit, that's awesome.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: That's basically what I did. I just got paid to do that. And when I<br>
   wasn't working with that, I would travel a lot with my dad. My dad would<br>
   work with construction. I would just be with my dad or do my thing, and<br>
   that's it, basically.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What did you like about snowboarding and surfing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Let's see, snowboarding. I would always go back out to Utah, to<br>
   Salt Lake, cause I loved snowboarding there and plus we'd always get free<br>
   gear out there from the sponsor. The best part I probably like out there<br>
   was camping out in the mountains. I really like camping a lot, I don't know<br>
   why, it's just something I always did like. [Chuckle]. And from surfing, I<br>
   don't know, it was always really into water.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I can remember when I was just a little kid, my dad would actually<br>
   take me out to San Francisco and Venice Beach and all those kinds of<br>
   beaches to just kick it. And I would see a bunch of my cousins surfing, so<br>
   I think that's where it came on. I think I like almost any other sport,<br>
   really, it's just like something that my dad put us into. He would take me,<br>
   and I have two little brothers, out dirt biking a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: When you say you had a sponsorship, does that mean that you<br>
   competed?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Yeah. It usually would take us out, and my dad would actually come<br>
   with me, since I was still a minor, and it would just get a couple of<br>
   videos into it, just do my stuff basically. That's all I would do.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Did you ever see yourself doing that when you were older?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I actually used to get paid for that out there, but just since I<br>
   did end up just coming out to Mexico, I talked to my sponsor—which his name<br>
   was called Jones, he was my manager out there—and I told him, &quot;Hey, you<br>
   know what? I'm going out to Mexico.&quot; And I got to say thanks and that's it.<br>
   And he actually tried—when I got out to Mexico, I had contact with him a<br>
   lot—he's telling me, &quot;Hey, I want to see if we can get you a green card or<br>
   something.&quot; I kind of didn't want to go back out to the States. I kind of<br>
   just wanted to stay here. I really didn't even know Mexico, so that was<br>
   part of it. I surfed a couple of times here in Mexico, but it's expensive<br>
   out here to do something. You can't really do much.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I tried finishing my university out in Mexico, but this is the same<br>
   thing. It's really hard to put your hours to work and go to school and<br>
   stuff like that. It's just really hard out here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: How long did you live in the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Let's see, about 24 years. Out here in Mexico, I've probably been<br>
   here for like a year and a half. Just barely, I guess.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What was it like coming back to Mexico? You said you made the<br>
   decision on your own?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Yeah, I mean, I already did know about it just a little bit, so it<br>
   wasn't too bad. It was just basically like Los Angeles, it's the same<br>
   thing, really. Just the differences, the corruption out here, and how<br>
   people treat you. I would probably walk down the street, and I would always<br>
   get a dirty look or something. I'd always get checked by the cops here,<br>
   that's a constant thing for me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Why? Do you think it's because of all the tattoos?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Probably, that's probably why it is. The way you dress.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Since I do remember I was maybe 17 or 16 when I started getting<br>
   tattooed drunk.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Here or in the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Out in the States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What did you like about tattoos?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Basically, the story it tells. There's a lot of things into it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Do you have a favorite one?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: My favorite one would probably be like I have these two angels<br>
   here. Those are my two brothers, so I decided to get them, and I got my mom<br>
   tattooed on my head.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Oh wow, that's amazing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: That's probably one of my favorite ones. Let's see, I had a cousin<br>
   that got shot out in the States out in Utah, so I ended up getting a Salt<br>
   Lake tattoo right here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Oh, I see.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I guess there's a couple. I got these two right here, it's probably<br>
   my favorite tattoo, actually. It says—<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Did that hurt a lot? I know that's a stupid question, but I'm just<br>
   very curious.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: [Laughs]. It didn't hurt quite as much as I thought it would, it<br>
   was just more like, &quot;Oh my eyes are really like, tiring,&quot; kind of stuff, so<br>
   that didn't really hurt. I think the worst I've ever had hurt was probably<br>
   right here on the collarbone area. Yeah, that's probably the worst.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: We've heard from a lot of people here tattoos are kind of<br>
   associated with gangs and criminal activity over in the States, and that's<br>
   why a lot of migrants when they come back get profiled. Do you think that's<br>
   true?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I have to tell you, I'm going to guess that's really true. Because<br>
   it's just something really common up there. Either you join something and<br>
   you're known as hardcore, you're known as somebody, or you don't join<br>
   anything and you get bullied around. That's what I could say.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Did you join anyone when you were over there?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Yeah. I got jumped in, 15,16, with a family kind of thing when<br>
   they're out there. That was basically not a really big choice for me. All<br>
   the family was in there, so that's all I could say on that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: How was that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Basically, there's a very big process into it, which is kind of, I<br>
   don’t know. Probably we shouldn't talk about it too much.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What's been the hardest part back in Mexico?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: The hardest part here in Mexico is actually I'm trying to live here<br>
   with the economy that they have. One day transport is cheap, the next day<br>
   it goes up, and then it keeps going up, and you're just like, &quot;Oh.&quot; It's<br>
   just really hard to keep up with it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What have you been up to in this past year and a half that you've<br>
   been here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: This past year I moved in with my girlfriend, so I've been here<br>
   ever since, and we met each other here. So I ended up moving out with her,<br>
   and I'm trying to do my university but it's kind of hard and stuff like<br>
   that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What are you trying to study?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I was actually doing a graphic designs and stuff like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Cool!<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: That was always something I did like. And now in the States I<br>
   actually had an administration, so that was probably one of those two.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Are you currently working or what are you doing?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Yeah, currently I had a cousin that got me to work here at T-Tech,<br>
   so I guess that was it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Do you like T-Tech?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Yeah, it’s a pretty interesting place.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: In what ways?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: It kind of reminds me of the high school out in the States. That's<br>
   basically that's all I can say about it. [Chuckle]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: In what way does it remind you of a high school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: With all the people in there, basically it's a high school. That's<br>
   how high school is out there. It just reminded me exactly like in<br>
   California high school.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: In what ways do you think that being in the U.S. all that time<br>
   shaped who you are?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I think the only way I can put it really is just being strong.<br>
   Because basically you got to learn how to mature in a faster way than you'd<br>
   probably do it here. I've seen a couple of family members or friends here<br>
   that are like 30 years old and they're still living with their dad and mom.<br>
   They're just like not doing anything for their life, and opposed of people<br>
   out there, most of them that I do know were just living by themselves and<br>
   doing their thing. I'd say out there it's probably not that good because<br>
   you’d get, because most of the people would get into some kind of a drug<br>
   addiction or something like that. I’d say, here, here it'd be probably the<br>
   same, but out there it'd be easier to make money. Here it's a lot harder.<br>
   That's probably what's the difference here to there. That's what I'm<br>
   saying, I think out there you learn how to be strong. When you come here,<br>
   you're just like, &quot;Oh.&quot; most people get depressed or frustrated here.<br>
   Others actually know how to move on and continue. That's probably how I see<br>
   it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I've actually always said I consider myself Mexican. American, no,<br>
   I was never that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: If you could have stayed in the U.S., what do you think you might<br>
   have done?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I probably would have finished my university out there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Where were you going to school?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I was studying in the University of Utah, so that was pretty<br>
   interesting.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And now that you're back in Mexico, what do you think you'd like<br>
   to do over here, dreams?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: I just want to finish my university. When I was out in the States I<br>
   would send money out here, so I have a house and stuff like that. I just<br>
   want to just get done with my university and actually, you know, work on<br>
   that. That's pretty much it, all the goals I do have on here. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Well those are pretty much all the questions that I had, but now I<br>
   want to give you a chance if there's anything else that you want to add, or<br>
   anything that you want to tell me that you'd like me to know or anybody<br>
   else who's listening to this, or whatever you want to say.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yosell: Let's see, I like the program that you guys are doing, it's<br>
   actually something very interesting that I haven't really seen around here,<br>
   so that's probably a good thing. And other than that, I think you guys<br>
   pretty much got everything. It's not that much into details, but I think<br>
   you guys got it all.<br>
