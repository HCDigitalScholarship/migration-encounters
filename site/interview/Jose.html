   traffic violation and deported—not deported, I got voluntary leave,<br>
   actually. The only thing I knew is that I didn't want to be locked up like<br>
   an animal for something so small. I'd rather be back in my city as a free<br>
   man and try to earn my right to go back to the States legally and just live<br>
   over there. It wasn't a good thing or a good feeling to be driving around,<br>
   just being anywhere, having a fearing of being detained for any minority. I<br>
   definitely want to go back. It's definitely a beautiful country and I just<br>
   think the circumstances have been very difficult, but I definitely want to<br>
   go back.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Jose: Most of my brothers and sisters... I've actually been working on</br>   papers with DREAMers and my little sister is a citizen, but my sister's</br>   been getting right. One of my brothers is actually detained at the moment,</br>   and my mom's also working on her residency. So, I was actually like the</br>   only one that was in the process of getting any papers and it just so</br>   happened that I was the one to get detained. So now I want to figure out a</br>   way to get back legally because I definitely want to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. I got arrested at the beginning of February and I stayed in an</br>   immigration facility for two months until I was sent over with my voluntary</br>   leave. I was allowed to buy my own ticket. So, I came straight from ____ to</br>   Mexico City and I've been here for about two months. I've been getting all</br>   my paperwork and been looking for a job and I just currently landed a job.</br>   And I'm under training right now, but it seems decent money to be in</br>   Mexico, but it's nothing compared to what I would be making in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, can I go back to when you went to the States. Do you remember</br>   going over when you were eight? Do you remember that?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Actually, I don't remember it being as difficult as people say</br>   it is now. But back then I remember we were driving just on the street. We</br>   could see the border and then you know the river? The bridge? We got out</br>   maybe like a couple of miles before that, went into the bushes. We waited</br>   until nighttime. At nighttime, we went in inflatable rafts. I was on</br>   somebody's back and they crossed us over one by one. Once everybody crossed</br>   over, we ran for a couple of minutes to a Walmart. I remember going inside</br>   the Walmart ‘cause my sister had lost her shoe in the whole running and</br>   they had bought her a shoe. After the Walmart, we were taken to a hotel</br>   safe house and we were actually ditched at the safe house. My dad had to</br>   hire, or pay, for another coyote to go pick us up in Texas—we got stranded</br>   in Texas. Yeah, another whole different coyote had to come and pick us up.</br>   And that coyote delivered us from Texas to ____, where I've been living for</br>   like 16 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you started school. You probably didn't know any</br>   English, right?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And school was tough?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, very.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it tough because of the language?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, the language was a very difficult thing, but I knew I had to</br>   get my act together and learn English as quick as possible. There's a bunch</br>   of classes in the States that teach foreign kids to learn English. Whether</br>   you're from any Latin American country, Asia, or whatever. I remember being</br>   an ESL and I remember being surrounded by Hispanics, Asians, and there was</br>   like a Russian kid.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Russian kid?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Or Slovakian. I don't remember, but I think he was Russian.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you never really warmed up to school?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, I did after a while. After the whole English thing. I was about</br>   two years in and I was able to speak English not perfectly, but well enough</br>   for me to understand what the teachers were telling me and all that. During</br>   middle school, I was actually in advanced classes. The whole advanced</br>   classes thing was when my parents were splitting up and I started acting</br>   out and getting into trouble and stuff. And that's what led me into high</br>   school. Once I got into high school, I was kicked out of all my advanced</br>   classes because I was acting out in my classes before that. Eventually,</br>   through that whole year, it was a big downfall for me. As my parents were</br>   splitting up, I was acting rebellious, trying to get attention.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's tough. Were your other siblings also acting out?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. My sister also acted out. I feel like more than anything, my</br>   younger brother was the one that was traumatized the most. I was like 13</br>   and he was like eight, nine years old when my parents were splitting up and</br>   it was a super drastic change. After they split up, I actually moved to</br>   Cali for a while. As soon as my parents split up, my mom knew that she</br>   wouldn't be able to sustain us so she moved out to Cali. We lived with her</br>   uncle for a while. Yeah, we lived there in Cali for a year. Eventually, I</br>   moved out back to ___ with my dad.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: It wasn't the best move I could have made. That's when I started</br>   freshman year in high school and that was when eventually I got paneled,</br>   got kicked out of school, and... yeah. My mom actually ended up moving back</br>   to _____ and that's when I convinced her to help me drop out of school to</br>   help her financially. It wasn't an idea that thrilled her, but she knew</br>   that eventually at the point where I was at school, I would either end up</br>   being more rebellious and end up getting locked up. So I feel like one of</br>   the best decisions for me was actually to drop out even though it bit me in</br>   the ass in the end. Yeah. I mean, a lot of people, a lot of my friends</br>   ended up joining gangs and getting shot, arrested, and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You never did?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Not for the things they were getting arrested for. I was arrested for</br>   traffic violations and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you never joined a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were in charge of—</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. I mean, I was too busy. I was too busy going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. What did your mom and dad do when they were working? What</br>   kind of work did they do?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: My mom did cleaning most of her life. She still does cleaning.</br>   Housecleaning. She actually maintains a single property now. She's like a</br>   house sitter, I guess. She makes enough money there to support herself, but</br>   at the time, I was making enough money to pay for rent and she was just</br>   helping out with bills. The money she was making, she was able to pay her</br>   car note and paid my little sister's school stuff or whatever. So I was</br>   mainly in charge of paying rent and bills and stuff like that. And now</br>   she’s having a tough time because I'm over here, but there's no way I'm</br>   going back with the way the laws are, theimmigration laws are right now. I</br>   actually want to wait it out after a new presidency. See what happens.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you went for a while to Cali, you got back to ____, and</br>   then your mom followed you eventually. What about your little brother who</br>   you said was really traumatized by the…?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Actually, my brother's in jail right now. Yeah, I feel like he</br>   was the one that was traumatized the most. After he was eight, nine, ten</br>   years old, he was the one that acted out the most. I mean, I'm not sure if</br>   it was to do what I do, to do what the older brother does, or just because</br>   he was doing it by himself. Like I said, as I grew up, I started working. I</br>   started getting my head straight. I was being mentored by older people. I</br>   was working with older people and they were telling me the things I should</br>   be doing instead of splitting into the wrong way. And I was mentored by a</br>   lot of people. People that I still keep in touch with now. Coworkers and</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: So while my brother was going through his stuff, I tried to mentor</br>   him a lot, but it was always... It went in one ear and it came out the</br>   other. I had struggled myself so I understood where he was coming from. And</br>   I felt like I grew up best by learning from my own mistakes and being told</br>   what could happen and then making that mistake and being like I was warned</br>   about this. I warned my brother about everything. I would just... Since</br>   that was the mindset I grew up in, I couldn't really help what he was</br>   doing, but I was going to tell him what could happen down the line. And</br>   eventually, it did. He was getting locked up. He was like 16, 17 being</br>   brought home by the police for doing whatever now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he join a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No, but he was always in the wrong crowd, doing the wrong things.</br>   Actually, about a year ago, he was incarcerated, and he was just convicted</br>   for 12 years. And he's 20 now. Actually, he just turned 21 about a week</br>   ago. And now he has to do 12 years in prison for hanging out with the wrong</br>   crowd. Covering people he shouldn't have been covering.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow. That's sad. Your mom must be really sad.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, she's devastated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Devastated, yeah. And you have a younger sister? Just one?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: I have a younger sister. She's seven.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She lives with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. And my older sister, she's got a whole family now. She lives</br>   with her husband. She's got two kids. She's doing her own thing, but I feel</br>   like eventually my mom's going to have to move in with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they're in ____ too?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does she have DACA? Your sister?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. She finished high school and now that she's got her DREAMers,</br>   whatever—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. And she's actually working on her residency because her</br>   husband's also a citizen so she's getting her stuff together. She's got two</br>   kids. So I mean, she's just getting her paperwork done. She's actually</br>   planning on coming to Mexico maybe. I doubt she'll come to Mexico, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To see you or to... Or both?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Yeah. No, just a visit.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But once she gets her papers maybe?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. My mom is also working on her residency. She's working with a</br>   lawyer. Since my sister's a citizen and she doesn't have any immigration</br>   status, they're going to try to help her get some type of work permit or</br>   something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you're in ninth grade, you convince your mom that you need to</br>   drop out of school and start working and helping her out?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Actually, after I got kicked out, I was still living with my dad. But</br>   I had a lot of issues with my dad. We got into a lot of arguments. So after</br>   I got kicked out of school, he sort of kicked me out of the house and I</br>   ended up living with a buddy and I started working with him. Not with him,</br>   but we started working together and that's when I started making money.</br>   That's when my mom came back to _____, and I was like, “Hey look. I'm</br>   making enough money to help you out with bills and stuff. I feel like this</br>   might be the best situation for right now.” And whether she liked it or</br>   not, she agreed with me and the following year, I came back and I dropped</br>   out officially. And yeah. I started working.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your dad violent?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. He's also an alcoholic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's tough. So, what did you do for work permits and...?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: What do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like when you started working. Did you have a fake social security</br>   card? What did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No. Actually, when I was younger, my uncle claimed me for taxes so I</br>   had a tax ID.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: So, with my tax ID, I was able to work under my name even though I</br>   couldn't claim taxes or even report them, but I was still officially in the</br>   system. So I was still able to cash checks and all that stuff without any</br>   problem. Everything I got was in my name. Some jobs paid me in cash, some</br>   paid me in check. When I first started working, since I was under age, I</br>   couldn't cash any checks so I started working for cash only. And that's</br>   when I was making maybe a hundred bucks a day.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what were you doing?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Different stuff. I started working with this couple that did house</br>   evictions. They maintained houses for banks, bank-owned houses. So we</br>   trimmed the grass, cleaned out the property, whatever. And if a house was</br>   evicted, like a month ago, we had to go and take out everything the house</br>   had in it, take it out to the dump. Just maintain the houses until they</br>   were sold by the bank. Sometimes we did a little bit of touch-ups, paint</br>   and stuff like that. After that job, I started getting into paint. I</br>   started painting for maybe a year. And paint was really bad hours and</br>   really low pay so I started looking for other stuff. Eventually, I did</br>   tile. I did flooring.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: And eventually I started working in framing, where is where I got the</br>   most money. I think I started with like 80 bucks, but I was only throwing</br>   trash. I was only picking up scraps, throwing trash, and it was a pretty</br>   easy job for like 80 bucks. But then I started getting to know the job and</br>   they started teaching me stuff and I started making like 120, 140 in a day.</br>   So, then I started liking it. I started putting more effort into learning</br>   and get a higher position in the job. And I started working until I was a</br>   master and I was the one... Actually, before I came, I was a group manager</br>   and since I spoke good English, I was able to talk with the builders and</br>   since I knew the work and stuff, I started making pretty good money. My</br>   employer at the moment his English wasn't that good, so I put him onto a</br>   lot of people. I helped him with work and with managing his business. Yeah,</br>   that's where I started making like 20, 20 plus. I was also getting bonuses.</br>   After a house was done, I would get a little bonus for helping out extra.</br>   Yeah, I started making really good money there. That's when we really came</br>   up. We used to live in really cheap apartments until we moved up and</br>   started living really good. But then this happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what's this?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: A transition in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: A transition in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So how did you end up back here?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: I was driving. It was like a Sunday, no a Saturday. I was with my</br>   sister and a buddy and his kids. We had gone to McDonald's and I was</br>   driving back home and I was going like five miles over the speed limit and</br>   I was pulled over for speeding. Because I didn't have a license, I was</br>   taken to county jail. At county jail, immigration got ahold on me and</br>   that's when I went to the immigration detention center and that's where I</br>   was given my choice of either fighting my case or just leaving voluntarily.</br>   And I just thought it was the best idea to leave voluntarily and try to</br>   come back legally. There was a couple of options I could've taken. I</br>   could've fought my case, but in most cases, it was like a five percent</br>   chance of winning. It really depended on the judge. I didn't think I was</br>   going to win. Most of the reason people win is because they have property,</br>   have kids. They have a reason to be there. I didn't have kids. Even though</br>   I was a main supplier at the house, main supporter, it didn't matter to the</br>   judge's eye. So he gave me the voluntary leave and I took it. Thought it</br>   was my best option.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said they pulled you over for speeding and saw you didn't have</br>   a license. And did you say they already had a hold on you for ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, no, as soon as the county takes you to the county jail... That</br>   county alone is actually known to work with immigration. So they have an</br>   immigration office within that county jail. So, I mean, as soon as you step</br>   in, they... An hour in, they fingerprint you, whatever, they bring you out</br>   to ICE interview, and at the ICE interview, they directly tell you that you</br>   have a hold on immigration. There is no point in paying your bond or bail,</br>   whatever. You're detained by ICE.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that was the only thing you ever did wrong? Or you ever got caught</br>   doing wrong?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No, actually, I had a verbal offense with an officer, which I fought,</br>   and I cleaned. It was like a misdemeanor. But other than that, I was also</br>   arrested once prior to that for no license, but at that time immigration</br>   laws weren't that strict. I was in county jail for like maybe two hours.</br>   They just fingerprinted me. And they were like, &quot;Oh, they paid your bail.</br>   You're good.&quot; I was out. I just went to court, paid my fine, and that was</br>   it. That was all I ever heard of that. Actually, when I got arrested that</br>   second time, when I got deported, I didn't even worry at all until I was at</br>   immigration. I mean, I got arrested and everything. I didn't worry about</br>   it. Even though at the time I was with my little sister when I got</br>   arrested, I called my sister to tell her to come pick up the kid. My</br>   brother-in-law came to pick up the car. They took the car and everything.</br>   And we're fine. They're like, &quot;Oh, we'll just see you at the county jail.</br>   It'll be fine.&quot; But we were dead wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what did you like best about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Everything. The culture. I really like how there's a bunch of</br>   different cultures. Whether or not everybody mingles together, there's so</br>   many cultures for me to learn and see. Food. The freedom. The fact that you</br>   don't really have to worry about the things you have to worry about here.</br>   Here, you can't even be walking at night. You have to be looking around the</br>   corner because you never know. There's probably like a 50% chance if you're</br>   walking out a night, you're probably going to get robbed. And in the</br>   States, it wasn't ever like that. I remember being 14, 15 walking home from</br>   a buddy's house at 10 and nothing you know? The security. I felt secure.</br>   And my friends, honestly. Also, the currency. Currency was like a really...</br>   How do I say this? It's pretty easy for people to make money in the States,</br>   you know. And you don't really need to have a really good job to supply</br>   enough for your house. And even people in low income still have enough to</br>   survive. And here in Mexico, you got to really hustle really hard to even</br>   survive. So that was the thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So do you think being in the US changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Different outlook on life, different—?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. I was definitely humbled by knowing where I come from and</br>   knowing that at any moment everything could be taken away. In a lot of</br>   ways. I can't really tell you because I haven't lived here long enough to</br>   know the difference, but yeah. Definitely.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="4438c430-c9ab-4474-9e63-9a75de0f0e8b" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Anne: What were your dreams before you were deported?<br>

 <br>
 <br>

   impressions?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jose: Okay. I was eight and I went with my older sister, my younger<br>
   brother, and my mom to reunite with my dad. My dad had been in the States<br>
   for two or three years. We went back because my dad saw a potential for<br>
   better life in the States and he saved up enough money to bring us out.</span> And</br>   we did. As I started, I had trouble at school and, in ninth grade, I</br>   dropped out. Around that time, my mom and my dad split up and my mom</br>   couldn't financially sustain us. So, after I dropped out, I helped my mom</br>   financially and I've been helping her ever since. I've been working for</br>   seven years. I also got a new little sister in the States. A younger sister</br>   now. So now I have two sisters and an older brother. Yeah, I've lived in</br>   the States for 16 years and I like it there, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: It was kind of a drastic change when I was incarcerated for a mere</br>   traffic violation and deported—not deported, I got voluntary leave,</br>   actually. The only thing I knew is that I didn't want to be locked up like</br>   an animal for something so small. I'd rather be back in my city as a free</br>   man and try to earn my right to go back to the States legally and just live</br>   over there. It wasn't a good thing or a good feeling to be driving around,</br>   just being anywhere, having a fearing of being detained for any minority. I</br>   definitely want to go back. It's definitely a beautiful country and I just</br>   think the circumstances have been very difficult, but I definitely want to</br>   go back.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Most of my brothers and sisters... I've actually been working on</br>   papers with DREAMers and my little sister is a citizen, but my sister's</br>   been getting right. One of my brothers is actually detained at the moment,</br>   and my mom's also working on her residency. So, I was actually like the</br>   only one that was in the process of getting any papers and it just so</br>   happened that I was the one to get detained. So now I want to figure out a</br>   way to get back legally because I definitely want to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. I got arrested at the beginning of February and I stayed in an</br>   immigration facility for two months until I was sent over with my voluntary</br>   leave. I was allowed to buy my own ticket. So, I came straight from ____ to</br>   Mexico City and I've been here for about two months. I've been getting all</br>   my paperwork and been looking for a job and I just currently landed a job.</br>   And I'm under training right now, but it seems decent money to be in</br>   Mexico, but it's nothing compared to what I would be making in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, can I go back to when you went to the States. Do you remember</br>   going over when you were eight? Do you remember that?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Actually, I don't remember it being as difficult as people say</br>   it is now. But back then I remember we were driving just on the street. We</br>   could see the border and then you know the river? The bridge? We got out</br>   maybe like a couple of miles before that, went into the bushes. We waited</br>   until nighttime. At nighttime, we went in inflatable rafts. I was on</br>   somebody's back and they crossed us over one by one. Once everybody crossed</br>   over, we ran for a couple of minutes to a Walmart. I remember going inside</br>   the Walmart ‘cause my sister had lost her shoe in the whole running and</br>   they had bought her a shoe. After the Walmart, we were taken to a hotel</br>   safe house and we were actually ditched at the safe house. My dad had to</br>   hire, or pay, for another coyote to go pick us up in Texas—we got stranded</br>   in Texas. Yeah, another whole different coyote had to come and pick us up.</br>   And that coyote delivered us from Texas to ____, where I've been living for</br>   like 16 years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you started school. You probably didn't know any</br>   English, right?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And school was tough?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, very.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it tough because of the language?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, the language was a very difficult thing, but I knew I had to</br>   get my act together and learn English as quick as possible. There's a bunch</br>   of classes in the States that teach foreign kids to learn English. Whether</br>   you're from any Latin American country, Asia, or whatever. I remember being</br>   an ESL and I remember being surrounded by Hispanics, Asians, and there was</br>   like a Russian kid.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Russian kid?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Or Slovakian. I don't remember, but I think he was Russian.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you never really warmed up to school?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, I did after a while. After the whole English thing. I was about</br>   two years in and I was able to speak English not perfectly, but well enough</br>   for me to understand what the teachers were telling me and all that. During</br>   middle school, I was actually in advanced classes. The whole advanced</br>   classes thing was when my parents were splitting up and I started acting</br>   out and getting into trouble and stuff. And that's what led me into high</br>   school. Once I got into high school, I was kicked out of all my advanced</br>   classes because I was acting out in my classes before that. Eventually,</br>   through that whole year, it was a big downfall for me. As my parents were</br>   splitting up, I was acting rebellious, trying to get attention.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's tough. Were your other siblings also acting out?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. My sister also acted out. I feel like more than anything, my</br>   younger brother was the one that was traumatized the most. I was like 13</br>   and he was like eight, nine years old when my parents were splitting up and</br>   it was a super drastic change. After they split up, I actually moved to</br>   Cali for a while. As soon as my parents split up, my mom knew that she</br>   wouldn't be able to sustain us so she moved out to Cali. We lived with her</br>   uncle for a while. Yeah, we lived there in Cali for a year. Eventually, I</br>   moved out back to ___ with my dad.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: It wasn't the best move I could have made. That's when I started</br>   freshman year in high school and that was when eventually I got paneled,</br>   got kicked out of school, and... yeah. My mom actually ended up moving back</br>   to _____ and that's when I convinced her to help me drop out of school to</br>   help her financially. It wasn't an idea that thrilled her, but she knew</br>   that eventually at the point where I was at school, I would either end up</br>   being more rebellious and end up getting locked up. So I feel like one of</br>   the best decisions for me was actually to drop out even though it bit me in</br>   the ass in the end. Yeah. I mean, a lot of people, a lot of my friends</br>   ended up joining gangs and getting shot, arrested, and all that stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You never did?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Not for the things they were getting arrested for. I was arrested for</br>   traffic violations and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you never joined a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were in charge of—</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. I mean, I was too busy. I was too busy going to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. What did your mom and dad do when they were working? What</br>   kind of work did they do?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: My mom did cleaning most of her life. She still does cleaning.</br>   Housecleaning. She actually maintains a single property now. She's like a</br>   house sitter, I guess. She makes enough money there to support herself, but</br>   at the time, I was making enough money to pay for rent and she was just</br>   helping out with bills. The money she was making, she was able to pay her</br>   car note and paid my little sister's school stuff or whatever. So I was</br>   mainly in charge of paying rent and bills and stuff like that. And now</br>   she’s having a tough time because I'm over here, but there's no way I'm</br>   going back with the way the laws are, theimmigration laws are right now. I</br>   actually want to wait it out after a new presidency. See what happens.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you said you went for a while to Cali, you got back to ____, and</br>   then your mom followed you eventually. What about your little brother who</br>   you said was really traumatized by the…?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Actually, my brother's in jail right now. Yeah, I feel like he</br>   was the one that was traumatized the most. After he was eight, nine, ten</br>   years old, he was the one that acted out the most. I mean, I'm not sure if</br>   it was to do what I do, to do what the older brother does, or just because</br>   he was doing it by himself. Like I said, as I grew up, I started working. I</br>   started getting my head straight. I was being mentored by older people. I</br>   was working with older people and they were telling me the things I should</br>   be doing instead of splitting into the wrong way. And I was mentored by a</br>   lot of people. People that I still keep in touch with now. Coworkers and</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: So while my brother was going through his stuff, I tried to mentor</br>   him a lot, but it was always... It went in one ear and it came out the</br>   other. I had struggled myself so I understood where he was coming from. And</br>   I felt like I grew up best by learning from my own mistakes and being told</br>   what could happen and then making that mistake and being like I was warned</br>   about this. I warned my brother about everything. I would just... Since</br>   that was the mindset I grew up in, I couldn't really help what he was</br>   doing, but I was going to tell him what could happen down the line. And</br>   eventually, it did. He was getting locked up. He was like 16, 17 being</br>   brought home by the police for doing whatever now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he join a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No, but he was always in the wrong crowd, doing the wrong things.</br>   Actually, about a year ago, he was incarcerated, and he was just convicted</br>   for 12 years. And he's 20 now. Actually, he just turned 21 about a week</br>   ago. And now he has to do 12 years in prison for hanging out with the wrong</br>   crowd. Covering people he shouldn't have been covering.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow. That's sad. Your mom must be really sad.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, she's devastated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Devastated, yeah. And you have a younger sister? Just one?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: I have a younger sister. She's seven.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She lives with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. And my older sister, she's got a whole family now. She lives</br>   with her husband. She's got two kids. She's doing her own thing, but I feel</br>   like eventually my mom's going to have to move in with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they're in ____ too?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does she have DACA? Your sister?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. She finished high school and now that she's got her DREAMers,</br>   whatever—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. And she's actually working on her residency because her</br>   husband's also a citizen so she's getting her stuff together. She's got two</br>   kids. So I mean, she's just getting her paperwork done. She's actually</br>   planning on coming to Mexico maybe. I doubt she'll come to Mexico, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To see you or to... Or both?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Yeah. No, just a visit.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But once she gets her papers maybe?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. My mom is also working on her residency. She's working with a</br>   lawyer. Since my sister's a citizen and she doesn't have any immigration</br>   status, they're going to try to help her get some type of work permit or</br>   something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you're in ninth grade, you convince your mom that you need to</br>   drop out of school and start working and helping her out?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="a0492578-249a-411b-b954-e46b6667f3fc" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Family, Rejection, Parents/step-parents, Arguments/Estrangement, Arguments/Estrangement, School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out">Jose: Actually, after I got kicked out, I was still living with my dad. But<br>
   I had a lot of issues with my dad. We got into a lot of arguments. So after<br>
   I got kicked out of school, he sort of kicked me out of the house and I<br>
   ended up living with a buddy and I started working with him. Not with him,<br>
   but we started working together and that's when I started making money.<br>
   That's when my mom came back to _____, and I was like, “Hey look. I'm<br>
   making enough money to help you out with bills and stuff. I feel like this<br>
   might be the best situation for right now.” And whether she liked it or<br>
   not, she agreed with me and the following year, I came back and I dropped<br>
   out officially. And yeah. I started working.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anne: Is your dad violent?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. He's also an alcoholic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's tough. So, what did you do for work permits and...?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: What do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like when you started working. Did you have a fake social security</br>   card? What did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No. Actually, when I was younger, my uncle claimed me for taxes so I</br>   had a tax ID.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: So, with my tax ID, I was able to work under my name even though I</br>   couldn't claim taxes or even report them, but I was still officially in the</br>   system. So I was still able to cash checks and all that stuff without any</br>   problem. Everything I got was in my name. Some jobs paid me in cash, some</br>   paid me in check. When I first started working, since I was under age, I</br>   couldn't cash any checks so I started working for cash only. And that's</br>   when I was making maybe a hundred bucks a day.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what were you doing?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Different stuff. I started working with this couple that did house</br>   evictions. They maintained houses for banks, bank-owned houses. So we</br>   trimmed the grass, cleaned out the property, whatever. And if a house was</br>   evicted, like a month ago, we had to go and take out everything the house</br>   had in it, take it out to the dump. Just maintain the houses until they</br>   were sold by the bank. Sometimes we did a little bit of touch-ups, paint</br>   and stuff like that. After that job, I started getting into paint. I</br>   started painting for maybe a year. And paint was really bad hours and</br>   really low pay so I started looking for other stuff. Eventually, I did</br>   tile. I did flooring.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: And eventually I started working in framing, where is where I got the</br>   most money. I think I started with like 80 bucks, but I was only throwing</br>   trash. I was only picking up scraps, throwing trash, and it was a pretty</br>   easy job for like 80 bucks. But then I started getting to know the job and</br>   they started teaching me stuff and I started making like 120, 140 in a day.</br>   So, then I started liking it. I started putting more effort into learning</br>   and get a higher position in the job. And I started working until I was a</br>   master and I was the one... Actually, before I came, I was a group manager</br>   and since I spoke good English, I was able to talk with the builders and</br>   since I knew the work and stuff, I started making pretty good money. My</br>   employer at the moment his English wasn't that good, so I put him onto a</br>   lot of people. I helped him with work and with managing his business. Yeah,</br>   that's where I started making like 20, 20 plus. I was also getting bonuses.</br>   After a house was done, I would get a little bonus for helping out extra.</br>   Yeah, I started making really good money there. That's when we really came</br>   up. We used to live in really cheap apartments until we moved up and</br>   started living really good. But then this happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what's this?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: A transition in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: A transition in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So how did you end up back here?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: I was driving. It was like a Sunday, no a Saturday. I was with my</br>   sister and a buddy and his kids. We had gone to McDonald's and I was</br>   driving back home and I was going like five miles over the speed limit and</br>   I was pulled over for speeding. Because I didn't have a license, I was</br>   taken to county jail. At county jail, immigration got ahold on me and</br>   that's when I went to the immigration detention center and that's where I</br>   was given my choice of either fighting my case or just leaving voluntarily.</br>   And I just thought it was the best idea to leave voluntarily and try to</br>   come back legally. There was a couple of options I could've taken. I</br>   could've fought my case, but in most cases, it was like a five percent</br>   chance of winning. It really depended on the judge. I didn't think I was</br>   going to win. Most of the reason people win is because they have property,</br>   have kids. They have a reason to be there. I didn't have kids. Even though</br>   I was a main supplier at the house, main supporter, it didn't matter to the</br>   judge's eye. So he gave me the voluntary leave and I took it. Thought it</br>   was my best option.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said they pulled you over for speeding and saw you didn't have</br>   a license. And did you say they already had a hold on you for ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, no, as soon as the county takes you to the county jail... That</br>   county alone is actually known to work with immigration. So they have an</br>   immigration office within that county jail. So, I mean, as soon as you step</br>   in, they... An hour in, they fingerprint you, whatever, they bring you out</br>   to ICE interview, and at the ICE interview, they directly tell you that you</br>   have a hold on immigration. There is no point in paying your bond or bail,</br>   whatever. You're detained by ICE.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that was the only thing you ever did wrong? Or you ever got caught</br>   doing wrong?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No, actually, I had a verbal offense with an officer, which I fought,</br>   and I cleaned. It was like a misdemeanor. But other than that, I was also</br>   arrested once prior to that for no license, but at that time immigration</br>   laws weren't that strict. I was in county jail for like maybe two hours.</br>   They just fingerprinted me. And they were like, &quot;Oh, they paid your bail.</br>   You're good.&quot; I was out. I just went to court, paid my fine, and that was</br>   it. That was all I ever heard of that. Actually, when I got arrested that</br>   second time, when I got deported, I didn't even worry at all until I was at</br>   immigration. I mean, I got arrested and everything. I didn't worry about</br>   it. Even though at the time I was with my little sister when I got</br>   arrested, I called my sister to tell her to come pick up the kid. My</br>   brother-in-law came to pick up the car. They took the car and everything.</br>   And we're fine. They're like, &quot;Oh, we'll just see you at the county jail.</br>   It'll be fine.&quot; But we were dead wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what did you like best about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Everything. The culture. I really like how there's a bunch of</br>   different cultures. Whether or not everybody mingles together, there's so</br>   many cultures for me to learn and see. Food. The freedom. The fact that you</br>   don't really have to worry about the things you have to worry about here.</br>   Here, you can't even be walking at night. You have to be looking around the</br>   corner because you never know. There's probably like a 50% chance if you're</br>   walking out a night, you're probably going to get robbed. And in the</br>   States, it wasn't ever like that. I remember being 14, 15 walking home from</br>   a buddy's house at 10 and nothing you know? The security. I felt secure.</br>   And my friends, honestly. Also, the currency. Currency was like a really...</br>   How do I say this? It's pretty easy for people to make money in the States,</br>   you know. And you don't really need to have a really good job to supply</br>   enough for your house. And even people in low income still have enough to</br>   survive. And here in Mexico, you got to really hustle really hard to even</br>   survive. So that was the thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So do you think being in the US changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Different outlook on life, different—?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. I was definitely humbled by knowing where I come from and</br>   knowing that at any moment everything could be taken away. In a lot of</br>   ways. I can't really tell you because I haven't lived here long enough to</br>   know the difference, but yeah. Definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What were your dreams before you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Buy my little sister a house. Buying a house. It's still my dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where will that house be?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: In ___. I'm definitely going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You liked ____?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. It's not really the city that I like. It's the people that</br>   lived within it. My friends and my family and the relationships I had with</br>   coworkers and stuff. The reason I would go back is not for the city itself</br>   but for the people that are there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you came back here, you basically left your whole family. Do</br>   you have uncles, aunts, grandparents here? How did that work?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Now, here, I currently live with my grandma and my aunt at my</br>   grandma's house. But yeah, in the States, I lived with my mother.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you remember your grandma and your aunt?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, actually, my grandma is a US citizen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, she is?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Or resident. Yeah, I think she's a resident.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But she lives here?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, but she lives here. But she goes to the States probably like</br>   once a year. She visits us once a year. Stays in the summer. Mainly in the</br>   summer because she takes care of my little sister like in summer breaks and</br>   stuff. But she stays there maybe a month. Also, I have a lot of family in</br>   California. So during the summer, my grandma leaves and she goes to Cali</br>   and she goes to ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that's nice that you knew her when you came back. Someone to live</br>   with that—</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take you to get a job?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: About a month. And that's just because I've been waiting. I came to</br>   apply at T-Tech down the street and, at the current time, they were having</br>   schedule changes and stuff. Told me to come back at a different date. And</br>   as soon as I came back for the interview, I got hired. Saw the contract and</br>   everything and I'd just been waiting for start. It was like two weeks. So</br>   it was like two week wait for the interview, then a two week wait for the</br>   start. But actually this is my second day.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was it?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: It was good. Straining. It feels like going to school. A lot of</br>   goofing around.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A lot of people similar to you?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. A lot of people will tell you their stories in there. First</br>   couple of days everybody shared their stories. Telling where in the States</br>   they lived, if they had been deported, where they live. Some of these</br>   people were not even deported themselves. A lot of them, it was their</br>   parents got deported so they have to follow. A lot of people came willingly</br>   for some reason. Actually, our trainer is a resident. She goes to Cali back</br>   and forth and she says that she actually enjoys living in Mexico City more</br>   than in Cali. So, like, if I had to choose to stay and live in one city, it</br>   would be Mexico City. And honestly, it's not bad. Best place to live in</br>   Mexico is probably Mexico City. Definitely. I mean, it's got its dark</br>   moments, but it's a nice city. A lot of culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. A lot of culture. Someone told me more museums per capita than</br>   anywhere else in the world. Well, we're getting towards the end of this</br>   interview. So, people are going to listen to your story. Is there anything</br>   you'd like to share with them that you haven't shared thus far about your</br>   experiences in the US? About immigration policy? About anything?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="793e21a8-04cb-40e9-99fb-db77c5f8b3e1" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Racism, Xenophobia, Worst parts">Jose: No, I just feel that more people need to be more aware of the reasons<br>
   people are in the States. A lot of people think they're just there to take<br>
   their jobs, but it's not. People just want a better life. People just want<br>
   to be part of something. I feel the States is probably one of the best<br>
   countries in the world and it will be for the future because it's a<br>
   culmination of so many countries and so many cultures. You take every other<br>
   culture away, what's there really in the States? Everybody in the States<br>
   was an immigrant at some point and people forget that. A lot of citizens<br>
   that are racist towards immigrants forget that their grandparents at some<br>
   point immigrated from another country for the same reasons they did. I just<br>
   want people to remember that America is a country of immigrants.<br>

   and I cleaned. It was like a misdemeanor. But other than that, I was also<br>
   arrested once prior to that for no license, but at that time immigration<br>
   laws weren't that strict. I was in county jail for like maybe two hours.<br>
   They just fingerprinted me. And they were like, &quot;Oh, they paid your bail.<br>
   You're good.&quot; I was out. I just went to court, paid my fine, and that was<br>
   it. That was all I ever heard of that. Actually, when I got arrested that<br>
   second time, when I got deported, I didn't even worry at all until I was at<br>
   immigration. I mean, I got arrested and everything. I didn't worry about<br>
   it. Even though at the time I was with my little sister when I got<br>
   arrested, I called my sister to tell her to come pick up the kid. My<br>
   brother-in-law came to pick up the car. They took the car and everything.<br>
   And we're fine. They're like, &quot;Oh, we'll just see you at the county jail.<br>

   sister and a buddy and his kids. We had gone to McDonald's and I was<br>
   driving back home and I was going like five miles over the speed limit and<br>
   I was pulled over for speeding. Because I didn't have a license, I was<br>
   taken to county jail. At county jail, immigration got ahold on me and<br>
   that's when I went to the immigration detention center and that's where I<br>
   was given my choice of either fighting my case or just leaving voluntarily.<br>
   And I just thought it was the best idea to leave voluntarily and try to<br>
   come back legally. There was a couple of options I could've taken. I<br>
   could've fought my case, but in most cases, it was like a five percent<br>
   chance of winning. It really depended on the judge. I didn't think I was<br>
   going to win. Most of the reason people win is because they have property,<br>
   have kids. They have a reason to be there. I didn't have kids. Even though<br>
   I was a main supplier at the house, main supporter, it didn't matter to the<br>
   judge's eye. So he gave me the voluntary leave and I took it. Thought it<br>
   was my best option.<br>

   evictions. They maintained houses for banks, bank-owned houses. So we<br>
   trimmed the grass, cleaned out the property, whatever. And if a house was<br>
   evicted, like a month ago, we had to go and take out everything the house<br>
   had in it, take it out to the dump. Just maintain the houses until they<br>
   were sold by the bank. Sometimes we did a little bit of touch-ups, paint<br>
   and stuff like that. After that job, I started getting into paint. I<br>
   started painting for maybe a year. And paint was really bad hours and<br>
   really low pay so I started looking for other stuff. Eventually, I did<br>
   tile. I did flooring.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jose: And eventually I started working in framing, where is where I got the<br>
   most money. I think I started with like 80 bucks, but I was only throwing<br>
   trash. I was only picking up scraps, throwing trash, and it was a pretty<br>
   easy job for like 80 bucks. But then I started getting to know the job and<br>
   they started teaching me stuff and I started making like 120, 140 in a day.<br>
   So, then I started liking it. I started putting more effort into learning<br>
   and get a higher position in the job. And I started working until I was a<br>
   master and I was the one... Actually, before I came, I was a group manager<br>
   and since I spoke good English, I was able to talk with the builders and<br>
   since I knew the work and stuff, I started making pretty good money. My<br>
   employer at the moment his English wasn't that good, so I put him onto a<br>
   lot of people. I helped him with work and with managing his business. Yeah,<br>
   that's where I started making like 20, 20 plus. I was also getting bonuses.<br>
   After a house was done, I would get a little bonus for helping out extra.<br>
   Yeah, I started making really good money there. That's when we really came<br>
   up. We used to live in really cheap apartments until we moved up and<br>
   started living really good. But then this happened.<br>

   was the one that was traumatized the most. After he was eight, nine, ten<br>
   years old, he was the one that acted out the most. I mean, I'm not sure if<br>
   it was to do what I do, to do what the older brother does, or just because<br>
   he was doing it by himself. Like I said, as I grew up, I started working. I<br>
   started getting my head straight. I was being mentored by older people. I<br>
   was working with older people and they were telling me the things I should<br>
   be doing instead of splitting into the wrong way. And I was mentored by a<br>
   lot of people. People that I still keep in touch with now. Coworkers and<br>
   stuff.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Jose: So while my brother was going through his stuff, I tried to mentor<br>
   him a lot, but it was always... It went in one ear and it came out the<br>
   other. I had struggled myself so I understood where he was coming from. And<br>
   I felt like I grew up best by learning from my own mistakes and being told<br>
   what could happen and then making that mistake and being like I was warned<br>
   about this. I warned my brother about everything. I would just... Since<br>
   that was the mindset I grew up in, I couldn't really help what he was<br>
   doing, but I was going to tell him what could happen down the line. And<br>
   eventually, it did. He was getting locked up. He was like 16, 17 being<br>
   brought home by the police for doing whatever now.<br>

   at the time, I was making enough money to pay for rent and she was just<br>
   helping out with bills. The money she was making, she was able to pay her<br>

   it was a super drastic change. After they split up, I actually moved to<br>

   maybe like a couple of miles before that, went into the bushes. We waited<br>
   until nighttime. At nighttime, we went in inflatable rafts. I was on<br>
   somebody's back and they crossed us over one by one. Once everybody crossed<br>
   over, we ran for a couple of minutes to a Walmart. I remember going inside<br>
   the Walmart ‘cause my sister had lost her shoe in the whole running and<br>
   they had bought her a shoe. After the Walmart, we were taken to a hotel<br>
   safe house and we were actually ditched at the safe house. My dad had to<br>
   hire, or pay, for another coyote to go pick us up in Texas—we got stranded<br>

Yeah, I feel like he</br>   was the one that was traumatized the most. After he was eight, nine, ten</br>   years old, he was the one that acted out the most. I mean, I'm not sure if</br>   it was to do what I do, to do what the older brother does, or just because</br>   he was doing it by himself. Like I said, as I grew up, I started working.

I</br>   was working with older people and they were telling me the things I should</br>   be doing instead of splitting into the wrong way. And I was mentored by a</br>   lot of people. People that I still keep in touch with now. Coworkers and</br>   stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: So while my brother was going through his stuff, I tried to mentor</br>   him a lot, but it was always... It went in one ear and it came out the</br>   other. I had struggled myself so I understood where he was coming from. And</br>   I felt like I grew up best by learning from my own mistakes and being told</br>   what could happen and then making that mistake and being like I was warned</br>   about this. I warned my brother about everything. I would just... Since</br>   that was the mindset I grew up in, I couldn't really help what he was</br>   doing, but I was going to tell him what could happen down the line. And</br>   eventually, it did. He was getting locked up. He was like 16, 17 being</br>   brought home by the police for doing whatever now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he join a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No, but he was always in the wrong crowd, doing the wrong things.</br>   Actually, about a year ago, he was incarcerated, and he was just convicted</br>   for 12 years. And he's 20 now. Actually, he just turned 21 about a week</br>   ago. And now he has to do 12 years in prison for hanging out with the wrong</br>   crowd. Covering people he shouldn't have been covering.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow. That's sad. Your mom must be really sad.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, she's devastated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Devastated, yeah. And you have a younger sister? Just one?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: I have a younger sister. She's seven.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She lives with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. And my older sister, she's got a whole family now. She lives</br>   with her husband. She's got two kids. She's doing her own thing, but I feel</br>   like eventually my mom's going to have to move in with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they're in ____ too?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does she have DACA? Your sister?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. She finished high school and now that she's got her DREAMers,</br>   whatever—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. And she's actually working on her residency because her</br>   husband's also a citizen so she's getting her stuff together. She's got two</br>   kids. So I mean, she's just getting her paperwork done. She's actually</br>   planning on coming to Mexico maybe. I doubt she'll come to Mexico, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To see you or to... Or both?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. Yeah. No, just a visit.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But once she gets her papers maybe?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. My mom is also working on her residency. She's working with a</br>   lawyer. Since my sister's a citizen and she doesn't have any immigration</br>   status, they're going to try to help her get some type of work permit or</br>   something.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you're in ninth grade, you convince your mom that you need to</br>   drop out of school and start working and helping her out?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Actually, after I got kicked out, I was still living with my dad. But</br>   I had a lot of issues with my dad. We got into a lot of arguments. So after</br>   I got kicked out of school, he sort of kicked me out of the house and I</br>   ended up living with a buddy and I started working with him. Not with him,</br>   but we started working together and that's when I started making money.</br>   That's when my mom came back to _____, and I was like, “Hey look. I'm</br>   making enough money to help you out with bills and stuff. I feel like this</br>   might be the best situation for right now.” And whether she liked it or</br>   not, she agreed with me and the following year, I came back and I dropped</br>   out officially. And yeah. I started working.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your dad violent?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. He's also an alcoholic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's tough. So, what did you do for work permits and...?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: What do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like when you started working. Did you have a fake social security</br>   card? What did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No. Actually, when I was younger, my uncle claimed me for taxes so I</br>   had a tax ID.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: So, with my tax ID, I was able to work under my name even though I</br>   couldn't claim taxes or even report them, but I was still officially in the</br>   system. So I was still able to cash checks and all that stuff without any</br>   problem. Everything I got was in my name. Some jobs paid me in cash, some</br>   paid me in check. When I first started working, since I was under age, I</br>   couldn't cash any checks so I started working for cash only. And that's</br>   when I was making maybe a hundred bucks a day.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what were you doing?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Different stuff. I started working with this couple that did house</br>   evictions. They maintained houses for banks, bank-owned houses. So we</br>   trimmed the grass, cleaned out the property, whatever. And if a house was</br>   evicted, like a month ago, we had to go and take out everything the house</br>   had in it, take it out to the dump. Just maintain the houses until they</br>   were sold by the bank. Sometimes we did a little bit of touch-ups, paint</br>   and stuff like that. After that job, I started getting into paint. I</br>   started painting for maybe a year. And paint was really bad hours and</br>   really low pay so I started looking for other stuff. Eventually, I did</br>   tile. I did flooring.</br> </br> </br>   Jose: And eventually I started working in framing, where is where I got the</br>   most money. I think I started with like 80 bucks, but I was only throwing</br>   trash. I was only picking up scraps, throwing trash, and it was a pretty</br>   easy job for like 80 bucks. But then I started getting to know the job and</br>   they started teaching me stuff and I started making like 120, 140 in a day.</br>   So, then I started liking it. I started putting more effort into learning</br>   and get a higher position in the job. And I started working until I was a</br>   master and I was the one... Actually, before I came, I was a group manager</br>   and since I spoke good English, I was able to talk with the builders and</br>   since I knew the work and stuff, I started making pretty good money. My</br>   employer at the moment his English wasn't that good, so I put him onto a</br>   lot of people. I helped him with work and with managing his business. Yeah,</br>   that's where I started making like 20, 20 plus. I was also getting bonuses.</br>   After a house was done, I would get a little bonus for helping out extra.</br>   Yeah, I started making really good money there. That's when we really came</br>   up. We used to live in really cheap apartments until we moved up and</br>   started living really good. But then this happened.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what's this?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: A transition in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: A transition in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So how did you end up back here?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: I was driving. It was like a Sunday, no a Saturday. I was with my</br>   sister and a buddy and his kids. We had gone to McDonald's and I was</br>   driving back home and I was going like five miles over the speed limit and</br>   I was pulled over for speeding. Because I didn't have a license, I was</br>   taken to county jail. At county jail, immigration got ahold on me and</br>   that's when I went to the immigration detention center and that's where I</br>   was given my choice of either fighting my case or just leaving voluntarily.</br>   And I just thought it was the best idea to leave voluntarily and try to</br>   come back legally. There was a couple of options I could've taken. I</br>   could've fought my case, but in most cases, it was like a five percent</br>   chance of winning. It really depended on the judge. I didn't think I was</br>   going to win. Most of the reason people win is because they have property,</br>   have kids. They have a reason to be there. I didn't have kids. Even though</br>   I was a main supplier at the house, main supporter, it didn't matter to the</br>   judge's eye. So he gave me the voluntary leave and I took it. Thought it</br>   was my best option.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said they pulled you over for speeding and saw you didn't have</br>   a license. And did you say they already had a hold on you for ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, no, as soon as the county takes you to the county jail... That</br>   county alone is actually known to work with immigration. So they have an</br>   immigration office within that county jail. So, I mean, as soon as you step</br>   in, they... An hour in, they fingerprint you, whatever, they bring you out</br>   to ICE interview, and at the ICE interview, they directly tell you that you</br>   have a hold on immigration. There is no point in paying your bond or bail,</br>   whatever. You're detained by ICE.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that was the only thing you ever did wrong? Or you ever got caught</br>   doing wrong?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No, actually, I had a verbal offense with an officer, which I fought,</br>   and I cleaned. It was like a misdemeanor. But other than that, I was also</br>   arrested once prior to that for no license, but at that time immigration</br>   laws weren't that strict. I was in county jail for like maybe two hours.</br>   They just fingerprinted me. And they were like, &quot;Oh, they paid your bail.</br>   You're good.&quot; I was out. I just went to court, paid my fine, and that was</br>   it. That was all I ever heard of that. Actually, when I got arrested that</br>   second time, when I got deported, I didn't even worry at all until I was at</br>   immigration. I mean, I got arrested and everything. I didn't worry about</br>   it. Even though at the time I was with my little sister when I got</br>   arrested, I called my sister to tell her to come pick up the kid. My</br>   brother-in-law came to pick up the car. They took the car and everything.</br>   And we're fine. They're like, &quot;Oh, we'll just see you at the county jail.</br>   It'll be fine.&quot; But we were dead wrong.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what did you like best about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Everything. The culture. I really like how there's a bunch of</br>   different cultures. Whether or not everybody mingles together, there's so</br>   many cultures for me to learn and see. Food. The freedom. The fact that you</br>   don't really have to worry about the things you have to worry about here.</br>   Here, you can't even be walking at night. You have to be looking around the</br>   corner because you never know. There's probably like a 50% chance if you're</br>   walking out a night, you're probably going to get robbed. And in the</br>   States, it wasn't ever like that. I remember being 14, 15 walking home from</br>   a buddy's house at 10 and nothing you know? The security. I felt secure.</br>   And my friends, honestly. Also, the currency. Currency was like a really...</br>   How do I say this? It's pretty easy for people to make money in the States,</br>   you know. And you don't really need to have a really good job to supply</br>   enough for your house. And even people in low income still have enough to</br>   survive. And here in Mexico, you got to really hustle really hard to even</br>   survive. So that was the thing.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So do you think being in the US changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Different outlook on life, different—?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. I was definitely humbled by knowing where I come from and</br>   knowing that at any moment everything could be taken away. In a lot of</br>   ways. I can't really tell you because I haven't lived here long enough to</br>   know the difference, but yeah. Definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What were your dreams before you were deported?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Buy my little sister a house. Buying a house. It's still my dream.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Where will that house be?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: In ___. I'm definitely going back to the States.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You liked ____?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. It's not really the city that I like. It's the people that</br>   lived within it. My friends and my family and the relationships I had with</br>   coworkers and stuff. The reason I would go back is not for the city itself</br>   but for the people that are there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you came back here, you basically left your whole family. Do</br>   you have uncles, aunts, grandparents here? How did that work?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Now, here, I currently live with my grandma and my aunt at my</br>   grandma's house. But yeah, in the States, I lived with my mother.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you remember your grandma and your aunt?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, actually, my grandma is a US citizen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, she is?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Or resident. Yeah, I think she's a resident.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But she lives here?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah, but she lives here. But she goes to the States probably like</br>   once a year. She visits us once a year. Stays in the summer. Mainly in the</br>   summer because she takes care of my little sister like in summer breaks and</br>   stuff. But she stays there maybe a month. Also, I have a lot of family in</br>   California. So during the summer, my grandma leaves and she goes to Cali</br>   and she goes to ____.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that's nice that you knew her when you came back. Someone to live</br>   with that—</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Definitely.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take you to get a job?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: About a month. And that's just because I've been waiting. I came to</br>   apply at T-Tech down the street and, at the current time, they were having</br>   schedule changes and stuff. Told me to come back at a different date. And</br>   as soon as I came back for the interview, I got hired. Saw the contract and</br>   everything and I'd just been waiting for start. It was like two weeks. So</br>   it was like two week wait for the interview, then a two week wait for the</br>   start. But actually this is my second day.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was it?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: It was good. Straining. It feels like going to school. A lot of</br>   goofing around.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A lot of people similar to you?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: Yeah. A lot of people will tell you their stories in there. First</br>   couple of days everybody shared their stories. Telling where in the States</br>   they lived, if they had been deported, where they live. Some of these</br>   people were not even deported themselves. A lot of them, it was their</br>   parents got deported so they have to follow. A lot of people came willingly</br>   for some reason. Actually, our trainer is a resident. She goes to Cali back</br>   and forth and she says that she actually enjoys living in Mexico City more</br>   than in Cali. So, like, if I had to choose to stay and live in one city, it</br>   would be Mexico City. And honestly, it's not bad. Best place to live in</br>   Mexico is probably Mexico City. Definitely. I mean, it's got its dark</br>   moments, but it's a nice city. A lot of culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. A lot of culture. Someone told me more museums per capita than</br>   anywhere else in the world. Well, we're getting towards the end of this</br>   interview. So, people are going to listen to your story. Is there anything</br>   you'd like to share with them that you haven't shared thus far about your</br>   experiences in the US? About immigration policy? About anything?</br> </br> </br>   Jose: No, I just feel that more people need to be more aware of the reasons</br>   people are in the States. A lot of people think they're just there to take</br>   their jobs, but it's not. People just want a better life. People just want</br>   to be part of something. I feel the States is probably one of the best</br>   countries in the world and it will be for the future because it's a</br>   culmination of so many countries and so many cultures. You take every other</br>   culture away, what's there really in the States? Everybody in the States</br>   was an immigrant at some point and people forget that. A lot of citizens</br>   that are racist towards immigrants forget that their grandparents at some</br>   point immigrated from another country for the same reasons they did. I just</br>   want people to remember that America is a country of immigrants.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Great. Well, thank you so much.</br> </div><\p>
