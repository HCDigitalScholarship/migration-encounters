 introducing us to the American life.</span> <span id="c36b2013-652b-4d36-a4a9-05fe7c637a44" style="background: transparent" class="entity" value="SENT">So it was, basically go to school,<br>

 to be called.</span> <span id="767dfe11-13b3-42a3-8ce6-3e8382e00577" style="background: transparent" class="entity" value="SENT">And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending<br>

 sunlight, because I remember we were in a trunk at one point. And my family<br>
 tells the story as a joke, I guess it. But it seems that they forgot us in<br>
 the trunk for a little while. So yeah, that would be my earliest memories<br>
 of you know, me being in the United States, getting out of the trunk and<br>
 going to Walmart, trying to buy clothes, and just seeing everything brand<br>
 new, everything was completely different. Honestly, that's the only thing<br>
 that I can remember because I really don't have much memories of me being<br>
 young not even here in Mexico. I can't remember.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Isabel: Yeah. I mean, it's really hard to pull back on those memories. From</br> the ones that you're more sure of like going into school, any friends or</br> teachers that stood out?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I remember going to school, it was very scary for me because I</br> didn't know the language. There were many times where I would just cry. The</br> teachers would try to comfort me, but I would just scream—I didn't know</br> what was going on. Even times when I was in pain, I couldn't tell anybody</br> what was going on. So it was very difficult. I did have one friend, and</br> that was my closest friend. I was very young, so it was like I needed that,</br> to have somebody support me. You know, obviously my parents were there, but</br> maybe they spent more time trying to get them situated, and not really</br> introducing us to the American life. So it was, basically go to school,</br> you're on your own and then come back in your home. So it was basically</br> like I had to learn everything by myself.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What did you have to learn? What was picking up the different</br> cultural experiences like?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: The main thing was learning how to interact with others, because it</br> was very hard. I feel like an outsider so I wouldn't really go up to</br> people, I wouldn't go up to any other races. So it was very hard, I would</br> really stay to myself and to that just one friend. Even sports, I couldn't</br> do sports because I didn't feel like I fit in. I never felt like I fitted</br> it in. And throughout all my school experiences, I never felt like that</br> belong to me because there was many times where I had opportunities for my</br> academics to get awards or be presented with some stuff, but I was always</br> told &quot;No, you're not American so you can’t do that. And there's no way that</br> you're going to go to another state they're going deport you on the way</br> there, we're going to get pulled over.” And so, I really didn't see a</br> future there for me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Where was that message coming from? Is it just your day to day</br> interaction with people—like the way you felt othered—or did people</br> explicitly say, “You have no opportunity here?”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Mainly it was my parents. My parents wanted us to keep to</br> ourselves. My parents just raised us with that mentality that we're here,</br> we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home</br> and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,</br> didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't</br> seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just</br> that mindset that, &quot;Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and</br> something bad might happen.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So definitely…When I asked you the question, Do you fear the US</br> authorities, that was a dominant part of your childhood?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Most definitely. Going to the United States from Mexico my dad</br> still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had</br> to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending</br> because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left</br> alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many</br> times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or</br> I would have a friend that said, &quot;Let's go do this,&quot; I'll be, &quot;No, I'm</br> going to get in trouble.&quot; Or, &quot;No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from</br> here.&quot; And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had</br> Chicanos—which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that</br> were born there—and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was</br> always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, &quot;Oh I</br> have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback.&quot; And so that was</br> very, very, very difficult for me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did you have anyone to talk to about this or is this really</br> something that you just had to go through individually?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My sister, me and my sister—my sister's one year older than me—it</br> was basically me and her. If it was her being offered something, we would</br> just console each other. We would just tell each other, &quot;No, you did good.</br> It doesn't matter if you don't get the reward, it doesn't matter if you</br> don't get the prize, you did it, you got that mail certificate.&quot; So it was</br> just me and my sister.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So like in those situations, you might receive potential</br> opportunities but like, no, you can't pursue them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle</br> school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.</br> There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading</br> teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching</br> wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the</br> book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: In what grade?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I</br> feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're</br> saying I'm doing good.&quot; And I'm sorry, what was the question?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,</br> like refusing those opportunities.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I</br> got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front</br> of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on</br> Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point</br> where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate</br> inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran</br> around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that</br> risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get</br> deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was it about?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,</br> yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you</br> pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition</br> for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that</br> you can't go over.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that &quot;No, you can't.&quot;</br> Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working</br> for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,</br> what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time</br> staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.</br> So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of</br> the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that</br> work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior</br> year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on</br> it was basically work, work, work. And that was basically my life after</br> junior year—just work and work.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you</br> tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving</br> around from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction</br> and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very</br> physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,</br> he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me</br> along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to</br> want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and</br> literally just because I had his last name, it was, &quot;Okay, you got the</br> job.&quot; And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would</br> call him offering jobs or—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, &quot;Okay, I might not be able to go</br> to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own</br> kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.&quot; And so being</br> under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were</br> points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son</br> anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be</br> like, &quot;Yeah, I know who you are.&quot; At first it was all like, &quot;Okay, who are</br> you?&quot; “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then</br> after a while it was, &quot;Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you</br> and we need you to pick our store back up.&quot; And so after that, that was my</br> goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just</br> because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me</br> learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,</br> that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start</br> pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your</br> father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had</br> to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?</br> Were you together?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had</br> legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a</br> little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point</br> where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,</br> so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many</br> times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age</br> of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.</br> And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I</br> could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a</br> father.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'</br> house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got</br> my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to</br> support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.</br> So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something</br> bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It</br> was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make</br> it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you</br> were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security</br> cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than</br> what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,</br> or anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there</br> know that you were undocumented or that are younger?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 16.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I</br> Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,</br> and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know</br> you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you</br> work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the</br> other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Oh very.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Very much like more high end?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly</br> young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's enough credit.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would</br> get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're</br> at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.</br> And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The</br> reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,</br> and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also</br> be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all</br> like, &quot;Okay, so who's in charge?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that's when I said, &quot;Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to</br> do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it</br> and I got my name out there.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really</br> making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I</br> guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just</br> going into those in more detail.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,</br> 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It</br> was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in</br> the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was</br> that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we</br> weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a</br> breather, she's, &quot;No, we got to talk because we have to talk.&quot; And so that</br> day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,</br> she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I</br> saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Swooped up the baby?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the</br> floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of</br> stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off</br> with my kids—I love my kids to death.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into</br> elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,</br> because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going</br> to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from</br> school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have</br> problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're</br> going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck</br> together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we</br> didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we</br> loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to</br> take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I</br> called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put</br> her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we</br> were literally tugging at the car seat.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in</br> a car seat. I told my little brothers, &quot;You know what, I need you to sit</br> down and help me.&quot; Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want</br> anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need</br> you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two</br> brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the</br> other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they</br> told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts</br> your hands on each other, then you can call us.”</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never</br> came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out</br> of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I</br> had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two</br> daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the</br> toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the</br> back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told</br> them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off</br> with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't</br> want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's</br> crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,</br> something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they</br> would've showed up then, anyways—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, I‚</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I</br> called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have</br> ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, &quot;Take my kids, go watch</br> TV and just keep them entertained.&quot; So my wife took off, me and my kids</br> spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around</br> seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I</br> was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid</br> attention to my little baby and she said, &quot;She has a bruise.&quot; And I asked</br> her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her</br> ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, &quot;My</br> little baby got hurt, something happened.&quot; I didn’t tell my mom at the time</br> what had happened, and then I told her, &quot;What do I do?&quot; And she said,</br> &quot;Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.&quot;</br> We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers</br> were on me. They asked me, &quot;Where's the mother?&quot; And I told her, &quot;Well, the</br> mother's not here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: &quot;Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this</br> is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the</br> hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because</br> we have people that are waiting for you.&quot; As soon as I got to the hospital,</br> I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running</br> around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little</br> city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very</br> little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already</br> gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,</br> there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control</br> the situation or calm it down.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my</br> side of the story. She said, &quot;The little baby got hurt, I have four</br> children, I'm going to put you behind bars.&quot; My wife got there, they asked</br> her what happened and she said, &quot;It was his fault.&quot; This was around 1:00 AM</br> in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout</br> the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to</br> lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she</br> didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to</br> take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they</br> said, &quot;You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the</br> hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for</br> your arrest.&quot; And I told them, &quot;Okay, well hold on. What's going on?&quot; And</br> they said, &quot;We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little</br> baby.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told him, &quot;No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little</br> baby.&quot; And they said, &quot;Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give</br> you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to</br> go ahead and read you your rights.&quot; I didn't know what's going on, with</br> them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally</br> scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and</br> they told the police officer, &quot;No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't</br> have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them</br> a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.&quot;</br> So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next</br> morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout</br> the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already</br> went to my house and picked up my other children.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,</br> I called the police station and I told him, &quot;You know what? I need to know</br> whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's</br> going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I</br> don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,</br> I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something.&quot; And they</br> told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month</br> waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she</br> told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, &quot;Okay, well</br> what's next?&quot; And she said, &quot;I don't know son.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told her, &quot;Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to</br> see what's going on.&quot; The next morning, I was on my way to the police</br> station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I</br> was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was</br> walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they</br> hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see</br> me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my</br> mom, &quot;Where's he at?&quot; And she said, &quot;He's walking to the police station as</br> we speak.&quot; Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.</br> They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,</br> and literally they greeted me with, &quot;Mr ____, how are you doing?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on</br> their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police</br> station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the</br> neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, &quot;Really? I'm literally</br> in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?&quot; And I was just the</br> biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me</br> that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out</br> that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't</br> sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the</br> hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their</br> police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense</br> whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the</br> detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, &quot;Who did</br> this?&quot; And I told her, &quot;You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works</br> for the state. My mom has her own daycare.&quot; Me and my mom went to the</br> clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to</br> think, &quot;Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the</br> baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my</br> baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that</br> you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type</br> of guilt.&quot; So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to</br> the hospital because he feels guilty.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,</br> there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I</br> presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I</br> was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years</br> or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25</br> years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all</br> until my lawyer said, &quot;This is where we're at. You want to protect your</br> wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,</br> you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out</br> her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,</br> and then—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Where are the kids?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to</br> trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they</br> said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.</br> So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.</br> You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I</br> said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,</br> I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever</br> she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,</br> I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an</br> immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,</br> immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road</br> ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.</br> But I ended up being deported.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound</br> exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm</br> carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like</br> there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not</br> being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US</br> authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're</br> undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and</br> paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that</br> they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in</br> these situations.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the</br> altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and</br> she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, &quot;Please don't,</br> you're not leaving with my children.&quot; Like, when you said you're in a toxic</br> relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where</br> she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical</br> because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she</br> literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There</br> was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the</br> door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit</br> me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I</br> grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my</br> dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget</br> that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm</br> never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, &quot;Okay,</br> that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.&quot; So at first, she started</br> slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon</br> as she punched me in my eye, I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps</br> anymore, you're out of control.&quot; I held her, she was facing the wall, she</br> bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go</br> and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her</br> lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting</br> up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,</br> “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go</br> to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she</br> picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the</br> phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.</br> I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them</br> down and I told them, &quot;Hey, you know what, this is what happened.&quot; They</br> took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of</br> the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only</br> point it ever got to a physical altercation.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Just in the moment when your baby fell off the bed, was she pushed</br> back onto the bed and then that—</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was because of that same reason that she did not let me leave</br> the room. And so I got her, and I moved her away from the door. I literally</br> got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That is just such a tragic…Like it's the worst way that could have</br> gone. Again, I'm so sorry that it went like that. And thank you for sharing</br> that, and that was the most difficult thing to -</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No, it's actually the very first time that I've been able to tell</br> this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to</br> embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s</br> Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids</br> literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My</br> first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw</br> lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I</br> was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke</br> down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I</br> used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I</br> walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult</br> mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to</br> say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,</br> for all that work to just be taken away just like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,</br> being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own</br> father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from</br> that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a</br> father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that</br> you never wanted to be.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was</br> the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me</br> and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want</br> to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my</br> kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.</br> I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are</br> they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you</br> had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,</br> socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on</br> your return?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent</br> the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't</br> want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and</br> I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, &quot;Will I get in trouble</br> if I walk around the streets with the beer?&quot; And she said, &quot;You'll be fine.</br> You have two or 300 pesos, right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah I just came back from the</br> United States, I have money.&quot; “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,</br> just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very</br> first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my</br> family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, well it's in my</br> blood. Let's go for it.&quot; And literally there will be times where I would</br> just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice</br> and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about</br> half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a</br> lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on</br> my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the</br> door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just</br> literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just</br> [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they</br> literally—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Who’s everybody?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family</br> sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They</br> literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because</br> just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it</br> was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,</br> very first time. So I told myself, &quot;How do you not remember this happening?</br> How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What</br> did you do?&quot; And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,</br> that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United</br> States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times</br> where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and</br> literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,</br> that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because</br> for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the</br> middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around</br> the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the</br> street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted</br> somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling</br> me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,</br> and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a</br> big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any</br> of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there</br> she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,</br> she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she</br> was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.</br> So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, &quot;You know what,</br> your son is doing this&quot; [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and</br> that's when I said, I told my mom, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my</br> father did, so I'm done.&quot; And that was it. That's when I said, &quot;I'm not</br> going to do this again to my mom.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And that was kind of like your early experience, kind of struggling</br> to be back in Mexico and come to terms with not being with your family. So</br> where did you go from there, not only just job wise but, also, how long</br> have you been back? And like what's been going on since then?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, from there they said I needed some time for myself to think.</br> So I got offered a trip to Cancun, they paid for a month for me to be in</br> Cancun. And literally I just vacationed and spend some time there. And I</br> went with a cousin and we literally had so much fun that I said, &quot;You know</br> what, maybe things will be alright. From the difference of coming here to</br> the state of Mexico and going to Cancun, Cancun was more lifestyle of what</br> I was used to, more English, everything was so pretty. So I was like,</br> &quot;Okay, well they have places like this in Mexico, so maybe I could do this,</br> maybe I could bring my kids down here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And I spent a month in Cancun. And from there I came back to the</br> city and I tried Uber. It was very difficult for me because I didn't know</br> the traffic, how it worked. Literally all the speed bumps, I would pass</br> over them going very fast and people would freak out, but I would just</br> always tell them, &quot;You know what, over there in the United States, they'll</br> let you know if the speed bumps are coming&quot; [Both laugh]. And so, I wasn't</br> able to do Uber; I got kicked out of Uber. I tried doing my studies, that</br> was very difficult and I'm still not able to do it because they won't</br> validate my credits that I have from high school. They said that I have to</br> go literally start from elementary all the way up. So I couldn't continue</br> with my schools.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That got put on pause. And so I started visiting Mexico City. I</br> started walking around Mexico City, the nice areas and that's when I</br> started learning about these call centers. I applied for a call center, and</br> it seemed all right money, compared to what everybody else was making. And,</br> you know, it wasn't anywhere close to what I was making the United States,</br> but for this lifestyle of me in Mexico City, it was all right. And that was</br> difficult for me as well because I lived in the state. And so I would have</br> to transport three, four hours to get to my job. I would have to wake up at</br> 4:00 in the morning and get to my job at 8:00 in the morning. And I'd come</br> home at 11:00, 12:00 at night.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that went on for about four or five months until I literally</br> said, “I can't do this anymore.” I resigned from AT&amp;amp;T, and I've</br> literally been stuck since then besides from my mom giving me what she</br> can—my mom doesn't work so the main income is from my father. Me and my</br> father not having that awesome relationship, I feel shameful asking for him</br> for anything. So, there'd be times where my mom would send me $10, $20, and</br> literally got me two or three days, and that's literally how it's been</br> going on for past couple of months.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Until recently I was staying with family, and one thing led to</br> another—my aunt from the United States visited and she did not like how</br> things were going for me. She said, &quot;You're just sitting around, and you</br> have no need to work because people are sending you money, so I'm going to</br> give you a need to work.&quot; [Chuckles]. And she kicked me out. And literally</br> that was two days ago. So that's where I found New Comienzos. I've been</br> running around trying to try to get help because literally right now, I'm</br> on my own. I literally had to break down to my dad. I broke down, and I</br> told him, &quot;I need your help. I need you to be there.&quot; And he heard me, and</br> so just yesterday I got my apartment, and, you know, moving forward.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I understand how you would really not want to ask anything</br> from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped</br> one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s</br> important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for</br> detention for two months?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Two months. Do you mind just touching on the conditions or like the</br> treatment you experienced there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the</br> immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things</br> breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary</br> was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,</br> they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their</br> case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,</br> citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask</br> them, &quot;If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, &quot;Well,</br> you know, they deport you tomorrow.&quot; And I called my dad and I told him,</br> &quot;Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be</br> here. I'll sign my deportation.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that</br> to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge</br> and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and</br> you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're</br> considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact</br> words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,</br> &quot;Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my</br> brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this.&quot; And</br> it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no</br> emotion with him. It was, &quot;No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.</br> But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So it was like, &quot;Why are you giving me the option to fight my case</br> if...[Sigh]&quot; So I told him, &quot;Okay, well let's sign.&quot; And literally the next</br> day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be</br> there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and</br> literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on</br> their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, &quot;If they can't</br> do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?&quot; And that</br> was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't</br> be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.</br> I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way</br> of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had</br> to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want</br> anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a</br> father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be</br> imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there</br> will be a lot of guards that would tell me, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And</br> there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,</br> &quot;Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his</br> rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a</br> criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal.&quot; And it was just so</br> hard for me to stay focused on, &quot;No, you got to get out of this, you're</br> going to get out of this.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just</br> explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much</br> on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called</br> something, it was just put your head down and, &quot;Okay, no, you're right.&quot;</br> And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in</br> immigration. It was just that, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And there was</br> nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it</br> was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,</br> do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the</br> way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself</br> and I didn't mess what anybody.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: If things had gone a different way, and that moment that you</br> describe hadn't happened, what do you think you would be doing, like what</br> would be your dreams to do in the United States?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: To have my store, to have my restaurants. I want my restaurant and</br> I still want it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What would you call it?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: All styles, all around the world restaurant. That's what I want,</br> all around the world restaurant. Something from every place. And that's</br> what I wanted to, I want to travel the world, I want to learn every single</br> style of cooking. I got Italian down, I got American style down, and I had</br> a little bit of the London, English, all that. And I just want to keep</br> learning, and I want to expand my portfolio, I want to learn as much as</br> there is, and that's my dream one day to have my own store, maybe here in</br> Mexico—most definitely here in Mexico because I really don't see any</br> chances for me to go back.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's your plan for Mexico too, or your dream?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My dream to have my own store. That's my dream, that's my goal, to</br> have my own restaurant, that's my passion. I love the reaction from the</br> clients and I just love making good food.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's awesome. Well, I hope you pursue that dream. Just some</br> general questions that we like to touch on, you can take them whichever</br> direction you want. Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American or do</br> you consider yourself Mexican or American?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: American.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: American, 100%?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 100% American.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking</br> around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].</br> So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I</br> talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I</br> guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it</br> and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and</br> down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't</br> belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and</br> I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much</br> all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all</br> that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal</br> ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in</br> America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was</br> some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Despite your own experience with the US justice system, you have</br> like a larger faith that it is still like less corrupt than Mexico. Is that</br> kind of what you're saying?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, it's very difficult because in the United States, when I</br> would think about corruptions or anything like that, I think about families</br> getting separated, all this stuff that's going on now with the news, with</br> the President. Those are the bad things that I see up at the United States,</br> about just this one guy has a problem with -- had an argument with one</br> Mexican one day and it ruined his image for the rest of his life, and now a</br> whole country has to has to suffer because of that. And I feel like the</br> corruption here in Mexico is more inside of Mexico, more of being corrupt</br> here and not having to do anything with any other countries or anything</br> like that. But I do feel like there could've been more done.</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="16c1ff49-512f-412f-becb-803304e62787" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Worst parts, Time in the US, Arrests, False Accusations, Prison, Feelings, Despair, Frustration, Leaving the US, Court Proceedings, Reasons for Exit, Deportation">Angelo: There could have been more people that heard my story, there could<br>
 have been... Somebody should have said this is not right. Somebody<br>
 should've said the police report is not right. I promise anybody could read<br>
 the police report and it makes no sense, it makes no sense whatsoever. And<br>
 I just feel like somebody could have said, &quot;Well, hold on, this makes no<br>
 sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened.&quot; But it was never,<br>
 &quot;Okay, what happened?&quot; It was always, &quot;Okay, you did this.&quot; So that's where<br>
 I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had<br>
 no voice—and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the<br>
 bad guy because a little baby got hurt.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were<br>
 people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said<br>
 something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,<br>
 &quot;You know what, he did something,&quot; it was, &quot;You're going to jail,&quot; just<br>
 because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,<br>
 and just hearing all these stories, I was like, &quot;There's no way that I'm<br>
 going to get past this.&quot; And literally the very first offer was 30 years.<br>
 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had<br>
 to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was<br>
 not me, I wasn't what they had on paper. I was not that person, I was<br>
 different, I was completely—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Opposite of the criminals that you were surrounded by?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Exactly. And just hearing all these stories of people going through<br>
 things in jail of all these things, I told myself, &quot;Why are you here then?<br>
 You're not supposed to be here. Why am I still here after six months? Why<br>
 am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing<br>
 for some time?&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going<br>
 to go home, you're going to see your mom.&quot; And then out of nowhere you get<br>
 this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, &quot;No, no, no, no,<br>
 no, no, no, no. That's not what's supposed to be happening. No.&quot; And so it<br>
 was like literally the world ended, and everything was taken just so fast.<br>
 The only things that I have left is pictures just because of the situation<br>
 that happened, I am not on good terms with the mother of my kids. And all<br>
 I'm left with is pictures and just memories and that's the hardest. Not<br>
 being able to just have some type of context, some type of pictures, or<br>
 recent pictures and updates, something, something, something, it's very<br>
 hard.<br>
      <br>

 have been... Somebody should have said this is not right. Somebody<br>
 should've said the police report is not right. I promise anybody could read<br>
 the police report and it makes no sense, it makes no sense whatsoever. And<br>
 I just feel like somebody could have said, &quot;Well, hold on, this makes no<br>
 sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened.&quot; But it was never,<br>
 &quot;Okay, what happened?&quot; It was always, &quot;Okay, you did this.&quot; So that's where<br>
 I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had<br>
 no voice—and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the<br>
 bad guy because a little baby got hurt.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were<br>
 people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said<br>
 something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,<br>
 &quot;You know what, he did something,&quot; it was, &quot;You're going to jail,&quot; just<br>
 because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,<br>
 and just hearing all these stories, I was like, &quot;There's no way that I'm<br>
 going to get past this.&quot; And literally the very first offer was 30 years.<br>

 general questions that we like to touch on, you can take them whichever<br>
 direction you want. Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American or do<br>
 you consider yourself Mexican or American?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: American.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: American, 100%?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: 100% American.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Why do you think that is?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking<br>
 around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].<br>
 So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I<br>
 talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I<br>
 guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it<br>
 and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and<br>
 down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't<br>
 belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and<br>
 I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much<br>
 all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all<br>
 that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal<br>
 ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in<br>
 America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was<br>
 some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.<br>

I understand how you would really not want to ask anything<br>
 from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped<br>
 one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s<br>
 important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for<br>
 detention for two months?<br>
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>

 treatment you experienced there?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the<br>
 immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things<br>
 breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary<br>
 was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,<br>
 they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their<br>
 case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,<br>
 citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask<br>
 them, &quot;If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, &quot;Well,<br>
 you know, they deport you tomorrow.&quot; And I called my dad and I told him,<br>
 &quot;Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be<br>
 here. I'll sign my deportation.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that<br>
 to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge<br>
 and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and<br>
 you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're<br>
 considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact<br>
 words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,<br>
 &quot;Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my<br>
 brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this.&quot; And<br>
 it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no<br>
 emotion with him. It was, &quot;No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.<br>
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So it was like, &quot;Why are you giving me the option to fight my case<br>
 if...[Sigh]&quot; So I told him, &quot;Okay, well let's sign.&quot; And literally the next<br>
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be<br>
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and<br>
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on<br>
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, &quot;If they can't<br>
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?&quot; And that<br>
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't<br>
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.<br>
 I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way<br>
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had<br>
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want<br>
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a<br>
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be<br>
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there<br>
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And<br>
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,<br>
 &quot;Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his<br>
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a<br>
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal.&quot; And it was just so<br>
 hard for me to stay focused on, &quot;No, you got to get out of this, you're<br>
 going to get out of this.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just<br>
 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much<br>
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called<br>
 something, it was just put your head down and, &quot;Okay, no, you're right.&quot;<br>
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in<br>
 immigration. It was just that, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And there was<br>
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it<br>
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,<br>
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the<br>
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself<br>
 and I didn't mess what anybody.<br>

 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called<br>
 something, it was just put your head down and, &quot;Okay, no, you're right.&quot;<br>
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in<br>
 immigration. It was just that, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And there was<br>
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it<br>
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,<br>
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the<br>
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself<br>
 and I didn't mess what anybody.<br>

 from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped<br>
 one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s<br>
 important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for<br>
 detention for two months?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Two months. Do you mind just touching on the conditions or like the<br>
 treatment you experienced there?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the<br>
 immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things<br>
 breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary<br>
 was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,<br>
 they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their<br>
 case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,<br>
 citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask<br>
 them, &quot;If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, &quot;Well,<br>
 you know, they deport you tomorrow.&quot; And I called my dad and I told him,<br>
 &quot;Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be<br>
 here. I'll sign my deportation.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that<br>
 to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge<br>
 and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and<br>
 you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're<br>
 considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact<br>
 words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,<br>
 &quot;Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my<br>
 brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this.&quot; And<br>
 it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no<br>
 emotion with him. It was, &quot;No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.<br>
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So it was like, &quot;Why are you giving me the option to fight my case<br>
 if...[Sigh]&quot; So I told him, &quot;Okay, well let's sign.&quot; And literally the next<br>
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be<br>
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and<br>
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on<br>
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, &quot;If they can't<br>
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?&quot; And that<br>
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't<br>
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.<br>
 I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way<br>
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had<br>
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want<br>
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a<br>
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be<br>
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there<br>
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And<br>
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,<br>
 &quot;Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his<br>
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a<br>
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal.&quot; And it was just so<br>
 hard for me to stay focused on, &quot;No, you got to get out of this, you're<br>
 going to get out of this.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just<br>

</span><span id="176f3c48-7b8f-463c-9df3-03a9ec932f93" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Interactions with police, Corruption">The very first thing I did was go to a store, and<br>
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, &quot;Will I get in trouble<br>
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?&quot; And she said, &quot;You'll be fine.<br>
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah I just came back from the<br>
 United States, I have money.&quot; “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,<br>
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. </span>“So that was the very</br> first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my</br> family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, well it's in my</br> blood. Let's go for it.&quot; And literally there will be times where I would</br> just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice</br> and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about</br> half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a</br> lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on</br> my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the</br> door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just</br> literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just</br> [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they</br> literally—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Who’s everybody?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family</br> sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They</br> literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because</br> just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it</br> was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,</br> very first time. So I told myself, &quot;How do you not remember this happening?</br> How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What</br> did you do?&quot; And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,</br> that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United</br> States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times</br> where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and</br> literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,</br> that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because</br> for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the</br> middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around</br> the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the</br> street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted</br> somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling</br> me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,</br> and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a</br> big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any</br> of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there</br> she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,</br> she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she</br> was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.</br> So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, &quot;You know what,</br> your son is doing this&quot; [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and</br> that's when I said, I told my mom, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my</br> father did, so I'm done.&quot; And that was it. That's when I said, &quot;I'm not</br> going to do this again to my mom.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And that was kind of like your early experience, kind of struggling</br> to be back in Mexico and come to terms with not being with your family. So</br> where did you go from there, not only just job wise but, also, how long</br> have you been back? And like what's been going on since then?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, from there they said I needed some time for myself to think.</br> So I got offered a trip to Cancun, they paid for a month for me to be in</br> Cancun. And literally I just vacationed and spend some time there. And I</br> went with a cousin and we literally had so much fun that I said, &quot;You know</br> what, maybe things will be alright. From the difference of coming here to</br> the state of Mexico and going to Cancun, Cancun was more lifestyle of what</br> I was used to, more English, everything was so pretty. So I was like,</br> &quot;Okay, well they have places like this in Mexico, so maybe I could do this,</br> maybe I could bring my kids down here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And I spent a month in Cancun. And from there I came back to the</br> city and I tried Uber. It was very difficult for me because I didn't know</br> the traffic, how it worked. Literally all the speed bumps, I would pass</br> over them going very fast and people would freak out, but I would just</br> always tell them, &quot;You know what, over there in the United States, they'll</br> let you know if the speed bumps are coming&quot; [Both laugh]. And so, I wasn't</br> able to do Uber; I got kicked out of Uber. I tried doing my studies, that</br> was very difficult and I'm still not able to do it because they won't</br> validate my credits that I have from high school. They said that I have to</br> go literally start from elementary all the way up. So I couldn't continue</br> with my schools.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That got put on pause. And so I started visiting Mexico City. I</br> started walking around Mexico City, the nice areas and that's when I</br> started learning about these call centers. I applied for a call center, and</br> it seemed all right money, compared to what everybody else was making. And,</br> you know, it wasn't anywhere close to what I was making the United States,</br> but for this lifestyle of me in Mexico City, it was all right. And that was</br> difficult for me as well because I lived in the state. And so I would have</br> to transport three, four hours to get to my job. I would have to wake up at</br> 4:00 in the morning and get to my job at 8:00 in the morning. And I'd come</br> home at 11:00, 12:00 at night.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that went on for about four or five months until I literally</br> said, “I can't do this anymore.” I resigned from AT&amp;amp;T, and I've</br> literally been stuck since then besides from my mom giving me what she</br> can—my mom doesn't work so the main income is from my father. Me and my</br> father not having that awesome relationship, I feel shameful asking for him</br> for anything. So, there'd be times where my mom would send me $10, $20, and</br> literally got me two or three days, and that's literally how it's been</br> going on for past couple of months.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Until recently I was staying with family, and one thing led to</br> another—my aunt from the United States visited and she did not like how</br> things were going for me. She said, &quot;You're just sitting around, and you</br> have no need to work because people are sending you money, so I'm going to</br> give you a need to work.&quot; [Chuckles]. And she kicked me out. And literally</br> that was two days ago. So that's where I found New Comienzos. I've been</br> running around trying to try to get help because literally right now, I'm</br> on my own. I literally had to break down to my dad. I broke down, and I</br> told him, &quot;I need your help. I need you to be there.&quot; And he heard me, and</br> so just yesterday I got my apartment, and, you know, moving forward.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I understand how you would really not want to ask anything</br> from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped</br> one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s</br> important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for</br> detention for two months?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Two months.

I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.</br> I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way</br> of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had</br> to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want</br> anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a</br> father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be</br> imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there</br> will be a lot of guards that would tell me, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And</br> there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,</br> &quot;Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his</br> rest of his life, you're getting treated bad.

Every single time that I got called</br> something, it was just put your head down and, &quot;Okay, no, you're right.&quot;</br> And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in</br> immigration. It was just that, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And there was</br> nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it</br> was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,</br> do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the</br> way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself</br> and I didn't mess what anybody.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: If things had gone a different way, and that moment that you</br> describe hadn't happened, what do you think you would be doing, like what</br> would be your dreams to do in the United States?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: To have my store, to have my restaurants. I want my restaurant and</br> I still want it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What would you call it?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: All styles, all around the world restaurant. That's what I want,</br> all around the world restaurant. Something from every place. And that's</br> what I wanted to, I want to travel the world, I want to learn every single</br> style of cooking. I got Italian down, I got American style down, and I had</br> a little bit of the London, English, all that. And I just want to keep</br> learning, and I want to expand my portfolio, I want to learn as much as</br> there is, and that's my dream one day to have my own store, maybe here in</br> Mexico—most definitely here in Mexico because I really don't see any</br> chances for me to go back.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's your plan for Mexico too, or your dream?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My dream to have my own store. That's my dream, that's my goal, to</br> have my own restaurant, that's my passion. I love the reaction from the</br> clients and I just love making good food.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's awesome. Well, I hope you pursue that dream. Just some</br> general questions that we like to touch on, you can take them whichever</br> direction you want. Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American or do</br> you consider yourself Mexican or American?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: American.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: American, 100%?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 100% American.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking</br> around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].</br> So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I</br> talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I</br> guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it</br> and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and</br> down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't</br> belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and</br> I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much</br> all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all</br> that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal</br> ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in</br> America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was</br> some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Despite your own experience with the US justice system, you have</br> like a larger faith that it is still like less corrupt than Mexico. Is that</br> kind of what you're saying?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, it's very difficult because in the United States, when I</br> would think about corruptions or anything like that, I think about families</br> getting separated, all this stuff that's going on now with the news, with</br> the President. Those are the bad things that I see up at the United States,</br> about just this one guy has a problem with -- had an argument with one</br> Mexican one day and it ruined his image for the rest of his life, and now a</br> whole country has to has to suffer because of that. And I feel like the</br> corruption here in Mexico is more inside of Mexico, more of being corrupt</br> here and not having to do anything with any other countries or anything</br> like that. But I do feel like there could've been more done.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: There could have been more people that heard my story, there could</br> have been... Somebody should have said this is not right. Somebody</br> should've said the police report is not right. I promise anybody could read</br> the police report and it makes no sense, it makes no sense whatsoever. And</br> I just feel like somebody could have said, &quot;Well, hold on, this makes no</br> sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened.&quot; But it was never,</br> &quot;Okay, what happened?&quot; It was always, &quot;Okay, you did this.&quot; So that's where</br> I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had</br> no voice—and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the</br> bad guy because a little baby got hurt.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were</br> people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said</br> something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,</br> &quot;You know what, he did something,&quot; it was, &quot;You're going to jail,&quot; just</br> because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,</br> and just hearing all these stories, I was like, &quot;There's no way that I'm</br> going to get past this.&quot; And literally the very first offer was 30 years.</br> 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had</br> to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was</br> not me, I wasn't what they had on paper. I was not that person, I was</br> different, I was completely—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Opposite of the criminals that you were surrounded by?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly. And just hearing all these stories of people going through</br> things in jail of all these things, I told myself, &quot;Why are you here then?</br> You're not supposed to be here. Why am I still here after six months? Why</br> am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing</br> for some time?&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going</br> to go home, you're going to see your mom.&quot; And then out of nowhere you get</br> this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, &quot;No, no, no, no,</br> no, no, no, no. That's not what's supposed to be happening. No.&quot; And so it</br> was like literally the world ended, and everything was taken just so fast.</br> The only things that I have left is pictures just because of the situation</br> that happened, I am not on good terms with the mother of my kids. And all</br> I'm left with is pictures and just memories and that's the hardest. Not</br> being able to just have some type of context, some type of pictures, or</br> recent pictures and updates, something, something, something, it's very</br> hard.</br>      </br>      </br> .Isabel: (pause) Is there anything else you would like to reflect on or you</br> people to know like before we wrap up?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I plan to have a future, I'm going to have a future, and it's not</br> going to stop me. It's been hard, the past couple of years have been hard,</br> but I still have kids. I want them to be here, so this is not going to stop</br> me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Thank you so much for sharing<span id="b97c3a0f-dd31-4567-bd09-d21ec1b43e8b" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Employment, Economic well-being, Continuing education, Jobs, Occupation, Call Centers, Dead end"></span> parents. My parents wanted us to keep to</br> ourselves. My parents just raised us with that mentality that we're here,</br> we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home</br> and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,</br> didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't</br> seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just</br> that mindset that, &quot;Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and</br> something bad might happen.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So definitely…When I asked you the question, Do you fear the US</br> authorities, that was a dominant part of your childhood?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Most definitely. Going to the United States from Mexico my dad</br> still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had</br> to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending</br> because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left</br> alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many</br> times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or</br> I would have a friend that said, &quot;Let's go do this,&quot; I'll be, &quot;No, I'm</br> going to get in trouble.&quot; Or, &quot;No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from</br> here.&quot; And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had</br> Chicanos—which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that</br> were born there—and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was</br> always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, &quot;Oh I</br> have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback.&quot; And so that was</br> very, very, very difficult for me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did you have anyone to talk to about this or is this really</br> something that you just had to go through individually?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My sister, me and my sister—my sister's one year older than me—it</br> was basically me and her. If it was her being offered something, we would</br> just console each other. We would just tell each other, &quot;No, you did good.</br> It doesn't matter if you don't get the reward, it doesn't matter if you</br> don't get the prize, you did it, you got that mail certificate.&quot; So it was</br> just me and my sister.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So like in those situations, you might receive potential</br> opportunities but like, no, you can't pursue them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle</br> school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.</br> There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading</br> teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching</br> wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the</br> book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: In what grade?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I</br> feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're</br> saying I'm doing good.&quot; And I'm sorry, what was the question?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,</br> like refusing those opportunities.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I</br> got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front</br> of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on</br> Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point</br> where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate</br> inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran</br> around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that</br> risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get</br> deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was it about?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,</br> yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you</br> pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition</br> for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that</br> you can't go over.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that &quot;No, you can't.&quot;</br> Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working</br> for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,</br> what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time</br> staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.</br> So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of</br> the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that</br> work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior</br> year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on</br> it was basically work, work, work. And that was basically my life after</br> junior year—just work and work.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you</br> tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving</br> around from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction</br> and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very</br> physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,</br> he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me</br> along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to</br> want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and</br> literally just because I had his last name, it was, &quot;Okay, you got the</br> job.&quot; And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would</br> call him offering jobs or—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, &quot;Okay, I might not be able to go</br> to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own</br> kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.&quot; And so being</br> under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were</br> points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son</br> anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be</br> like, &quot;Yeah, I know who you are.&quot; At first it was all like, &quot;Okay, who are</br> you?&quot; “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then</br> after a while it was, &quot;Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you</br> and we need you to pick our store back up.&quot; And so after that, that was my</br> goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just</br> because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me</br> learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,</br> that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start</br> pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your</br> father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had</br> to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?</br> Were you together?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had</br> legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a</br> little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point</br> where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,</br> so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many</br> times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age</br> of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.</br> And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I</br> could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a</br> father.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'</br> house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got</br> my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to</br> support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.</br> So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something</br> bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It</br> was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make</br> it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you</br> were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security</br> cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than</br> what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,</br> or anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there</br> know that you were undocumented or that are younger?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 16.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I</br> Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,</br> and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know</br> you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you</br> work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the</br> other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Oh very.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Very much like more high end?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly</br> young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's enough credit.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would</br> get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're</br> at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.</br> And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The</br> reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,</br> and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also</br> be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all</br> like, &quot;Okay, so who's in charge?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that's when I said, &quot;Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to</br> do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it</br> and I got my name out there.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really</br> making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I</br> guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just</br> going into those in more detail.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,</br> 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It</br> was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in</br> the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was</br> that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we</br> weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a</br> breather, she's, &quot;No, we got to talk because we have to talk.&quot; And so that</br> day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,</br> she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I</br> saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Swooped up the baby?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the</br> floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of</br> stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off</br> with my kids—I love my kids to death.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into</br> elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,</br> because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going</br> to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from</br> school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have</br> problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're</br> going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck</br> together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we</br> didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we</br> loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to</br> take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I</br> called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put</br> her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we</br> were literally tugging at the car seat.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in</br> a car seat. I told my little brothers, &quot;You know what, I need you to sit</br> down and help me.&quot; Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want</br> anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need</br> you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two</br> brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the</br> other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they</br> told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts</br> your hands on each other, then you can call us.”</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never</br> came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out</br> of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I</br> had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two</br> daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the</br> toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the</br> back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told</br> them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off</br> with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't</br> want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's</br> crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,</br> something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they</br> would've showed up then, anyways—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, I‚</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I</br> called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have</br> ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, &quot;Take my kids, go watch</br> TV and just keep them entertained.&quot; So my wife took off, me and my kids</br> spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around</br> seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I</br> was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid</br> attention to my little baby and she said, &quot;She has a bruise.&quot; And I asked</br> her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her</br> ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, &quot;My</br> little baby got hurt, something happened.&quot; I didn’t tell my mom at the time</br> what had happened, and then I told her, &quot;What do I do?&quot; And she said,</br> &quot;Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.&quot;</br> We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers</br> were on me. They asked me, &quot;Where's the mother?&quot; And I told her, &quot;Well, the</br> mother's not here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: &quot;Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this</br> is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the</br> hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because</br> we have people that are waiting for you.&quot; As soon as I got to the hospital,</br> I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running</br> around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little</br> city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very</br> little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already</br> gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,</br> there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control</br> the situation or calm it down.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my</br> side of the story. She said, &quot;The little baby got hurt, I have four</br> children, I'm going to put you behind bars.&quot; My wife got there, they asked</br> her what happened and she said, &quot;It was his fault.&quot; This was around 1:00 AM</br> in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout</br> the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to</br> lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she</br> didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to</br> take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they</br> said, &quot;You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the</br> hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for</br> your arrest.&quot; And I told them, &quot;Okay, well hold on. What's going on?&quot; And</br> they said, &quot;We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little</br> baby.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told him, &quot;No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little</br> baby.&quot; And they said, &quot;Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give</br> you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to</br> go ahead and read you your rights.&quot; I didn't know what's going on, with</br> them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally</br> scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and</br> they told the police officer, &quot;No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't</br> have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them</br> a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.&quot;</br> So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next</br> morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout</br> the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already</br> went to my house and picked up my other children.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,</br> I called the police station and I told him, &quot;You know what? I need to know</br> whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's</br> going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I</br> don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,</br> I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something.&quot; And they</br> told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month</br> waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she</br> told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, &quot;Okay, well</br> what's next?&quot; And she said, &quot;I don't know son.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told her, &quot;Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to</br> see what's going on.&quot; The next morning, I was on my way to the police</br> station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I</br> was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was</br> walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they</br> hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see</br> me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my</br> mom, &quot;Where's he at?&quot; And she said, &quot;He's walking to the police station as</br> we speak.&quot; Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.</br> They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,</br> and literally they greeted me with, &quot;Mr ____, how are you doing?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on</br> their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police</br> station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the</br> neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, &quot;Really? I'm literally</br> in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?&quot; And I was just the</br> biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me</br> that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out</br> that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't</br> sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the</br> hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their</br> police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense</br> whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the</br> detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, &quot;Who did</br> this?&quot; And I told her, &quot;You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works</br> for the state. My mom has her own daycare.&quot; Me and my mom went to the</br> clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to</br> think, &quot;Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the</br> baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my</br> baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that</br> you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type</br> of guilt.&quot; So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to</br> the hospital because he feels guilty.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,</br> there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I</br> presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I</br> was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years</br> or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25</br> years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all</br> until my lawyer said, &quot;This is where we're at. You want to protect your</br> wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,</br> you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out</br> her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,</br> and then—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Where are the kids?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to</br> trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they</br> said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.</br> So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.</br> You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I</br> said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,</br> I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever</br> she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,</br> I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an</br> immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,</br> immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road</br> ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.</br> But I ended up being deported.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound</br> exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm</br> carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like</br> there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not</br> being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US</br> authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're</br> undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and</br> paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that</br> they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in</br> these situations.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the</br> altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and</br> she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, &quot;Please don't,</br> you're not leaving with my children.&quot; Like, when you said you're in a toxic</br> relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where</br> she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical</br> because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she</br> literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There</br> was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the</br> door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit</br> me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I</br> grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my</br> dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget</br> that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm</br> never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, &quot;Okay,</br> that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.&quot; So at first, she started</br> slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon</br> as she punched me in my eye, I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps</br> anymore, you're out of control.&quot; I held her, she was facing the wall, she</br> bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go</br> and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her</br> lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting</br> up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,</br> “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go</br> to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she</br> picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the</br> phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.</br> I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them</br> down and I told them, &quot;Hey, you know what, this is what happened.&quot; They</br> took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of</br> the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only</br> point it ever got to a physical altercation.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Just in the moment when your baby fell off the bed, was she pushed</br> back onto the bed and then that—</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was because of that same reason that she did not let me leave</br> the room. And so I got her, and I moved her away from the door. I literally</br> got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That is just such a tragic…Like it's the worst way that could have</br> gone. Again, I'm so sorry that it went like that. And thank you for sharing</br> that, and that was the most difficult thing to -</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="2b79496c-6db4-42cd-bd06-9c95ef51f906" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Family Separation, Mental Health, Family Relationships, Feelings, Sadness, Disappointment, Frustration, Despair">Angelo: No, it's actually the very first time that I've been able to tell<br>
 this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to<br>
 embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s<br>
 Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids<br>
 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My<br>
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw<br>
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I<br>
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke<br>
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I<br>
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I<br>
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult<br>
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to<br>
 say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,<br>
 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,<br>
 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own<br>
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from<br>
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a<br>
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Exactly.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that<br>
 you never wanted to be.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was<br>
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me<br>
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want<br>
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my<br>
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.<br>
 I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are<br>
 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you<br>
 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,<br>
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on<br>
 your return?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent<br>
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't<br>
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and<br>
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, &quot;Will I get in trouble<br>
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?&quot; And she said, &quot;You'll be fine.<br>
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah I just came back from the<br>
 United States, I have money.&quot; “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,<br>
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very<br>
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my<br>
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, well it's in my<br>
 blood. Let's go for it.&quot; And literally there will be times where I would<br>
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice<br>
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about<br>
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a<br>
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on<br>
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the<br>
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just<br>
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just<br>
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they<br>
 literally—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family<br>
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They<br>
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because<br>
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it<br>
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,<br>
 very first time. So I told myself, &quot;How do you not remember this happening?<br>
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What<br>
 did you do?&quot; And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,<br>
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United<br>
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times<br>
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and<br>
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,<br>
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because<br>
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the<br>
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around<br>
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the<br>
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted<br>
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling<br>
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,<br>
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a<br>
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any<br>
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there<br>
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,<br>
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she<br>
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.<br>
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, &quot;You know what,<br>
 your son is doing this&quot; [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and<br>
 that's when I said, I told my mom, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my<br>
 father did, so I'm done.&quot; And that was it. That's when I said, &quot;I'm not<br>
 going to do this again to my mom.&quot;<br>

 this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to<br>
 embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s<br>
 Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids<br>
 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My<br>
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw<br>
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I<br>
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke<br>
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I<br>
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I<br>
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult<br>
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to<br>
 say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,<br>
 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,<br>
 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own<br>
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from<br>
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a<br>
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Exactly.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that<br>
 you never wanted to be.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was<br>
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me<br>
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want<br>
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my<br>
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.<br>
 I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are<br>
 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you<br>
 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,<br>
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on<br>
 your return?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent<br>
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't<br>
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and<br>
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, &quot;Will I get in trouble<br>
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?&quot; And she said, &quot;You'll be fine.<br>
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah I just came back from the<br>
 United States, I have money.&quot; “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,<br>
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very<br>
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my<br>
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, well it's in my<br>
 blood. Let's go for it.&quot; And literally there will be times where I would<br>
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice<br>
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about<br>
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a<br>
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on<br>
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the<br>
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just<br>
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just<br>
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they<br>
 literally—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family<br>
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They<br>
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because<br>
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it<br>
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,<br>
 very first time. So I told myself, &quot;How do you not remember this happening?<br>
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What<br>
 did you do?&quot; And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,<br>
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United<br>
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times<br>
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and<br>
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,<br>
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because<br>
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the<br>
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around<br>
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the<br>
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted<br>
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling<br>
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,<br>
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a<br>
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any<br>
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there<br>
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,<br>
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she<br>
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.<br>
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, &quot;You know what,<br>
 your son is doing this&quot; [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and<br>
 that's when I said, I told my mom, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my<br>
 father did, so I'm done.&quot; And that was it. That's when I said, &quot;I'm not<br>
 going to do this again to my mom.&quot;<br>

 very first time. So I told myself, &quot;How do you not remember this happening?<br>
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What<br>
 did you do?&quot; And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,<br>
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United<br>
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times<br>
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and<br>
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,<br>
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because<br>
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the<br>
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around<br>
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the<br>
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted<br>
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling<br>
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,<br>
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a<br>
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any<br>
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there<br>
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,<br>
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she<br>
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.<br>
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, &quot;You know what,<br>
 your son is doing this&quot; [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and<br>
 that's when I said, I told my mom, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my<br>
 father did, so I'm done.&quot; And that was it. That's when I said, &quot;I'm not<br>
 going to do this again to my mom.&quot;<br>

 back onto the bed and then that—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: It was because of that same reason that she did not let me leave<br>
 the room. And so I got her, and I moved her away from the door. I literally<br>
 got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That is just such a tragic…Like it's the worst way that could have<br>
 gone. Again, I'm so sorry that it went like that. And thank you for sharing<br>
 that, and that was the most difficult thing to -<br>

I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really<br>
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I<br>
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just<br>
 going into those in more detail.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,<br>
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It<br>
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in<br>
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was<br>
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we<br>
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a<br>
 breather, she's, &quot;No, we got to talk because we have to talk.&quot; And so that<br>
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,<br>
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I<br>
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the<br>
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of<br>
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off<br>
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into<br>
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,<br>
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going<br>
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from<br>
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have<br>
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're<br>
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck<br>
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we<br>
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we<br>
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to<br>
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I<br>
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put<br>
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we<br>
 were literally tugging at the car seat.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in<br>
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, &quot;You know what, I need you to sit<br>
 down and help me.&quot; Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want<br>
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need<br>
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two<br>
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the<br>
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they<br>
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts<br>
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: How old were you?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never<br>
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out<br>
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I<br>
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two<br>
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the<br>
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the<br>
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told<br>
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off<br>
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't<br>
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's<br>
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,<br>
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they<br>
 would've showed up then, anyways—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: No, I‚<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I<br>
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have<br>
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, &quot;Take my kids, go watch<br>
 TV and just keep them entertained.&quot; So my wife took off, me and my kids<br>
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around<br>
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I<br>
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid<br>
 attention to my little baby and she said, &quot;She has a bruise.&quot; And I asked<br>
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her<br>
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, &quot;My<br>
 little baby got hurt, something happened.&quot; I didn’t tell my mom at the time<br>
 what had happened, and then I told her, &quot;What do I do?&quot; And she said,<br>
 &quot;Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.&quot;<br>
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers<br>
 were on me. They asked me, &quot;Where's the mother?&quot; And I told her, &quot;Well, the<br>
 mother's not here.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: &quot;Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this<br>
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the<br>
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because<br>
 we have people that are waiting for you.&quot; As soon as I got to the hospital,<br>
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running<br>
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little<br>
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very<br>
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already<br>
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,<br>
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control<br>
 the situation or calm it down.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my<br>
 side of the story. She said, &quot;The little baby got hurt, I have four<br>
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars.&quot; My wife got there, they asked<br>
 her what happened and she said, &quot;It was his fault.&quot; This was around 1:00 AM<br>
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout<br>
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to<br>
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she<br>
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to<br>
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they<br>
 said, &quot;You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the<br>
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for<br>
 your arrest.&quot; And I told them, &quot;Okay, well hold on. What's going on?&quot; And<br>
 they said, &quot;We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little<br>
 baby.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I told him, &quot;No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little<br>
 baby.&quot; And they said, &quot;Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give<br>
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to<br>
 go ahead and read you your rights.&quot; I didn't know what's going on, with<br>
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally<br>
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and<br>
 they told the police officer, &quot;No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't<br>
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them<br>
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.&quot;<br>
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next<br>
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout<br>
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already<br>
 went to my house and picked up my other children.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,<br>
 I called the police station and I told him, &quot;You know what? I need to know<br>
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's<br>
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I<br>
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,<br>
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something.&quot; And they<br>
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month<br>
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she<br>
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, &quot;Okay, well<br>
 what's next?&quot; And she said, &quot;I don't know son.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I told her, &quot;Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to<br>
 see what's going on.&quot; The next morning, I was on my way to the police<br>
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I<br>
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was<br>
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they<br>
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see<br>
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my<br>
 mom, &quot;Where's he at?&quot; And she said, &quot;He's walking to the police station as<br>
 we speak.&quot; Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.<br>
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,<br>
 and literally they greeted me with, &quot;Mr ____, how are you doing?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on<br>
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police<br>
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the<br>
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, &quot;Really? I'm literally<br>
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?&quot; And I was just the<br>
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me<br>
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out<br>
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't<br>
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the<br>
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their<br>
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense<br>
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the<br>
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, &quot;Who did<br>
 this?&quot; And I told her, &quot;You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works<br>
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare.&quot; Me and my mom went to the<br>
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to<br>
 think, &quot;Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the<br>
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my<br>
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that<br>
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type<br>
 of guilt.&quot; So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to<br>
 the hospital because he feels guilty.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,<br>
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I<br>
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I<br>
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years<br>
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25<br>
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all<br>
 until my lawyer said, &quot;This is where we're at. You want to protect your<br>
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,<br>
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out<br>
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,<br>
 and then—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Where are the kids?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to<br>
 trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they<br>
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.<br>
 So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.<br>
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I<br>
 said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,<br>
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever<br>
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,<br>
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an<br>
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,<br>
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road<br>
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.<br>
 But I ended up being deported.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound<br>
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm<br>
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like<br>
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not<br>
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US<br>
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're<br>
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and<br>
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that<br>
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in<br>
 these situations.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Exactly.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the<br>
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and<br>
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, &quot;Please don't,<br>
 you're not leaving with my children.&quot; Like, when you said you're in a toxic<br>
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where<br>
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical<br>
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she<br>
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There<br>
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the<br>
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit<br>
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I<br>
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my<br>
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget<br>
 that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm<br>
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, &quot;Okay,<br>
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.&quot; So at first, she started<br>
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon<br>
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps<br>
 anymore, you're out of control.&quot; I held her, she was facing the wall, she<br>
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go<br>
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her<br>
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting<br>
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,<br>
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go<br>
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she<br>
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the<br>
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.<br>
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them<br>
 down and I told them, &quot;Hey, you know what, this is what happened.&quot; They<br>
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of<br>
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only<br>
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span><span id="a264207f-85c4-4904-8d51-da64c79be2a7" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Lack of mental health resources">Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really<br>

 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: How old were you?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never<br>
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out<br>
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I<br>
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two<br>
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the<br>
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the<br>
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told<br>
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off<br>
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't<br>
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's<br>
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,<br>
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they<br>
 would've showed up then, anyways—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: No, I‚<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I<br>
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have<br>
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, &quot;Take my kids, go watch<br>
 TV and just keep them entertained.&quot; So my wife took off, me and my kids<br>
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around<br>
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I<br>
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid<br>
 attention to my little baby and she said, &quot;She has a bruise.&quot; And I asked<br>
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her<br>
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, &quot;My<br>
 little baby got hurt, something happened.&quot; I didn’t tell my mom at the time<br>
 what had happened, and then I told her, &quot;What do I do?&quot; And she said,<br>
 &quot;Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.&quot;<br>
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers<br>
 were on me. They asked me, &quot;Where's the mother?&quot; And I told her, &quot;Well, the<br>
 mother's not here.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: &quot;Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this<br>
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the<br>
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because<br>
 we have people that are waiting for you.&quot; As soon as I got to the hospital,<br>
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running<br>
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little<br>
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very<br>
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already<br>
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,<br>
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control<br>
 the situation or calm it down.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my<br>
 side of the story. She said, &quot;The little baby got hurt, I have four<br>
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars.&quot; My wife got there, they asked<br>
 her what happened and she said, &quot;It was his fault.&quot; This was around 1:00 AM<br>
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout<br>
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to<br>
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she<br>
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to<br>
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they<br>
 said, &quot;You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the<br>
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for<br>
 your arrest.&quot; And I told them, &quot;Okay, well hold on. What's going on?&quot; And<br>
 they said, &quot;We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little<br>
 baby.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I told him, &quot;No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little<br>
 baby.&quot; And they said, &quot;Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give<br>
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to<br>
 go ahead and read you your rights.&quot; I didn't know what's going on, with<br>
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally<br>
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and<br>
 they told the police officer, &quot;No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't<br>
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them<br>
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.&quot;<br>
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next<br>
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout<br>
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already<br>
 went to my house and picked up my other children.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,<br>
 I called the police station and I told him, &quot;You know what? I need to know<br>
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's<br>
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I<br>
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,<br>
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something.&quot; And they<br>
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month<br>
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she<br>
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, &quot;Okay, well<br>
 what's next?&quot; And she said, &quot;I don't know son.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I told her, &quot;Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to<br>
 see what's going on.&quot; The next morning, I was on my way to the police<br>
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I<br>
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was<br>
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they<br>
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see<br>
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my<br>
 mom, &quot;Where's he at?&quot; And she said, &quot;He's walking to the police station as<br>
 we speak.&quot; Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.<br>
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,<br>
 and literally they greeted me with, &quot;Mr ____, how are you doing?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on<br>
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police<br>
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the<br>
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, &quot;Really? I'm literally<br>
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?&quot; And I was just the<br>
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me<br>
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out<br>
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't<br>
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the<br>
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their<br>
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense<br>
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the<br>
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, &quot;Who did<br>
 this?&quot; And I told her, &quot;You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works<br>
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare.&quot; Me and my mom went to the<br>
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to<br>
 think, &quot;Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the<br>
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my<br>
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that<br>
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type<br>
 of guilt.&quot; So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to<br>
 the hospital because he feels guilty.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,<br>
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I<br>
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I<br>
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years<br>
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25<br>
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all<br>
 until my lawyer said, &quot;This is where we're at. You want to protect your<br>
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,<br>
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out<br>
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,<br>
 and then—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Where are the kids?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to<br>
 trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they<br>
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.<br>
 So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.<br>
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I<br>
 said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,<br>
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever<br>
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,<br>
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an<br>
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,<br>
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road<br>
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.<br>
 But I ended up being deported.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound<br>
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm<br>
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like<br>
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not<br>
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US<br>
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're<br>
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and<br>
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that<br>
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in<br>
 these situations.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Exactly.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the<br>
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and<br>
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, &quot;Please don't,<br>
 you're not leaving with my children.&quot; Like, when you said you're in a toxic<br>
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where<br>
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical<br>
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she<br>
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There<br>
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the<br>
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit<br>
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I<br>
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my<br>
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget<br>
 that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm<br>
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, &quot;Okay,<br>
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.&quot; So at first, she started<br>
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon<br>
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps<br>
 anymore, you're out of control.&quot; I held her, she was facing the wall, she<br>
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go<br>
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her<br>
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting<br>
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,<br>
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go<br>
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she<br>
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the<br>
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.<br>
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them<br>
 down and I told them, &quot;Hey, you know what, this is what happened.&quot; They<br>
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of<br>
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only<br>
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span><span id="e5f3d6a8-0324-4918-a1fc-86f19cf1ca8f" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="conflict">Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really<br>
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I<br>
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just<br>
 going into those in more detail.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,<br>
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It<br>
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in<br>
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was<br>
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we<br>
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a<br>
 breather, she's, &quot;No, we got to talk because we have to talk.&quot; And so that<br>
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,<br>
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I<br>
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the<br>
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of<br>
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off<br>
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into<br>
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,<br>
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going<br>
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from<br>
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have<br>
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're<br>
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck<br>
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we<br>
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we<br>
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to<br>
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I<br>
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put<br>
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we<br>
 were literally tugging at the car seat.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in<br>
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, &quot;You know what, I need you to sit<br>
 down and help me.&quot; Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want<br>
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need<br>
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two<br>
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the<br>
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they<br>
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts<br>
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: How old were you?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never<br>
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out<br>
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I<br>
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two<br>

 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's<br>
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,<br>
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they<br>
 would've showed up then, anyways—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: No, I‚<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I<br>
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have<br>
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?<br>

 were on me. They asked me, &quot;Where's the mother?&quot; And I told her, &quot;Well, the<br>

 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was<br>
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they<br>
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see<br>
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my<br>
 mom, &quot;Where's he at?&quot; And she said, &quot;He's walking to the police station as<br>
 we speak.&quot; Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.<br>
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,<br>
 and literally they greeted me with, &quot;Mr ____, how are you doing?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on<br>
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police<br>
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the<br>
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, &quot;Really? I'm literally<br>
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?&quot; And I was just the<br>
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me<br>
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out<br>
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't<br>
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the<br>
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their<br>
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense<br>
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the<br>
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, &quot;Who did<br>
 this?&quot; And I told her, &quot;You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works<br>
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare.&quot; Me and my mom went to the<br>
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to<br>
 think, &quot;Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the<br>
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my<br>
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that<br>
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type<br>
 of guilt.&quot; So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to<br>
 the hospital because he feels guilty.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,<br>
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I<br>
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I<br>
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years<br>
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25<br>
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all<br>
 until my lawyer said, &quot;This is where we're at. You want to protect your<br>
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,<br>
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out<br>
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,<br>
 and then—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Where are the kids?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to<br>
 trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they<br>
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.<br>
 So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.<br>
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I<br>
 said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,<br>
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever<br>
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,<br>
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an<br>
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,<br>
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road<br>
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.<br>
 But I ended up being deported.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound<br>
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm<br>
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like<br>
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not<br>
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US<br>
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're<br>
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and<br>
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that<br>
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in<br>
 these situations.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Exactly.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the<br>
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and<br>
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, &quot;Please don't,<br>
 you're not leaving with my children.&quot; Like, when you said you're in a toxic<br>
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where<br>
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical<br>
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she<br>
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There<br>
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the<br>
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit<br>
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I<br>
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my<br>
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget<br>
 that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm<br>
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, &quot;Okay,<br>
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.&quot; So at first, she started<br>
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon<br>
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps<br>
 anymore, you're out of control.&quot; I held her, she was facing the wall, she<br>
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go<br>
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her<br>
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting<br>
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,<br>
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go<br>
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she<br>
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the<br>
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.<br>
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them<br>
 down and I told them, &quot;Hey, you know what, this is what happened.&quot; They<br>
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of<br>
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only<br>
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving<br>
 around from there?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction<br>
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very<br>
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,<br>
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me<br>
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to<br>
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and<br>
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, &quot;Okay, you got the<br>
 job.&quot; And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would<br>
 call him offering jobs or—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, &quot;Okay, I might not be able to go<br>
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own<br>
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.&quot; And so being<br>
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were<br>
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son<br>
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be<br>
 like, &quot;Yeah, I know who you are.&quot; At first it was all like, &quot;Okay, who are<br>
 you?&quot; “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then<br>
 after a while it was, &quot;Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you<br>
 and we need you to pick our store back up.&quot; And so after that, that was my<br>
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just<br>
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me<br>
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,<br>
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start<br>
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your<br>
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had<br>
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?<br>
 Were you together?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had<br>
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a<br>
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point<br>
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,<br>
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many<br>
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age<br>
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.<br>
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I<br>
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a<br>
 father.”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'<br>
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got<br>
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to<br>
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.<br>
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something<br>
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It<br>
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make<br>
 it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you<br>
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security<br>
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than<br>
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,<br>
 or anything like that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there<br>
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: No.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: 16.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I<br>
 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,<br>
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know<br>
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you<br>
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the<br>
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Oh very.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly<br>
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's enough credit.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would<br>
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're<br>
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.<br>
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The<br>
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,<br>
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also<br>
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all<br>
 like, &quot;Okay, so who's in charge?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So that's when I said, &quot;Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to<br>
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it<br>
 and I got my name out there.<br>
      <br>

 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,<br>
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me<br>
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to<br>
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and<br>
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, &quot;Okay, you got the<br>
 job.&quot; And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would<br>
 call him offering jobs or—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, &quot;Okay, I might not be able to go<br>
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own<br>
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.&quot; And so being<br>
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were<br>
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son<br>
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be<br>
 like, &quot;Yeah, I know who you are.&quot; At first it was all like, &quot;Okay, who are<br>
 you?&quot; “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then<br>
 after a while it was, &quot;Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you<br>
 and we need you to pick our store back up.&quot; And so after that, that was my<br>
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just<br>
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me<br>
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,<br>
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start<br>
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your<br>
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had<br>
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?<br>
 Were you together?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had<br>
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a<br>
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point<br>
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,<br>
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many<br>
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age<br>
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.<br>
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I<br>
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a<br>
 father.”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'<br>
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got<br>
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to<br>
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.<br>
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something<br>
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It<br>
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make<br>
 it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you<br>
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security<br>
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than<br>
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,<br>
 or anything like that.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there<br>
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: No.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: 16.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I<br>
 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,<br>
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know<br>
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you<br>
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the<br>
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Oh very.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly<br>
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's enough credit.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would<br>
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're<br>
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.<br>
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The<br>
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,<br>
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also<br>
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all<br>
 like, &quot;Okay, so who's in charge?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: So that's when I said, &quot;Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to<br>
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it<br>
 and I got my name out there.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span><span id="6bad150e-c82e-4b03-a4cf-f593b3963a96" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="kitchen">Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you<br>
 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving<br>
 around from there?<br>

Growing up like, up until middle<br>
 school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.<br>
 There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading<br>
 teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching<br>
 wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the<br>
 book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah. So—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: In what grade?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I<br>
 feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're<br>
 saying I'm doing good.&quot; And I'm sorry, what was the question?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,<br>
 like refusing those opportunities.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I<br>
 got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front<br>
 of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on<br>
 Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point<br>
 where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate<br>
 inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran<br>
 around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that<br>
 risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get<br>
 deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: What was it about?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,<br>
 yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you<br>
 pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition<br>
 for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that<br>
 you can't go over.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that &quot;No, you can't.&quot;<br>
 Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working<br>
 for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,<br>
 what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time<br>
 staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.<br>
 So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of<br>
 the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that<br>
 work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior<br>
 year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on<br>

 Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I<br>
 got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front<br>
 of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on<br>
 Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point<br>
 where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate<br>
 inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran<br>
 around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that<br>
 risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get<br>
 deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: What was it about?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,<br>
 yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you<br>
 pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition<br>
 for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that<br>
 you can't go over.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that &quot;No, you can't.&quot;<br>
 Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working<br>
 for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,<br>
 what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time<br>
 staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.<br>
 So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of<br>
 the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that<br>
 work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior<br>
 year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on<br>
 it was basically work, work, work. And that was basically my life after<br>
 junior year—just work and work.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span><span id="a85299ff-5f7c-4448-b75f-73b0c4b9fad1" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="honors">Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle<br>
 school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.<br>
 There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading<br>
 teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching<br>
 wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the<br>
 book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yeah. So—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: In what grade?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I<br>
 feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're<br>
 saying I'm doing good.&quot; And I'm sorry, what was the question?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,<br>
 like refusing those opportunities.<br>
      <br>

 we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home<br>
 and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,<br>
 didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't<br>
 seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just<br>
 that mindset that, &quot;Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and<br>
 something bad might happen.&quot;<br>

 Angelo: The main thing was learning how to interact with others, because it<br>
 was very hard. I feel like an outsider so I wouldn't really go up to<br>
 people, I wouldn't go up to any other races. So it was very hard, I would<br>
 really stay to myself and to that just one friend. Even sports, I couldn't<br>
 do sports because I didn't feel like I fit in. I never felt like I fitted<br>
 it in. And throughout all my school experiences, I never felt like that<br>
 belong to me because there was many times where I had opportunities for my<br>
 academics to get awards or be presented with some stuff, but I was always<br>
 told &quot;No, you're not American so you can’t do that. And there's no way that<br>
 you're going to go to another state they're going deport you on the way<br>
 there, we're going to get pulled over.” And so, I really didn't see a<br>
 future there for me.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

 explicitly say, “You have no opportunity here?”<br>

 didn't know the language. There were many times where I would just cry. The<br>

 that was my closest friend. I was very young, so it was like I needed that,<br>

Is it just your day to day</br> interaction with people—like the way you felt othered—or did people</br> explicitly say, “You have no opportunity here?”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Mainly it was my parents. My parents wanted us to keep to</br> ourselves. My parents just raised us with that mentality that we're here,</br> we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home</br> and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,</br> didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't</br> seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just</br> that mindset that, &quot;Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and</br> something bad might happen.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So definitely…When I asked you the question, Do you fear the US</br> authorities, that was a dominant part of your childhood?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Most definitely. Going to the United States from Mexico my dad</br> still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had</br> to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending</br> because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left</br> alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many</br> times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or</br> I would have a friend that said, &quot;Let's go do this,&quot; I'll be, &quot;No, I'm</br> going to get in trouble.&quot; Or, &quot;No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from</br> here.&quot; And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had</br> Chicanos—which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that</br> were born there—and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was</br> always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, &quot;Oh I</br> have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback.&quot; And so that was</br> very, very, very difficult for me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did you have anyone to talk to about this or is this really</br> something that you just had to go through individually?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My sister, me and my sister—my sister's one year older than me—it</br> was basically me and her. If it was her being offered something, we would</br> just console each other. We would just tell each other, &quot;No, you did good.</br> It doesn't matter if you don't get the reward, it doesn't matter if you</br> don't get the prize, you did it, you got that mail certificate.&quot; So it was</br> just me and my sister.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So like in those situations, you might receive potential</br> opportunities but like, no, you can't pursue them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle</br> school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.</br> There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading</br> teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching</br> wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the</br> book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: In what grade?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I</br> feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're</br> saying I'm doing good.&quot; And I'm sorry, what was the question?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,</br> like refusing those opportunities.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I</br> got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front</br> of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on</br> Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point</br> where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate</br> inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran</br> around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that</br> risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get</br> deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was it about?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,</br> yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you</br> pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition</br> for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that</br> you can't go over.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that &quot;No, you can't.&quot;</br> Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working</br> for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,</br> what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time</br> staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.</br> So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of</br> the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that</br> work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior</br> year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on</br> it was basically work, work, work. And that was basically my life after</br> junior year—just work and work.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you</br> tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving</br> around from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction</br> and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very</br> physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,</br> he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me</br> along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to</br> want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and</br> literally just because I had his last name, it was, &quot;Okay, you got the</br> job.&quot; And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would</br> call him offering jobs or—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, &quot;Okay, I might not be able to go</br> to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own</br> kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.&quot; And so being</br> under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were</br> points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son</br> anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be</br> like, &quot;Yeah, I know who you are.&quot; At first it was all like, &quot;Okay, who are</br> you?&quot; “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then</br> after a while it was, &quot;Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you</br> and we need you to pick our store back up.&quot; And so after that, that was my</br> goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just</br> because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me</br> learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,</br> that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start</br> pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your</br> father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had</br> to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?</br> Were you together?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had</br> legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a</br> little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point</br> where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,</br> so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many</br> times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age</br> of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.</br> And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I</br> could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a</br> father.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'</br> house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got</br> my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to</br> support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.</br> So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something</br> bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It</br> was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make</br> it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you</br> were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security</br> cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than</br> what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,</br> or anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there</br> know that you were undocumented or that are younger?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 16.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I</br> Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,</br> and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know</br> you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you</br> work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the</br> other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Oh very.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Very much like more high end?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly</br> young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's enough credit.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would</br> get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're</br> at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.</br> And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The</br> reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,</br> and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also</br> be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all</br> like, &quot;Okay, so who's in charge?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that's when I said, &quot;Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to</br> do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it</br> and I got my name out there.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really</br> making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I</br> guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just</br> going into those in more detail.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,</br> 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It</br> was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in</br> the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was</br> that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we</br> weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a</br> breather, she's, &quot;No, we got to talk because we have to talk.&quot; And so that</br> day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,</br> she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I</br> saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Swooped up the baby?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the</br> floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of</br> stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off</br> with my kids—I love my kids to death.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into</br> elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,</br> because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going</br> to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from</br> school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have</br> problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're</br> going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck</br> together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we</br> didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we</br> loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to</br> take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I</br> called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put</br> her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we</br> were literally tugging at the car seat.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in</br> a car seat. I told my little brothers, &quot;You know what, I need you to sit</br> down and help me.&quot; Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want</br> anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need</br> you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two</br> brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the</br> other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they</br> told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts</br> your hands on each other, then you can call us.”</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never</br> came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out</br> of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I</br> had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two</br> daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the</br> toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the</br> back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told</br> them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off</br> with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't</br> want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's</br> crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,</br> something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they</br> would've showed up then, anyways—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, I‚</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I</br> called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have</br> ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, &quot;Take my kids, go watch</br> TV and just keep them entertained.&quot; So my wife took off, me and my kids</br> spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around</br> seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I</br> was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid</br> attention to my little baby and she said, &quot;She has a bruise.&quot; And I asked</br> her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her</br> ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, &quot;My</br> little baby got hurt, something happened.&quot; I didn’t tell my mom at the time</br> what had happened, and then I told her, &quot;What do I do?&quot; And she said,</br> &quot;Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.&quot;</br> We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers</br> were on me. They asked me, &quot;Where's the mother?&quot; And I told her, &quot;Well, the</br> mother's not here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: &quot;Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this</br> is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the</br> hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because</br> we have people that are waiting for you.&quot; As soon as I got to the hospital,</br> I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running</br> around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little</br> city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very</br> little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already</br> gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,</br> there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control</br> the situation or calm it down.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my</br> side of the story. She said, &quot;The little baby got hurt, I have four</br> children, I'm going to put you behind bars.&quot; My wife got there, they asked</br> her what happened and she said, &quot;It was his fault.&quot; This was around 1:00 AM</br> in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout</br> the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to</br> lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she</br> didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to</br> take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they</br> said, &quot;You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the</br> hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for</br> your arrest.&quot; And I told them, &quot;Okay, well hold on. What's going on?&quot; And</br> they said, &quot;We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little</br> baby.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told him, &quot;No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little</br> baby.&quot; And they said, &quot;Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give</br> you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to</br> go ahead and read you your rights.&quot; I didn't know what's going on, with</br> them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally</br> scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and</br> they told the police officer, &quot;No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't</br> have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them</br> a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.&quot;</br> So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next</br> morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout</br> the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already</br> went to my house and picked up my other children.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,</br> I called the police station and I told him, &quot;You know what? I need to know</br> whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's</br> going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I</br> don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,</br> I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something.&quot; And they</br> told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month</br> waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she</br> told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, &quot;Okay, well</br> what's next?&quot; And she said, &quot;I don't know son.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told her, &quot;Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to</br> see what's going on.&quot; The next morning, I was on my way to the police</br> station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I</br> was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was</br> walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they</br> hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see</br> me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my</br> mom, &quot;Where's he at?&quot; And she said, &quot;He's walking to the police station as</br> we speak.&quot; Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.</br> They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,</br> and literally they greeted me with, &quot;Mr ____, how are you doing?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on</br> their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police</br> station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the</br> neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, &quot;Really? I'm literally</br> in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?&quot; And I was just the</br> biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me</br> that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out</br> that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't</br> sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the</br> hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their</br> police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense</br> whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the</br> detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, &quot;Who did</br> this?&quot; And I told her, &quot;You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works</br> for the state. My mom has her own daycare.&quot; Me and my mom went to the</br> clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to</br> think, &quot;Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the</br> baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my</br> baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that</br> you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type</br> of guilt.&quot; So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to</br> the hospital because he feels guilty.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,</br> there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I</br> presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I</br> was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years</br> or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25</br> years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all</br> until my lawyer said, &quot;This is where we're at. You want to protect your</br> wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,</br> you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out</br> her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,</br> and then—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Where are the kids?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to</br> trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they</br> said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.</br> So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.</br> You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I</br> said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,</br> I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever</br> she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,</br> I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an</br> immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,</br> immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road</br> ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.</br> But I ended up being deported.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound</br> exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm</br> carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like</br> there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not</br> being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US</br> authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're</br> undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and</br> paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that</br> they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in</br> these situations.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the</br> altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and</br> she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, &quot;Please don't,</br> you're not leaving with my children.&quot; Like, when you said you're in a toxic</br> relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where</br> she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical</br> because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she</br> literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There</br> was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the</br> door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit</br> me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I</br> grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my</br> dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget</br> that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm</br> never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, &quot;Okay,</br> that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.&quot; So at first, she started</br> slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon</br> as she punched me in my eye, I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps</br> anymore, you're out of control.&quot; I held her, she was facing the wall, she</br> bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go</br> and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her</br> lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting</br> up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,</br> “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go</br> to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she</br> picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the</br> phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.</br> I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them</br> down and I told them, &quot;Hey, you know what, this is what happened.&quot; They</br> took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of</br> the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only</br> point it ever got to a physical altercation.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Just in the moment when your baby fell off the bed, was she pushed</br> back onto the bed and then that—</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was because of that same reason that she did not let me leave</br> the room. And so I got her, and I moved her away from the door. I literally</br> got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That is just such a tragic…Like it's the worst way that could have</br> gone. Again, I'm so sorry that it went like that. And thank you for sharing</br> that, and that was the most difficult thing to -</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No, it's actually the very first time that I've been able to tell</br> this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to</br> embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s</br> Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids</br> literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My</br> first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw</br> lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I</br> was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke</br> down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I</br> used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I</br> walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult</br> mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to</br> say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,</br> for all that work to just be taken away just like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,</br> being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own</br> father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from</br> that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a</br> father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that</br> you never wanted to be.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was</br> the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me</br> and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want</br> to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my</br> kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.</br> I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are</br> they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you</br> had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,</br> socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on</br> your return?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent</br> the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't</br> want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and</br> I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, &quot;Will I get in trouble</br> if I walk around the streets with the beer?&quot; And she said, &quot;You'll be fine.</br> You have two or 300 pesos, right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah I just came back from the</br> United States, I have money.&quot; “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,</br> just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very</br> first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my</br> family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, well it's in my</br> blood. Let's go for it.&quot; And literally there will be times where I would</br> just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice</br> and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about</br> half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a</br> lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on</br> my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the</br> door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just</br> literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just</br> [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they</br> literally—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Who’s everybody?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family</br> sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They</br> literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because</br> just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it</br> was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,</br> very first time. So I told myself, &quot;How do you not remember this happening?</br> How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What</br> did you do?&quot; And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,</br> that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United</br> States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times</br> where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and</br> literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,</br> that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because</br> for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the</br> middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around</br> the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the</br> street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted</br> somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling</br> me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,</br> and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a</br> big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any</br> of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there</br> she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,</br> she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she</br> was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.</br> So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, &quot;You know what,</br> your son is doing this&quot; [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and</br> that's when I said, I told my mom, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my</br> father did, so I'm done.&quot; And that was it. That's when I said, &quot;I'm not</br> going to do this again to my mom.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And that was kind of like your early experience, kind of struggling</br> to be back in Mexico and come to terms with not being with your family. So</br> where did you go from there, not only just job wise but, also, how long</br> have you been back? And like what's been going on since then?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, from there they said I needed some time for myself to think.</br> So I got offered a trip to Cancun, they paid for a month for me to be in</br> Cancun. And literally I just vacationed and spend some time there. And I</br> went with a cousin and we literally had so much fun that I said, &quot;You know</br> what, maybe things will be alright. From the difference of coming here to</br> the state of Mexico and going to Cancun, Cancun was more lifestyle of what</br> I was used to, more English, everything was so pretty. So I was like,</br> &quot;Okay, well they have places like this in Mexico, so maybe I could do this,</br> maybe I could bring my kids down here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And I spent a month in Cancun. And from there I came back to the</br> city and I tried Uber. It was very difficult for me because I didn't know</br> the traffic, how it worked. Literally all the speed bumps, I would pass</br> over them going very fast and people would freak out, but I would just</br> always tell them, &quot;You know what, over there in the United States, they'll</br> let you know if the speed bumps are coming&quot; [Both laugh]. And so, I wasn't</br> able to do Uber; I got kicked out of Uber. I tried doing my studies, that</br> was very difficult and I'm still not able to do it because they won't</br> validate my credits that I have from high school. They said that I have to</br> go literally start from elementary all the way up. So I couldn't continue</br> with my schools.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That got put on pause. And so I started visiting Mexico City. I</br> started walking around Mexico City, the nice areas and that's when I</br> started learning about these call centers. I applied for a call center, and</br> it seemed all right money, compared to what everybody else was making. And,</br> you know, it wasn't anywhere close to what I was making the United States,</br> but for this lifestyle of me in Mexico City, it was all right. And that was</br> difficult for me as well because I lived in the state. And so I would have</br> to transport three, four hours to get to my job. I would have to wake up at</br> 4:00 in the morning and get to my job at 8:00 in the morning. And I'd come</br> home at 11:00, 12:00 at night.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that went on for about four or five months until I literally</br> said, “I can't do this anymore.” I resigned from AT&amp;amp;T, and I've</br> literally been stuck since then besides from my mom giving me what she</br> can—my mom doesn't work so the main income is from my father. Me and my</br> father not having that awesome relationship, I feel shameful asking for him</br> for anything. So, there'd be times where my mom would send me $10, $20, and</br> literally got me two or three days, and that's literally how it's been</br> going on for past couple of months.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Until recently I was staying with family, and one thing led to</br> another—my aunt from the United States visited and she did not like how</br> things were going for me. She said, &quot;You're just sitting around, and you</br> have no need to work because people are sending you money, so I'm going to</br> give you a need to work.&quot; [Chuckles]. And she kicked me out. And literally</br> that was two days ago. So that's where I found New Comienzos. I've been</br> running around trying to try to get help because literally right now, I'm</br> on my own. I literally had to break down to my dad. I broke down, and I</br> told him, &quot;I need your help. I need you to be there.&quot; And he heard me, and</br> so just yesterday I got my apartment, and, you know, moving forward.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I understand how you would really not want to ask anything</br> from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped</br> one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s</br> important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for</br> detention for two months?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Two months. Do you mind just touching on the conditions or like the</br> treatment you experienced there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the</br> immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things</br> breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary</br> was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,</br> they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their</br> case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,</br> citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask</br> them, &quot;If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, &quot;Well,</br> you know, they deport you tomorrow.&quot; And I called my dad and I told him,</br> &quot;Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be</br> here. I'll sign my deportation.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that</br> to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge</br> and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and</br> you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're</br> considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact</br> words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,</br> &quot;Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my</br> brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this.&quot; And</br> it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no</br> emotion with him. It was, &quot;No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.</br> But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So it was like, &quot;Why are you giving me the option to fight my case</br> if...[Sigh]&quot; So I told him, &quot;Okay, well let's sign.&quot; And literally the next</br> day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be</br> there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and</br> literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on</br> their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, &quot;If they can't</br> do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?&quot; And that</br> was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't</br> be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.</br> I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way</br> of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had</br> to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want</br> anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a</br> father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be</br> imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there</br> will be a lot of guards that would tell me, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And</br> there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,</br> &quot;Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his</br> rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a</br> criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal.&quot; And it was just so</br> hard for me to stay focused on, &quot;No, you got to get out of this, you're</br> going to get out of this.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just</br> explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much</br> on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called</br> something, it was just put your head down and, &quot;Okay, no, you're right.&quot;</br> And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in</br> immigration. It was just that, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And there was</br> nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it</br> was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,</br> do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the</br> way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself</br> and I didn't mess what anybody.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: If things had gone a different way, and that moment that you</br> describe hadn't happened, what do you think you would be doing, like what</br> would be your dreams to do in the United States?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: To have my store, to have my restaurants. I want my restaurant and</br> I still want it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What would you call it?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: All styles, all around the world restaurant. That's what I want,</br> all around the world restaurant. Something from every place. And that's</br> what I wanted to, I want to travel the world, I want to learn every single</br> style of cooking. I got Italian down, I got American style down, and I had</br> a little bit of the London, English, all that. And I just want to keep</br> learning, and I want to expand my portfolio, I want to learn as much as</br> there is, and that's my dream one day to have my own store, maybe here in</br> Mexico—most definitely here in Mexico because I really don't see any</br> chances for me to go back.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's your plan for Mexico too, or your dream?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My dream to have my own store. That's my dream, that's my goal, to</br> have my own restaurant, that's my passion. I love the reaction from the</br> clients and I just love making good food.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's awesome. Well, I hope you pursue that dream. Just some</br> general questions that we like to touch on, you can take them whichever</br> direction you want. Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American or do</br> you consider yourself Mexican or American?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: American.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: American, 100%?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 100% American.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking</br> around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].</br> So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I</br> talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I</br> guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it</br> and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and</br> down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't</br> belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and</br> I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much</br> all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all</br> that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal</br> ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in</br> America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was</br> some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Despite your own experience with the US justice system, you have</br> like a larger faith that it is still like less corrupt than Mexico. Is that</br> kind of what you're saying?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, it's very difficult because in the United States, when I</br> would think about corruptions or anything like that, I think about families</br> getting separated, all this stuff that's going on now with the news, with</br> the President. Those are the bad things that I see up at the United States,</br> about just this one guy has a problem with -- had an argument with one</br> Mexican one day and it ruined his image for the rest of his life, and now a</br> whole country has to has to suffer because of that. And I feel like the</br> corruption here in Mexico is more inside of Mexico, more of being corrupt</br> here and not having to do anything with any other countries or anything</br> like that. But I do feel like there could've been more done.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: There could have been more people that heard my story, there could</br> have been... Somebody should have said this is not right. Somebody</br> should've said the police report is not right. I promise anybody could read</br> the police report and it makes no sense, it makes no sense whatsoever. And</br> I just feel like somebody could have said, &quot;Well, hold on, this makes no</br> sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened.&quot; But it was never,</br> &quot;Okay, what happened?&quot; It was always, &quot;Okay, you did this.&quot; So that's where</br> I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had</br> no voice—and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the</br> bad guy because a little baby got hurt.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were</br> people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said</br> something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,</br> &quot;You know what, he did something,&quot; it was, &quot;You're going to jail,&quot; just</br> because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,</br> and just hearing all these stories, I was like, &quot;There's no way that I'm</br> going to get past this.&quot; And literally the very first offer was 30 years.</br> 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had</br> to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was</br> not me, I wasn't what they had on paper. I was not that person, I was</br> different, I was completely—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Opposite of the criminals that you were surrounded by?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly. And just hearing all these stories of people going through</br> things in jail of all these things, I told myself, &quot;Why are you here then?</br> You're not supposed to be here. Why am I still here after six months? Why</br> am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing</br> for some time?&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going</br> to go home, you're going to see your mom.&quot; And then out of nowhere you get</br> this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, &quot;No, no, no, no,</br> no, no, no, no. That's not what's supposed to be happening. No.&quot; And so it</br> was like literally the world ended, and everything was taken just so fast.</br> The only things that I have left is pictures just because of the situation</br> that happened, I am not on good terms with the mother of my kids. And all</br> I'm left with is pictures and just memories and that's the hardest. Not</br> being able to just have some type of context, some type of pictures, or</br> recent pictures and updates, something, something, something, it's very</br> hard.</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="4b4a2913-e585-4dab-86f7-bd30294860e3" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Feelings, Dreams">.Isabel: (pause) Is there anything else you would like to reflect on or you<br>
 people to know like before we wrap up?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: I plan to have a future, I'm going to have a future, and it's not<br>
 going to stop me. It's been hard, the past couple of years have been hard,<br>
 but I still have kids. I want them to be here, so this is not going to stop<br>
 me.<br>

      <br>
 Angelo: Well, it was really to the point that my dad wasn't doing anything<br>
 productive here in Mexico. We were staying in a one-bedroom house with my<br>

</span> Isabel: And you mentioned you were young, four years old, and you were</br> given something to go to sleep throughout the car ride, could you then</br> maybe trace back to your earliest memories in the US, like what you do</br> remember?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My earliest memories in the US would be probably me seeing</br> sunlight, because I remember we were in a trunk at one point. And my family</br> tells the story as a joke, I guess it. But it seems that they forgot us in</br> the trunk for a little while. So yeah, that would be my earliest memories</br> of you know, me being in the United States, getting out of the trunk and</br> going to Walmart, trying to buy clothes, and just seeing everything brand</br> new, everything was completely different. Honestly, that's the only thing</br> that I can remember because I really don't have much memories of me being</br> young not even here in Mexico. I can't remember.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean, it's really hard to pull back on those memories. From</br> the ones that you're more sure of like going into school, any friends or</br> teachers that stood out?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I remember going to school, it was very scary for me because I</br> didn't know the language. There were many times where I would just cry. The</br> teachers would try to comfort me, but I would just scream—I didn't know</br> what was going on. Even times when I was in pain, I couldn't tell anybody</br> what was going on. So it was very difficult. I did have one friend, and</br> that was my closest friend. I was very young, so it was like I needed that,</br> to have somebody support me. You know, obviously my parents were there, but</br> maybe they spent more time trying to get them situated, and not really</br> introducing us to the American life. So it was, basically go to school,</br> you're on your own and then come back in your home. So it was basically</br> like I had to learn everything by myself.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What did you have to learn? What was picking up the different</br> cultural experiences like?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: The main thing was learning how to interact with others, because it</br> was very hard. I feel like an outsider so I wouldn't really go up to</br> people, I wouldn't go up to any other races. So it was very hard, I would</br> really stay to myself and to that just one friend. Even sports, I couldn't</br> do sports because I didn't feel like I fit in. I never felt like I fitted</br> it in. And throughout all my school experiences, I never felt like that</br> belong to me because there was many times where I had opportunities for my</br> academics to get awards or be presented with some stuff, but I was always</br> told &quot;No, you're not American so you can’t do that. And there's no way that</br> you're going to go to another state they're going deport you on the way</br> there, we're going to get pulled over.” And so, I really didn't see a</br> future there for me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Where was that message coming from? Is it just your day to day</br> interaction with people—like the way you felt othered—or did people</br> explicitly say, “You have no opportunity here?”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Mainly it was my parents. My parents wanted us to keep to</br> ourselves. My parents just raised us with that mentality that we're here,</br> we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home</br> and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,</br> didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't</br> seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just</br> that mindset that, &quot;Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and</br> something bad might happen.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So definitely…When I asked you the question, Do you fear the US</br> authorities, that was a dominant part of your childhood?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Most definitely. Going to the United States from Mexico my dad</br> still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had</br> to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending</br> because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left</br> alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many</br> times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or</br> I would have a friend that said, &quot;Let's go do this,&quot; I'll be, &quot;No, I'm</br> going to get in trouble.&quot; Or, &quot;No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from</br> here.&quot; And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had</br> Chicanos—which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that</br> were born there—and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was</br> always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, &quot;Oh I</br> have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback.&quot; And so that was</br> very, very, very difficult for me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did you have anyone to talk to about this or is this really</br> something that you just had to go through individually?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My sister, me and my sister—my sister's one year older than me—it</br> was basically me and her. If it was her being offered something, we would</br> just console each other. We would just tell each other, &quot;No, you did good.</br> It doesn't matter if you don't get the reward, it doesn't matter if you</br> don't get the prize, you did it, you got that mail certificate.&quot; So it was</br> just me and my sister.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So like in those situations, you might receive potential</br> opportunities but like, no, you can't pursue them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle</br> school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.</br> There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading</br> teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching</br> wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the</br> book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: In what grade?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I</br> feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're</br> saying I'm doing good.&quot; And I'm sorry, what was the question?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,</br> like refusing those opportunities.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I</br> got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front</br> of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on</br> Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point</br> where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate</br> inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran</br> around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that</br> risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get</br> deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was it about?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,</br> yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you</br> pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition</br> for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that</br> you can't go over.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that &quot;No, you can't.&quot;</br> Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working</br> for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,</br> what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time</br> staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.</br> So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of</br> the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that</br> work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior</br> year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on</br> it was basically work, work, work. And that was basically my life after</br> junior year—just work and work.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you</br> tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving</br> around from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction</br> and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very</br> physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,</br> he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me</br> along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to</br> want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and</br> literally just because I had his last name, it was, &quot;Okay, you got the</br> job.&quot; And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would</br> call him offering jobs or—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, &quot;Okay, I might not be able to go</br> to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own</br> kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.&quot; And so being</br> under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were</br> points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son</br> anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be</br> like, &quot;Yeah, I know who you are.&quot; At first it was all like, &quot;Okay, who are</br> you?&quot; “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then</br> after a while it was, &quot;Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you</br> and we need you to pick our store back up.&quot; And so after that, that was my</br> goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just</br> because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me</br> learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,</br> that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start</br> pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your</br> father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had</br> to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?</br> Were you together?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had</br> legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a</br> little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point</br> where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,</br> so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many</br> times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age</br> of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.</br> And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I</br> could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a</br> father.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'</br> house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got</br> my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to</br> support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.</br> So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something</br> bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It</br> was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make</br> it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you</br> were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security</br> cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than</br> what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,</br> or anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there</br> know that you were undocumented or that are younger?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 16.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I</br> Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,</br> and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know</br> you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you</br> work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the</br> other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Oh very.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Very much like more high end?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly</br> young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's enough credit.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would</br> get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're</br> at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.</br> And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The</br> reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,</br> and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also</br> be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all</br> like, &quot;Okay, so who's in charge?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that's when I said, &quot;Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to</br> do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it</br> and I got my name out there.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really</br> making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I</br> guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just</br> going into those in more detail.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,</br> 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It</br> was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in</br> the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was</br> that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we</br> weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a</br> breather, she's, &quot;No, we got to talk because we have to talk.&quot; And so that</br> day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,</br> she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I</br> saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Swooped up the baby?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the</br> floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of</br> stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off</br> with my kids—I love my kids to death.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into</br> elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,</br> because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going</br> to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from</br> school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have</br> problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're</br> going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck</br> together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we</br> didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we</br> loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to</br> take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I</br> called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put</br> her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we</br> were literally tugging at the car seat.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in</br> a car seat. I told my little brothers, &quot;You know what, I need you to sit</br> down and help me.&quot; Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want</br> anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need</br> you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two</br> brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the</br> other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they</br> told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts</br> your hands on each other, then you can call us.”</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never</br> came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out</br> of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I</br> had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two</br> daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the</br> toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the</br> back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told</br> them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off</br> with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't</br> want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's</br> crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,</br> something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they</br> would've showed up then, anyways—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, I‚</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I</br> called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have</br> ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, &quot;Take my kids, go watch</br> TV and just keep them entertained.&quot; So my wife took off, me and my kids</br> spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around</br> seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I</br> was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid</br> attention to my little baby and she said, &quot;She has a bruise.&quot; And I asked</br> her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her</br> ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, &quot;My</br> little baby got hurt, something happened.&quot; I didn’t tell my mom at the time</br> what had happened, and then I told her, &quot;What do I do?&quot; And she said,</br> &quot;Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.&quot;</br> We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers</br> were on me. They asked me, &quot;Where's the mother?&quot; And I told her, &quot;Well, the</br> mother's not here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: &quot;Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this</br> is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the</br> hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because</br> we have people that are waiting for you.&quot; As soon as I got to the hospital,</br> I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running</br> around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little</br> city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very</br> little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already</br> gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,</br> there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control</br> the situation or calm it down.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my</br> side of the story. She said, &quot;The little baby got hurt, I have four</br> children, I'm going to put you behind bars.&quot; My wife got there, they asked</br> her what happened and she said, &quot;It was his fault.&quot; This was around 1:00 AM</br> in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout</br> the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to</br> lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she</br> didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to</br> take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they</br> said, &quot;You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the</br> hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for</br> your arrest.&quot; And I told them, &quot;Okay, well hold on. What's going on?&quot; And</br> they said, &quot;We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little</br> baby.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told him, &quot;No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little</br> baby.&quot; And they said, &quot;Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give</br> you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to</br> go ahead and read you your rights.&quot; I didn't know what's going on, with</br> them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally</br> scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and</br> they told the police officer, &quot;No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't</br> have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them</br> a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.&quot;</br> So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next</br> morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout</br> the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already</br> went to my house and picked up my other children.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,</br> I called the police station and I told him, &quot;You know what? I need to know</br> whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's</br> going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I</br> don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,</br> I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something.&quot; And they</br> told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month</br> waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she</br> told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, &quot;Okay, well</br> what's next?&quot; And she said, &quot;I don't know son.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told her, &quot;Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to</br> see what's going on.&quot; The next morning, I was on my way to the police</br> station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I</br> was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was</br> walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they</br> hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see</br> me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my</br> mom, &quot;Where's he at?&quot; And she said, &quot;He's walking to the police station as</br> we speak.&quot; Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.</br> They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,</br> and literally they greeted me with, &quot;Mr ____, how are you doing?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on</br> their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police</br> station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the</br> neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, &quot;Really? I'm literally</br> in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?&quot; And I was just the</br> biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me</br> that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out</br> that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't</br> sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the</br> hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their</br> police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense</br> whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the</br> detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, &quot;Who did</br> this?&quot; And I told her, &quot;You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works</br> for the state. My mom has her own daycare.&quot; Me and my mom went to the</br> clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to</br> think, &quot;Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the</br> baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my</br> baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that</br> you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type</br> of guilt.&quot; So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to</br> the hospital because he feels guilty.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,</br> there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I</br> presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I</br> was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years</br> or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25</br> years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all</br> until my lawyer said, &quot;This is where we're at. You want to protect your</br> wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,</br> you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out</br> her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,</br> and then—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Where are the kids?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to</br> trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they</br> said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.</br> So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.</br> You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I</br> said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,</br> I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever</br> she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,</br> I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an</br> immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,</br> immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road</br> ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.</br> But I ended up being deported.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound</br> exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm</br> carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like</br> there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not</br> being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US</br> authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're</br> undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and</br> paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that</br> they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in</br> these situations.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the</br> altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and</br> she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, &quot;Please don't,</br> you're not leaving with my children.&quot; Like, when you said you're in a toxic</br> relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where</br> she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical</br> because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she</br> literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There</br> was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the</br> door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit</br> me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I</br> grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my</br> dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget</br> that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm</br> never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, &quot;Okay,</br> that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.&quot; So at first, she started</br> slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon</br> as she punched me in my eye, I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps</br> anymore, you're out of control.&quot; I held her, she was facing the wall, she</br> bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go</br> and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her</br> lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting</br> up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,</br> “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go</br> to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she</br> picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the</br> phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.</br> I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them</br> down and I told them, &quot;Hey, you know what, this is what happened.&quot; They</br> took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of</br> the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only</br> point it ever got to a physical altercation.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Just in the moment when your baby fell off the bed, was she pushed</br> back onto the bed and then that—</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was because of that same reason that she did not let me leave</br> the room. And so I got her, and I moved her away from the door. I literally</br> got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That is just such a tragic…Like it's the worst way that could have</br> gone. Again, I'm so sorry that it went like that. And thank you for sharing</br> that, and that was the most difficult thing to -</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No, it's actually the very first time that I've been able to tell</br> this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to</br> embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s</br> Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids</br> literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My</br> first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw</br> lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I</br> was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke</br> down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I</br> used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I</br> walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult</br> mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to</br> say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,</br> for all that work to just be taken away just like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,</br> being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own</br> father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from</br> that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a</br> father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that</br> you never wanted to be.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly. <span id="02b7370f-7de2-4818-bc56-71049eb610cd" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Children, Regret, Reflections">And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was<br>
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me<br>
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want<br>
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my<br>
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.<br>
 I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are<br>
 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.<br>
      <br>

 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to<br>
 trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they<br>
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.<br>
 So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.<br>
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I<br>
 said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,<br>
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever<br>
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,<br>
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an<br>
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,<br>
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road<br>
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.<br>
 But I ended up being deported.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span><span id="03175b6a-c25d-4414-8d7c-0b5484b6f2dd" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Economic, The United States">Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction<br>
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very<br>
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,<br>
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me<br>
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to<br>
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and<br>
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, &quot;Okay, you got the<br>
 job.&quot; And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would<br>
 call him offering jobs or—<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, &quot;Okay, I might not be able to go<br>
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own<br>
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.&quot; And so being<br>
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were<br>
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son<br>
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be<br>
 like, &quot;Yeah, I know who you are.&quot; At first it was all like, &quot;Okay, who are<br>
 you?&quot; “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then<br>
 after a while it was, &quot;Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you<br>
 and we need you to pick our store back up.&quot; And so after that, that was my<br>
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span><span id="29717e62-38e6-4ea9-993f-e093a22837c0" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Living undocumented">And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I<br>
 got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front<br>
 of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on<br>
 Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point<br>
 where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate<br>
 inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran<br>
 around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that<br>
 risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get<br>
 deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.<br>

 school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.<br>
 There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading<br>
 teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching<br>
 wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the<br>
 book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.<br>

</span><span id="dd3beca0-936a-4a3d-9db0-4d57940a8d0a" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Living undocumented, Discrimination">Angelo: Most definitely. Going to the United States from Mexico my dad<br>
 still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had<br>
 to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending<br>
 because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left<br>
 alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many<br>
 times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or<br>
 I would have a friend that said, &quot;Let's go do this,&quot; I'll be, &quot;No, I'm<br>
 going to get in trouble.&quot; Or, &quot;No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from<br>
 here.&quot; And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had<br>
 Chicanos—which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that<br>
 were born there—and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was<br>
 always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, &quot;Oh I<br>
 have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback.&quot; And so that was<br>
 very, very, very difficult for me.<br>
      <br>
      <br>

 didn't know the language. There were many times where I would just cry. The<br>
 teachers would try to comfort me, but I would just scream—I didn't know<br>
 what was going on. Even times when I was in pain, I couldn't tell anybody<br>
 what was going on. So it was very difficult. I did have one friend, and<br>
 that was my closest friend. I was very young, so it was like I needed that,<br>
 to have somebody support me. You know, obviously my parents were there, but<br>
 maybe they spent more time trying to get them situated, and not really<br>
 introducing us to the American life. So it was, basically go to school,<br>
 you're on your own and then come back in your home. So it was basically<br>
 like I had to learn everything by myself.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Isabel: What did you have to learn? What was picking up the different</br> cultural experiences like?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: The main thing was learning how to interact with others, because it</br> was very hard. I feel like an outsider so I wouldn't really go up to</br> people, I wouldn't go up to any other races. So it was very hard, I would</br> really stay to myself and to that just one friend. Even sports, I couldn't</br> do sports because I didn't feel like I fit in. I never felt like I fitted</br> it in. And throughout all my school experiences, I never felt like that</br> belong to me because there was many times where I had opportunities for my</br> academics to get awards or be presented with some stuff, but I was always</br> told &quot;No, you're not American so you can’t do that. And there's no way that</br> you're going to go to another state they're going deport you on the way</br> there, we're going to get pulled over.” And so, I really didn't see a</br> future there for me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Where was that message coming from? Is it just your day to day</br> interaction with people—like the way you felt othered—or did people</br> explicitly say, “You have no opportunity here?”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Mainly it was my parents. My parents wanted us to keep to</br> ourselves. My parents just raised us with that mentality that we're here,</br> we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home</br> and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,</br> didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't</br> seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just</br> that mindset that, &quot;Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and</br> something bad might happen.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So definitely…When I asked you the question, Do you fear the US</br> authorities, that was a dominant part of your childhood?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Most definitely. Going to the United States from Mexico my dad</br> still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had</br> to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending</br> because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left</br> alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many</br> times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or</br> I would have a friend that said, &quot;Let's go do this,&quot; I'll be, &quot;No, I'm</br> going to get in trouble.&quot; Or, &quot;No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from</br> here.&quot; And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had</br> Chicanos—which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that</br> were born there—and then we had the Wetbacks.

And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, &quot;Oh I</br> have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback.&quot; And so that was</br> very, very, very difficult for me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did you have anyone to talk to about this or is this really</br> something that you just had to go through individually?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My sister, me and my sister—my sister's one year older than me—it</br> was basically me and her. If it was her being offered something, we would</br> just console each other. We would just tell each other, &quot;No, you did good.</br> It doesn't matter if you don't get the reward, it doesn't matter if you</br> don't get the prize, you did it, you got that mail certificate.&quot; So it was</br> just me and my sister.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So like in those situations, you might receive potential</br> opportunities but like, no, you can't pursue them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle</br> school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.</br> There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading</br> teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching</br> wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the</br> book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: In what grade?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I</br> feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're</br> saying I'm doing good.&quot; And I'm sorry, what was the question?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,</br> like refusing those opportunities.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I</br> got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front</br> of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on</br> Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point</br> where you search my name and my poem came up.

But at the end of the day, it was that</br> risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get</br> deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was it about?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,</br> yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you</br> pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition</br> for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that</br> you can't go over.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that &quot;No, you can't.&quot;</br> Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working</br> for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,</br> what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time</br> staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.</br> So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of</br> the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that</br> work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior</br> year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on</br> it was basically work, work, work. And that was basically my life after</br> junior year—just work and work.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you</br> tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving</br> around from there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction</br> and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very</br> physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,</br> he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me</br> along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to</br> want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and</br> literally just because I had his last name, it was, &quot;Okay, you got the</br> job.&quot; And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would</br> call him offering jobs or—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, &quot;Okay, I might not be able to go</br> to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own</br> kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.&quot; And so being</br> under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were</br> points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son</br> anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be</br> like, &quot;Yeah, I know who you are.&quot; At first it was all like, &quot;Okay, who are</br> you?&quot; “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then</br> after a while it was, &quot;Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you</br> and we need you to pick our store back up.&quot; And so after that, that was my</br> goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just</br> because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me</br> learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,</br> that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start</br> pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your</br> father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had</br> to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?</br> Were you together?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had</br> legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a</br> little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point</br> where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,</br> so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many</br> times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age</br> of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.</br> And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I</br> could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a</br> father.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'</br> house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got</br> my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to</br> support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.</br> So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something</br> bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It</br> was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make</br> it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you</br> were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security</br> cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than</br> what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,</br> or anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there</br> know that you were undocumented or that are younger?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 16.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I</br> Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,</br> and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know</br> you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you</br> work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the</br> other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Oh very.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Very much like more high end?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: [Affirmative noise].</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly</br> young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's enough credit.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would</br> get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're</br> at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.</br> And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The</br> reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,</br> and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also</br> be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all</br> like, &quot;Okay, so who's in charge?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that's when I said, &quot;Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to</br> do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it</br> and I got my name out there.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really</br> making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I</br> guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just</br> going into those in more detail.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,</br> 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It</br> was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in</br> the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was</br> that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we</br> weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a</br> breather, she's, &quot;No, we got to talk because we have to talk.&quot; And so that</br> day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,</br> she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I</br> saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Swooped up the baby?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the</br> floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of</br> stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off</br> with my kids—I love my kids to death.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into</br> elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,</br> because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going</br> to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from</br> school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have</br> problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're</br> going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck</br> together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we</br> didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we</br> loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to</br> take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I</br> called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put</br> her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we</br> were literally tugging at the car seat.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in</br> a car seat. I told my little brothers, &quot;You know what, I need you to sit</br> down and help me.&quot; Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want</br> anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need</br> you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two</br> brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the</br> other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they</br> told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts</br> your hands on each other, then you can call us.”</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never</br> came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out</br> of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I</br> had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two</br> daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the</br> toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the</br> back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told</br> them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off</br> with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't</br> want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's</br> crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,</br> something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they</br> would've showed up then, anyways—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: No, I‚</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I</br> called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have</br> ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, &quot;Take my kids, go watch</br> TV and just keep them entertained.&quot; So my wife took off, me and my kids</br> spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around</br> seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I</br> was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid</br> attention to my little baby and she said, &quot;She has a bruise.&quot; And I asked</br> her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her</br> ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, &quot;My</br> little baby got hurt, something happened.&quot; I didn’t tell my mom at the time</br> what had happened, and then I told her, &quot;What do I do?&quot; And she said,</br> &quot;Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.&quot;</br> We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers</br> were on me. They asked me, &quot;Where's the mother?&quot; And I told her, &quot;Well, the</br> mother's not here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: &quot;Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this</br> is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the</br> hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because</br> we have people that are waiting for you.&quot; As soon as I got to the hospital,</br> I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running</br> around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little</br> city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very</br> little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already</br> gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,</br> there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control</br> the situation or calm it down.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my</br> side of the story. She said, &quot;The little baby got hurt, I have four</br> children, I'm going to put you behind bars.&quot; My wife got there, they asked</br> her what happened and she said, &quot;It was his fault.&quot; This was around 1:00 AM</br> in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout</br> the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to</br> lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she</br> didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to</br> take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they</br> said, &quot;You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the</br> hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for</br> your arrest.&quot; And I told them, &quot;Okay, well hold on. What's going on?&quot; And</br> they said, &quot;We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little</br> baby.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told him, &quot;No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little</br> baby.&quot; And they said, &quot;Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give</br> you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to</br> go ahead and read you your rights.&quot; I didn't know what's going on, with</br> them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally</br> scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and</br> they told the police officer, &quot;No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't</br> have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them</br> a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.&quot;</br> So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next</br> morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout</br> the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already</br> went to my house and picked up my other children.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,</br> I called the police station and I told him, &quot;You know what? I need to know</br> whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's</br> going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I</br> don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,</br> I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something.&quot; And they</br> told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month</br> waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she</br> told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, &quot;Okay, well</br> what's next?&quot; And she said, &quot;I don't know son.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I told her, &quot;Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to</br> see what's going on.&quot; The next morning, I was on my way to the police</br> station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I</br> was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was</br> walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they</br> hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see</br> me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my</br> mom, &quot;Where's he at?&quot; And she said, &quot;He's walking to the police station as</br> we speak.&quot; Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.</br> They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,</br> and literally they greeted me with, &quot;Mr ____, how are you doing?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on</br> their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police</br> station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the</br> neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, &quot;Really? I'm literally</br> in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?&quot; And I was just the</br> biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me</br> that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out</br> that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't</br> sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the</br> hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their</br> police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense</br> whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the</br> detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, &quot;Who did</br> this?&quot; And I told her, &quot;You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works</br> for the state. My mom has her own daycare.&quot; Me and my mom went to the</br> clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to</br> think, &quot;Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the</br> baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my</br> baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that</br> you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type</br> of guilt.&quot; So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to</br> the hospital because he feels guilty.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,</br> there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I</br> presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I</br> was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years</br> or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25</br> years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all</br> until my lawyer said, &quot;This is where we're at. You want to protect your</br> wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,</br> you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out</br> her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,</br> and then—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Where are the kids?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, &quot;Let's go to</br> trial, I'm going to fight this.&quot; The next day the state called me, and they</br> said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, &quot;Okay.</br> So what's going to happen?&quot; She said, &quot;You've already done nine months.</br> You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.&quot; And I</br> said, &quot;Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,</br> I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever</br> she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.&quot; So I said, &quot;Okay,</br> I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an</br> immigration bond, so I should be good to go.&quot; As soon as I got to prison,</br> immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road</br> ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.</br> But I ended up being deported.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound</br> exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm</br> carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like</br> there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not</br> being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US</br> authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're</br> undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and</br> paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that</br> they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in</br> these situations.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the</br> altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and</br> she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, &quot;Please don't,</br> you're not leaving with my children.&quot; Like, when you said you're in a toxic</br> relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where</br> she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical</br> because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she</br> literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There</br> was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the</br> door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit</br> me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I</br> grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my</br> dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget</br> that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm</br> never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, &quot;Okay,</br> that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.&quot; So at first, she started</br> slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon</br> as she punched me in my eye, I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps</br> anymore, you're out of control.&quot; I held her, she was facing the wall, she</br> bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go</br> and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her</br> lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting</br> up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,</br> “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go</br> to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she</br> picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the</br> phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.</br> I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them</br> down and I told them, &quot;Hey, you know what, this is what happened.&quot; They</br> took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of</br> the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only</br> point it ever got to a physical altercation.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Just in the moment when your baby fell off the bed, was she pushed</br> back onto the bed and then that—</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: It was because of that same reason that she did not let me leave</br> the room. And so I got her, and I moved her away from the door. I literally</br> got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That is just such a tragic…Like it's the worst way that could have</br> gone. Again, I'm so sorry that it went like that. And thank you for sharing</br> that, and that was the most difficult thing to -</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: No, it's actually the very first time that I've been able to tell</br> this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to</br> embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s</br> Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids</br> literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My</br> first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw</br> lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I</br> was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke</br> down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I</br> used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I</br> walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult</br> mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to</br> say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,</br> for all that work to just be taken away just like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,</br> being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own</br> father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from</br> that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a</br> father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that</br> you never wanted to be.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was</br> the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me</br> and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want</br> to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my</br> kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.</br> I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are</br> they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you</br> had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,</br> socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on</br> your return?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent</br> the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't</br> want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and</br> I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, &quot;Will I get in trouble</br> if I walk around the streets with the beer?&quot; And she said, &quot;You'll be fine.</br> You have two or 300 pesos, right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah I just came back from the</br> United States, I have money.&quot; “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,</br> just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very</br> first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my</br> family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, &quot;Okay, well it's in my</br> blood. Let's go for it.&quot; And literally there will be times where I would</br> just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice</br> and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about</br> half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a</br> lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on</br> my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the</br> door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just</br> literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just</br> [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they</br> literally—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Who’s everybody?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family</br> sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They</br> literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because</br> just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it</br> was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,</br> very first time. So I told myself, &quot;How do you not remember this happening?</br> How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What</br> did you do?&quot; And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,</br> that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United</br> States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times</br> where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and</br> literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,</br> that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because</br> for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the</br> middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around</br> the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the</br> street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted</br> somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling</br> me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,</br> and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a</br> big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any</br> of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there</br> she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,</br> she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she</br> was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.</br> So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, &quot;You know what,</br> your son is doing this&quot; [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and</br> that's when I said, I told my mom, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my</br> father did, so I'm done.&quot; And that was it. That's when I said, &quot;I'm not</br> going to do this again to my mom.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: And that was kind of like your early experience, kind of struggling</br> to be back in Mexico and come to terms with not being with your family. So</br> where did you go from there, not only just job wise but, also, how long</br> have you been back? And like what's been going on since then?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, from there they said I needed some time for myself to think.</br> So I got offered a trip to Cancun, they paid for a month for me to be in</br> Cancun. And literally I just vacationed and spend some time there. And I</br> went with a cousin and we literally had so much fun that I said, &quot;You know</br> what, maybe things will be alright. From the difference of coming here to</br> the state of Mexico and going to Cancun, Cancun was more lifestyle of what</br> I was used to, more English, everything was so pretty. So I was like,</br> &quot;Okay, well they have places like this in Mexico, so maybe I could do this,</br> maybe I could bring my kids down here.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And I spent a month in Cancun. And from there I came back to the</br> city and I tried Uber. It was very difficult for me because I didn't know</br> the traffic, how it worked. Literally all the speed bumps, I would pass</br> over them going very fast and people would freak out, but I would just</br> always tell them, &quot;You know what, over there in the United States, they'll</br> let you know if the speed bumps are coming&quot; [Both laugh]. And so, I wasn't</br> able to do Uber; I got kicked out of Uber. I tried doing my studies, that</br> was very difficult and I'm still not able to do it because they won't</br> validate my credits that I have from high school. They said that I have to</br> go literally start from elementary all the way up. So I couldn't continue</br> with my schools.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: That got put on pause. And so I started visiting Mexico City. I</br> started walking around Mexico City, the nice areas and that's when I</br> started learning about these call centers. I applied for a call center, and</br> it seemed all right money, compared to what everybody else was making. And,</br> you know, it wasn't anywhere close to what I was making the United States,</br> but for this lifestyle of me in Mexico City, it was all right. And that was</br> difficult for me as well because I lived in the state. And so I would have</br> to transport three, four hours to get to my job. I would have to wake up at</br> 4:00 in the morning and get to my job at 8:00 in the morning. And I'd come</br> home at 11:00, 12:00 at night.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so that went on for about four or five months until I literally</br> said, “I can't do this anymore.” I resigned from AT&amp;amp;T, and I've</br> literally been stuck since then besides from my mom giving me what she</br> can—my mom doesn't work so the main income is from my father. Me and my</br> father not having that awesome relationship, I feel shameful asking for him</br> for anything. So, there'd be times where my mom would send me $10, $20, and</br> literally got me two or three days, and that's literally how it's been</br> going on for past couple of months.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Until recently I was staying with family, and one thing led to</br> another—my aunt from the United States visited and she did not like how</br> things were going for me. She said, &quot;You're just sitting around, and you</br> have no need to work because people are sending you money, so I'm going to</br> give you a need to work.&quot; [Chuckles]. And she kicked me out. And literally</br> that was two days ago. So that's where I found New Comienzos. I've been</br> running around trying to try to get help because literally right now, I'm</br> on my own. I literally had to break down to my dad. I broke down, and I</br> told him, &quot;I need your help. I need you to be there.&quot; And he heard me, and</br> so just yesterday I got my apartment, and, you know, moving forward.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Yeah. I understand how you would really not want to ask anything</br> from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped</br> one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s</br> important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for</br> detention for two months?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Yes.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Two months. Do you mind just touching on the conditions or like the</br> treatment you experienced there?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the</br> immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things</br> breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary</br> was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,</br> they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their</br> case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,</br> citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask</br> them, &quot;If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, &quot;Well,</br> you know, they deport you tomorrow.&quot; And I called my dad and I told him,</br> &quot;Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be</br> here. I'll sign my deportation.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that</br> to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge</br> and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and</br> you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're</br> considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact</br> words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,</br> &quot;Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my</br> brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this.&quot; And</br> it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no</br> emotion with him. It was, &quot;No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.</br> But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: So it was like, &quot;Why are you giving me the option to fight my case</br> if...[Sigh]&quot; So I told him, &quot;Okay, well let's sign.&quot; And literally the next</br> day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be</br> there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and</br> literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on</br> their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, &quot;If they can't</br> do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?&quot; And that</br> was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't</br> be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.</br> I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way</br> of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had</br> to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want</br> anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a</br> father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be</br> imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there</br> will be a lot of guards that would tell me, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And</br> there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,</br> &quot;Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his</br> rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a</br> criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal.&quot; And it was just so</br> hard for me to stay focused on, &quot;No, you got to get out of this, you're</br> going to get out of this.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just</br> explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much</br> on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called</br> something, it was just put your head down and, &quot;Okay, no, you're right.&quot;</br> And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in</br> immigration. It was just that, &quot;You're a dirty Mexican.&quot; And there was</br> nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it</br> was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,</br> do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the</br> way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself</br> and I didn't mess what anybody.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: If things had gone a different way, and that moment that you</br> describe hadn't happened, what do you think you would be doing, like what</br> would be your dreams to do in the United States?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: To have my store, to have my restaurants. I want my restaurant and</br> I still want it.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: What would you call it?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: All styles, all around the world restaurant. That's what I want,</br> all around the world restaurant. Something from every place. And that's</br> what I wanted to, I want to travel the world, I want to learn every single</br> style of cooking. I got Italian down, I got American style down, and I had</br> a little bit of the London, English, all that. And I just want to keep</br> learning, and I want to expand my portfolio, I want to learn as much as</br> there is, and that's my dream one day to have my own store, maybe here in</br> Mexico—most definitely here in Mexico because I really don't see any</br> chances for me to go back.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: So that's your plan for Mexico too, or your dream?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: My dream to have my own store. That's my dream, that's my goal, to</br> have my own restaurant, that's my passion. I love the reaction from the</br> clients and I just love making good food.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: That's awesome. Well, I hope you pursue that dream. Just some</br> general questions that we like to touch on, you can take them whichever</br> direction you want. Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American or do</br> you consider yourself Mexican or American?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: American.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: American, 100%?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: 100% American.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Why do you think that is?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking</br> around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].</br> So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I</br> talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I</br> guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it</br> and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and</br> down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't</br> belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and</br> I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much</br> all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all</br> that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal</br> ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in</br> America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was</br> some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Despite your own experience with the US justice system, you have</br> like a larger faith that it is still like less corrupt than Mexico. Is that</br> kind of what you're saying?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Well, it's very difficult because in the United States, when I</br> would think about corruptions or anything like that, I think about families</br> getting separated, all this stuff that's going on now with the news, with</br> the President. Those are the bad things that I see up at the United States,</br> about just this one guy has a problem with -- had an argument with one</br> Mexican one day and it ruined his image for the rest of his life, and now a</br> whole country has to has to suffer because of that. And I feel like the</br> corruption here in Mexico is more inside of Mexico, more of being corrupt</br> here and not having to do anything with any other countries or anything</br> like that. But I do feel like there could've been more done.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: There could have been more people that heard my story, there could</br> have been... Somebody should have said this is not right. Somebody</br> should've said the police report is not right. I promise anybody could read</br> the police report and it makes no sense, it makes no sense whatsoever. And</br> I just feel like somebody could have said, &quot;Well, hold on, this makes no</br> sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened.&quot; But it was never,</br> &quot;Okay, what happened?&quot; It was always, &quot;Okay, you did this.&quot; So that's where</br> I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had</br> no voice—and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the</br> bad guy because a little baby got hurt.</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were</br> people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said</br> something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,</br> &quot;You know what, he did something,&quot; it was, &quot;You're going to jail,&quot; just</br> because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,</br> and just hearing all these stories, I was like, &quot;There's no way that I'm</br> going to get past this.&quot; And literally the very first offer was 30 years.</br> 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had</br> to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was</br> not me, I wasn't what they had on paper. I was not that person, I was</br> different, I was completely—</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Opposite of the criminals that you were surrounded by?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: Exactly. And just hearing all these stories of people going through</br> things in jail of all these things, I told myself, &quot;Why are you here then?</br> You're not supposed to be here. Why am I still here after six months? Why</br> am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing</br> for some time?&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going</br> to go home, you're going to see your mom.&quot; And then out of nowhere you get</br> this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, &quot;No, no, no, no,</br> no, no, no, no. That's not what's supposed to be happening. No.&quot; And so it</br> was like literally the world ended, and everything was taken just so fast.</br> The only things that I have left is pictures just because of the situation</br> that happened, I am not on good terms with the mother of my kids. And all</br> I'm left with is pictures and just memories and that's the hardest. Not</br> being able to just have some type of context, some type of pictures, or</br> recent pictures and updates, something, something, something, it's very</br> hard.</br>      </br>      </br> .Isabel: (pause) Is there anything else you would like to reflect on or you</br> people to know like before we wrap up?</br>      </br>      </br> Angelo: I plan to have a future, I'm going to have a future, and it's not</br> going to stop me. It's been hard, the past couple of years have been hard,</br> but I still have kids. I want them to be here, so this is not going to stop</br> me.</br>      </br>      </br> Isabel: Thank you so much for sharing.</br>      </div><\p>
